{"text": "\nimport ReactPlayer from 'react-player/lazy'\n\nLast November, we quietly introduced the private beta of the Weaviate Cloud Service, a fully managed vector database as a service. Today we are announcing a big upgrade to the Weaviate Cloud and availability of the public beta release of the service.\n\n\n\nThe Weaviate Cloud enables AI application developers to use the open source Weaviate vector database as a fully managed cloud service. It\u2019s the easiest way to get a vector database cluster up and running within minutes, so you can get right to loading, vectorizing, and searching your data.\n\n## Thanks for all the early feedback!\n\nDuring the Weaviate Cloud private beta, we had several thousand people create free Weaviate Cloud sandboxes and try it out. We\u2019d like to thank everyone who tried it and gave us feedback; it was extremely helpful. We look forward to hearing about your experience with the new (and future versions), which you can still try for free here.\n\n## The Weaviate Cloud Service Public Beta\nHere\u2019s a quick overview of what\u2019s new and what\u2019s coming next.\n\n### Help yourself - Self-Service Provisioning Improvements\nOne of the biggest changes from the private beta to today\u2019s public beta release is automated Weviate database cluster provisioning. Immediately after signing up for a Weaviate Cloud account, you can begin creating, querying, securing, and controlling one or more databases via the Weaviate Cloud console. As a result of the automation improvements, newly created Weaviate database clusters will be ready for use within a minute or two.\n\nWeaviate Cloud Service Create Cluster Page \n\n### Weaviate Cloud Service runs on Google Cloud (other clouds & on-premises are options too)\nThe Weaviate Cloud Service runs on Google Cloud, and by default, new Weaviate database clusters are provisioned to run on Google Cloud. When you create a new cluster, you can choose a specific Google Cloud location (region) on which to run your database cluster. We do plan to make Weaviate Cloud available on AWS and Azure; stay tuned for news on that!\n\n### Hybrid SaaS Option - Fully Managed, on Your Cloud\nIf you\u2019d like your database hosted on a dedicated private cloud, you can contact us and request a Hybrid-SaaS cluster. With the Hybrid-SaaS option, Weaviate will set up and manage your database cluster on a dedicated private cloud system on the cloud platform of your choice or on premises in your data center.\n\n## The Full Power of the Weaviate Vector Database\nThe Weaviate Cloud is always updated with the latest Weaviate open source database version and functionality. If you\u2019ve been using Weaviate Cloud since its release, you\u2019ve seen it enhanced with new core Weaviate database functionality, such as:\n\n- ChatGPT plug-in\n- Bitmap indexing for faster filtered search\n- HNSW-PQ index and data compression for greater cost efficiency\n- Database replication\n- WAND and BM25 search\n- Cursor API for processing query results\n\n## Develop More Productively - Interactive Admin & Query Console\nWe care a lot about the Weaviate user experience, so developer productivity is a top design priority. Hence, we implemented many new features in the Weaviate Cloud Console, which now allows you to administer your Weaviate clusters - create, delete, restore, monitor your clusters and activate high-availability settings.\n\nWeaviate Cloud Service Console \n\nThe console also features a GraphQL IDE that allows you to interactively query your Weaviate databases. The GraphQL query editor features:\n\n- Syntax highlighting\n- Intelligent type ahead of fields, arguments, types, and more\n- Real-time error highlighting and reporting for queries and variables\n- Automatic query and variables completion\n\n\nWeaviate Cloud Service GraphQL IDE \n\n## Control Access to Weaviate - API Key Management\nTo help make it easy to control access to your vector databases, all Weaviate Cloud instances can generate API keys with full admin (read and write) access. Read-only API keys are also supported for paid clusters.\n\n\nAPI Key Management in Weaviate Cloud Service\n\n## Next Stop, GA\u2026\nThe Weaviate Cloud is in public beta. General Availability is planned for release later in 2023, after we\u2019ve addressed feedback from public beta users.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to try Weaviate Cloud, you can create a free Weaviate Cloud Sandbox here.\n\nAnd if you have questions or feedback, please join the Weaviate community on Slack. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nimport WhatNext from '/_includes/what-next.mdx'\n\n\n", "type": "Blog", "name": "blog-wcs-public-beta", "path": "blog/2023-05-02-wcs-public-beta/index.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/blog/wcs-public-beta", "timestamp": "2023-11-13 10:42:18", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
