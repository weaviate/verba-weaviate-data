{"text": "\nTeam Weaviate attended our first [Google Cloud](/partners/gcp) Next and we had a blast! We connected with folks from our community, made lots of new friends, and shared our latest product features and trend predictions. Check out some of the highlights from our week in Vegas and a few things we learned along the way.\n\n## The app-mosphere is changing fast\nOur team spoke with hundreds of people who came by our booth \u2013 whether they were learning about genAI for the first time or were elbows deep into their latest application in production. Here are some observations from our folks on site:\n\n**The vector database is cementing its place in the new AI stack**. Conversations have changed since our last big conference. GenAI projects are moving forward and teams have a better idea of the stack they need to achieve their goals. We talked with a lot of people who had hands-on experience with vector databases, where six months ago most were still just learning what a vector database was.\n\n**Enterprises \ud83d\udc9a open source**. People gravitated toward our booth because of our *We \ud83d\udc9a open source* stickers and the open source messaging on our signage. Highly-regulated organizations \u2013 due to regional data compliance or security standards requiring data to stay on-premises \u2013 are drawn to databases like Weaviate because they can be deployed anywhere while maintaining a high level of performance.\n\n\n**Lots (and lots) of use cases**. People in every industry are building AI applications. At our booth, the large majority of visitors came from financial services, retail, and media. They\u2019re working to build solutions for document search, inventory search and management, and marketing content generation. A few were also looking into migrating codebases from one language to another.\n\n**Quantization and rescoring are all the rage**. We received a lot of questions from people interested in optimizing efficiency of their AI setup and how these concepts work within Weaviate. If you\u2019re curious, check out [this blog post about binary quantization](/blog/binary-quantization) and [this one about product quantization and rescoring](/blog/pq-rescoring).\n\n## Breakout session: From RAG to Autonomous apps with Weaviate and Gemini on Google Kubernetes Engine\n\n\n    \n\n\nOur CEO Bob joined Brian Kaufman, Senior Product Manager from Google Cloud, to teach users how to:\n\n* Deploy Weaviate on Google Kubernetes Engine\n* Set up a pipeline to ingest data from the Cloud Storage bucket\n* Query, RAG, and enhance the responses\u2026 all with just a few lines of code! \n\nIf you want to give it a try for yourself, [explore the GitHub repository here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ai-on-gke/tree/main/tutorials-and-examples/vector-databases/NEXT-2024-Weaviate-Demo).\n\n## Our favorite Google Cloud product announcements\nNext is Google Cloud\u2019s big annual conference, so of course we were waiting to see what new products and features would be announced at the keynote. Here are some of our favorites:\n\n* The newly announced [VertexAI Agent Builder](https://cloud.google.com/products/agent-builder?hl=en), a suite of tools helping developers build enterprise-ready AI applications, is now in preview. You can orchestrate the agent pipeline with LangChain! \n* [Google Gemini 1.5 Pro](https://developers.googleblog.com/2024/04/gemini-15-pro-in-public-preview-with-new-features.html?m=1) and its new embedding model is now available in 180+ countries.\n* There are [two new open-source Gemma models](https://developers.googleblog.com/2024/04/gemma-family-expands.html?m=1) tailored to developers and researchers.\n* Gemini is now integrated with Google Workspace \u2013 think Docs / Slides / Sheets / Vids \u2013 and we\u2019re excited to see what new capabilities this unlocks.\n\n## Weaviate winners\nWe\u2019re a fully remote company, so our team has a ton of fun when we\u2019re together in person. It\u2019s always a good time getting the crowd excited for our booth giveaways and seeing the joy in their faces when they win (or don\u2019t and can have a good laugh about it). This time around we gave away clicky-clacky Keychron keyboards and some crowd-favorite Lego sets.\n\n![Group pic](./img/group-pic.png)\n\n## What comes next?\n**Google I/O**: Google\u2019s developer conference is happening on May 14th in Mountain View, CA. Keep an eye out for some big announcements, maybe even from your favorite vector database. \ud83d\ude09\n\n**In-person**: On May 21st, we\u2019re hosting an in-person event in New York City with our friends from Google Cloud. The day will feature tech talks from industry leaders and customers will share their stories of building AI apps in production. After lunch (yes, there\u2019s food) we\u2019re hosting a free training where you can earn a certificate for completing Sebastian\u2019s famous Intro to Building AI-Native Applications course. [Request a ticket here](https://events.weaviate.io/ai-in-prod-ny-24). \ud83d\udc9a\n\n**Virtual fundraiser**: We got invited to participate in the Solve with Google Hackathon at the [Prinses M\u00e1xima Centrum voor kinderoncologie](https://www.linkedin.com/company/prinses-m-xima-centrum-voor-kinderoncologie/). We\u2019ll be supporting hospital staff and the attending data science and machine learning teams to build generative AI projects using Google Gemini and Weaviate. We\u2019re raising money to support these awesome kids, so if you\u2019re interested, [you can donate here](https://www.maximaalinactie.nl/fundraisers/weaviate-for-good). Even a small amount can make a world of difference to the children who receive medical treatment at the Princess M\u00e1xima Center. \ud83e\udef6\n\nimport WhatNext from '/_includes/what-next.mdx'\n\n", "type": "Blog", "name": "Blog Next-recap", "path": "blog/2024-04-24-next-recap/index.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/blog/google-next-recap", "timestamp": "2024-05-08 10:52:06", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
