{"text": "\nCelebrating Hacktoberfest 2023 with Weaviate\n\nAt Weaviate, we love open source! Join us in celebrating Hacktoberfest, a month-long celebration of open source!\nParticipants with four pull requests (PR) accepted between **October 1 - 31, 2023** will receive a unique digital reward from Hacktoberfest.\n\n\n## The Task\n\nWelcome to our demo sprint!\n\nIt is aimed at onboarding engineers and machine learning practitioners to open-source. In our example use cases and demos page, we showcase what you can do with a vector database. Some of these demos have received more love than others recently, and we want to give them a little polish.\n\nUntitled\n\nThe gallery contains demos using Weaviate in different states. Here is an example of a demo project in a good state. While some may only need a little polish of the description (README.md file), others are e.g., a little older or can use a little makeover for the user interface.\n\nThe steps to your first Hacktoberfest PR are simple:\n\n1. Find an issue you're interested in: Go to the example use cases and demos page and select a project marked for Hacktober with a \ud83c\udf83\u00a0sign. Click on \u201ccode\u201d to get to the repository and have a look at its issues.\n\n\n  \nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n\n\n2. Ping us on the project\u2019s issue, saying you're interested and which parts of the issue you would like to contribute to.\n3. Open the PR as instructed in the Weaviate Contributor Guide. We will review and help you out in the process. \ud83d\udc9a\n\nYou can also contribute by adding your own Weaviate examples. If you have other great ideas for contributions, let us know on our Discourse and Slack channels, and we will figure out how to highlight it in Hacktoberfest.\n\nYou don't need to be an expert to contribute to these demo projects!\n\n\n## Resources to Get Started\n\nWe're thrilled to help you make your first open-source contribution!
