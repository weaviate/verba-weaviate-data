{"text": "Hey everyone, thank you so much for watching the 52nd episode of the Weaviate Podcast with Yana Welinder! Yana is the ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for watching the wevia podcast I'm super excited to welcome Yana wellender the CEO and founder of craftful craftful is one of the Chachi BT plugins that has captured my imagination on what this kind of thing could look like it's really shown me uh what this kind of idea of a product manager kind of compressed into prompt templates and all these things so I'm so excited to welcome you all into the podcast I also uh so I reached out to you on that asking if she joined the podcast to talk about craftful and also did some more research on Yana and you have such an amazing background in uh in Stanford law school and all these cool things that I think you'll offer you know so much information to the podcast and our listeners hopefully so Jana thank you so much for joining the podcast thanks for having me really really excited to be here awesome so could we maybe start with maybe like the overview of uh craftful and then I think we could dive more into the product management the the components of it and then maybe come back into the chat gbt Marketplace absolutely yeah so so craftful we're building this complete copilot for product managers and other product Builders but this idea that um our number one place where we start is to help you make sense of all the different user data that you're getting from various sources uh we also help you understand kind of how to do product management really well that's really where where our plugin comes into play um but over time we want to be that co-pilot for for product Builders to to automate away all the tedious tasks so that's uh folks can focus on the stuff they're really really passionate about like building building awesome products using all of this information yeah it's amazing I mean I because to me it's like the the the workflows the common skills that are used across product management that you've abstracted into prompts can you kind of talk a little bit more like I know user feedback is one example I saw on craftful yeah absolutely so I think user feedback is really kind of like one of the most important roles of a product manager is to really understand the user and understand the user needs and so that involves collecting user feedback um but also you know deciphering that feedback right from from lots of different sources so that's that's both qualitative user feedback like user interview notes and and surveys and quantitative so usage data uh analytics that kind of stuff um but on the qualitative side I would say kind of the best PMS tend to not just use the stuff that they get from um from surveys and user interview notes because you usually with that you're Gathering a small group of people and you're asking them lots of questions so it's not necessarily super representative of your uh user base and even even if you can manage to get it very representative it's it tends to be quite detached from The Experience itself you also have this um volume of user feedback that that the company gets through various channels that can sometimes be much more in in the flow of a user actually using a product and having an experience and giving you feedback on that so that's things like obviously App Store reviews but also support tickets sales call transcripts all of that body of feedback you really want to be able to incorporate into the product development process but then of course the PM then has all of these other things that they're supposed to be doing that that's much more that's much more uh you know in their day-to-day like it's communicating with stakeholders uh coordinating the dev Team all of those individuals are constantly kind of like screaming at the PM the users are not doing that in the same kind of way where it's visible whether you listen to the users or you don't right so that tends to get almost de-prioritized even though it's the most critical component of product management and and so I so there are some kind of like typical best practices for managing user feedback that say like you know professional product managers would would study and so so are these then compressed into prompts and then that so like the chat gbt plug-in is it like a set of problems for you know here's a CSV uh with data about like a user interview study we did and then so the The Prompt is like how to analyze the data and um and like chat with with you know Conor the product manager yeah um so I guess what one thing that I should kind of uh clarify up front is what what our plugin does today is just a subset of what craftful does which actually does not include analysis of user feedback as it is today um that's and I can talk about kind of why why we made those product choices uh and uh there's there's a lot that went into kind of the defining scope of the plug-in versus the full product but in the full product and that's exactly right and so we we really are applying certain prompts to user feedback to get the kind of insights you would want to get out of the feedback to be able to um to make the product better specifically we're we're trying to get at the the feature requests what people love about the product what they complain uh about the product um and then we've designed the flow where you get by default these kind of General product topics and then you can dive deeper and we tell you what kind of questions you may want to ask to get at more kind of insightful information specific to your products in features out of all of the body of user feedback can we do that with the chat that has kind of a personality or or the reasoning of a product manager so that it it's not exactly like chat that it's it's just a different personality which is like it's not as chatty it's not as fun it's much more of a PM yeah that's so interesting so it's like a it's like a role-playing you have like role-playing prompts where you you add some extra context like because I remember like being like in the beginning of um chat GBC people be like you are young lacun like famous AI scientists and it would result in a better response by kind of protecting it that way I mean so so I guess so I guess the other thing like we think about a lot about like retrieval augment to generation at webva Vector databases like you know how do you take your specific information and then you take a search query retrieve the specific information pass the language model you know to get better responses is that kind of a part of craftful as well as is creating like this you know information store of product management best practices so that so that you kind of you know and then you offer that as the product we have we kind of have two essentially two flows one is one is around user feedback analysis and the other is around um looking at all the different product best practices that are out the internet is a very noisy place when it comes to product in particular because everyone sort of think of themselves as a kind of person so there's just so much information out there that if you just ask ask this question to the internet or ask it to the internet via chat gbt um you're not likely to get very insightful answers or they may seem insightful but they're not necessarily going to be and so we really try to almost curate what is what are the actual best practices that what is the that body of feedback so that we can guide you uh through that and then ultimately we want those two um those two features to meet in the middle where actually the analysis is leveraging the best practices so that we can uh other than just our best practices that we already kind of uh um built into the product to constantly evolve based on all of the different kind of the different flows in in channels that we're getting it's amazing it's like so amazing how uh yeah you take such a complex algorithm like you know being a product manager and then you compress you turn it into software in this new kind of Paradigm of that I think there are so many interesting things that the first of which that I want to break apart is this concept of like you know you you've curated this information do you think like the value going forward of having a highly curated set of information will increase over time because of products like this and the chat gbt yeah I mean I think I think generally just like classifying what is high quality and what is not I think over time just based on the usage there's probably going to be lots of data there that will help determine what what's a what's a high quality Source versus a low quality Source I don't I don't imagine this being kind of like the relevancy um algorithm in Google but something because that too is not necessarily doesn't give you some a real sense of quality necessarily it just it's a sense of popularity um but I think this some something like that I think over time I imagine being a part of um both specific tools like ours and also just generally kind of like Chachi pity another um chat Bots that they become better at getting a sense of what's what's good and what's bad over time based on you know just having humans in the loop and interacting with the with the feedback yeah it it makes me think a lot about like the future of kind of like content creation kind of and like how you interact with people's content like you know I trust your advice for product management so like whatever you're curating like as it is now it's like say you know you had a YouTube channel where you were kind of like saying here's the news about here's here's the new stuff and and now it's like instead of just kind of creating like videos or blog posts and stuff now you create like this uh this thing that is like uh it's like a it is like software from your knowledge kind of is it is to me it's like a new kind of course almost like it's like it is yeah like the evolution of like information products it I think it's quite passing with this thing so maybe pivoting topics I really wanted to get your perspective on kind of the chat gbt Marketplace and you mentioned that craftful so it sounds like you're you're on both sides of the fence where the API lives in craftful which is like your software and then you also bring it to the plug-in Marketplace how are you seeing these two things yeah so in on on our side on the craftful side we obviously we leverage a lot of different models so it's a combination of both both the turbo model which is really the only thing that that our plugin gets to interact with but also uh gpt3 and gpt4 and you know we have various ways to combine that together to be able to um interact with something that's a much larger than the context window that we would be able to to leverage directly into activity so that's a very different and that's kind of what we need to have for this like body of feedback where you're constantly feeding support tickets right like that's going to be that's gonna be a ton of data and then on the other side of that in in the plugin um so we were actually very very early with developing our plugin I think we were on the first cohort of developers developing ours we we launched we were in the first group of folks launching it in in the in the plugin store um and in fact that was sort of an interesting aspect in its own right because when we lunch there wasn't a whole lot of users that had access to plugins so we weren't getting feedback just in the very early days and then well people adopted and started getting feedback on it but um one thing that we've been really mindful of uh when designing our Plugin or thinking through what's what what features should we offer today that's not that's not to say that's over time it's not going to have much more of what what craft was today but um the the kind of uh things we're thinking about is what does that user experience look like and what's easy for a user to do through a plugin I think there I was very much leaning on and in a prior life prior to craftful I was head of product at ift or IFTTT if you've heard about any any of those names um and uh in in and so obviously we were this um Integrations platform where users were enabling uh Integrations between different products via ift and the big observation for me was always that authentication was really the drop-off in the user experience and so any point where you have to authenticate um and then second to that was any kind of settings um and so we really were mindful of that that this is this is a very new user experience that's going to be really tricky for people to kind of understand okay chat GPT in itself is new then plugins on top of that are new users are going to struggle with that so if if we on top of that add on anything that requires authentication uh and then have you know specific settings that you kind of need to have for for the kind of experience we currently have on craftful proper um that's probably going to mean that no one's going to use that plugin so um so we're just sort of just thinking through out of all the things that craftful is what can we bring to chat gbt that's actually going to be valuable people will use and so that's where the product coach was came into place was like that's you don't need to authenticate anything uh you don't you can really just start using it and ask it questions and and about best practices and uh and I think so far it's turned out to be true like people have had lots of use of it because it's been so easy to use compared to you know some some of the other plugins because it's just it's it's it's complicated it's going to get easier over time but it is so far it's complicated to use yeah yeah that's so powerful I think um it makes me think uh like I don't know if this is too much of a like too much of a stretch to compare it to say like how you kind of tailor your content to different uh like social media platforms like to Twitter I write a short you know description of text Medium right along article like and so it's like you've you've taken apart a particular part of your product that fit that can live on the plug-in Marketplace but then the the your website has more functionality and so maybe I think even a better better knowledge that's a great analogy but then the other thing is sort of like how you've previously would be designing your product to be to live on the web in one context because that's where you're sitting next to your computer or it's on your phone right that you're on on the go you're gonna want things more short form that's kind of why Twitter is short form too um and sort of there's already examples of that where you're developing products for different platforms uh and and you kind of have to take into account what's that user experience look like yeah that's definitely a better example yeah um so I think so with but when you do have user data you can get a much better experience because you you know it becomes like a data management platform so as so can you walk me through a little more about how the full craftful Works how it collects all the data and sends that to chat gbt and just kind of how you think about that kind of system design yeah absolutely so on on craftful um users um sign in and then the very first thing they're invite us to because we really want you to have that aha moment as quickly as possible is to connect your data sources and so you can you can do things like uh connect your support tickets that's usually an oauth uh well uh or you can select an app from uh from iOS or or Android apps and then you load App Store reviews for for that app uh or you can upload CSV files or uh or just a tech stock to analyze that's usually for things like user entry notes or or call all transcripts and then we run a combination of prompts on all of that feedbacks we pull we pull in on all of that feedback we break it down when it's a large volume of feedback and we kind of we do what we call it kind of summaries of summaries where we run types of prompts to summarize it in certain ways and then we apply these product prompts uh on on this data to get product insights from them um and then on top of that we in with with that we use a combination of gbt3 gpt4 and actually also turbo because because it does make sense in certain contexts um and then and then then there's two things you can do with that one is you can you can chat with some race of feedback on top of that to kind of learn more Beyond specifically what we the the insights that we pulled out for you automatically and then the other thing you can do is to use something that we call our reverse analysis where we we actually do the opposite way um Associates summaries that we got kind of the product specific summaries that we got to the original feedback so that you can read that feedback in context and learn more about what the user actually wanted or what you know kind of like a little bit more about what what's actually their problem Beyond specifically what they're asking for yeah there's um so I think a couple things apart is firstly I think that that kind of like summarization prompts I think just hearing again your like how you are using it is just a testimony to the power of that prompt like you know some problem like please summarize the following documents you'll receive them one at a time as well as a summary so far and just looping through that I think that problem has added so much value in so many ways um so I I definitely want to ask this kind of topic of like prompt engineering uh like this kind of idea of tweaking your prompts how much do you kind of tweak these problems did is it about like discovering totally new Concepts like the summaries or you mentioned it's kind of like invert the feedback kind of is that like a prompt as well or is it just like linking it is so we've I would say like the the origin the first uh prompts uh the earliest prompts uh for for what we have on craftful I kind of wrote back in like early 2020 and since then they've evolved so so so many times I probably have lost track of um so it's a constant Evolution and that is that that's a combination of how the models have evolved because back then prompt engineering is actually so much more complex than it is today um and so we like you had to have much much more complex prompts to get something something meaningful at all and at some point in much less problem engineering and you can kind of cut down on a lot of the additional stuff that you did to reason in certain ways um so that's one one kind of evolution uh of our prompt engineering the other type is just as we connected different types of sources some that are uh rich with product insights like say user interview notes uh versus some that are not so rich with with product insights like support tickets or or call transcripts we've learned a lot from uh those different types of um user feedback sources and how to apply different types of prompts to get to get product insights out of them right because we're not actually just summarizing um the the feedback we are really just looking for very specific types of insights in in all of that that feedback um so that's that's been the kind of the other kind of evolution and then and then on top of that is sort of like this additional piece around okay but now we're also building new features and those new features need a completely new set of prompts to enable things like reverse analysis so um well I I guess the other like a quick note before coming back to the prompt engineering topic is um I think in addition to that summarization chain the other thing is like mapreduce chain where you apply like um so like does this product review mention let's say ref is like a weba feature like does this product review mentioned rough to back and it just applies that on each chunk of user review and then takes those answers and then Aggregates them with another problem but yeah I think another just another I think like summarization chains and mapreduce those are like two of the most like ubiquitous prompts and then you have the specific example of and but so so you mentioned starting in 2020 so you you know must have been an early believer in like because you know I've been also working in AI like you know I was in my PhD this time not like working with you like um you know 2020 I don't I don't think it was you know clear that this was gonna succeed like this like you could just tell it to do a task and it could do the test yeah so so what made you kind of an early believer in just being able to prompt it so I think I I wasn't necessarily an early believer [Music] problems I've myself it's very first time I got to play around with this technology that's the that's this is the very problem I applied it to um and and I think actually my takeaway was that it didn't do a great job of it back then the first prototype I built wasn't wasn't summarizing feedback in a great way but I could I I started seeing the promise there and so I continued coming back to it I would say you know it wasn't actually we didn't have it in production until 2021 um and before that we had much more sort of like an analytics product um uh that analyzed interaction data much more so than than the the user feedback so it it was much more of a experimentation to see can can I solve this problem that I've had as a product manager um you know in in have been trying to um solve through you know thematic analysis tools and really not been uh happy with with that outcome um and so when I when I when I got access to to to experiment with uh with gpt3 back then that's kind of the first the first thing I applied it to well you know that's that's really really interesting um I mean yeah the I remember just so like the few shot prompting where you give a few examples maybe yeah wow that's so interesting um so pivoting topics a little bit I'm curious about um like your use of user data at craft foam design of the product like do you do you think about training your own large language models or like you know maybe fine-tuning it for your particular problem or like you know Connor using yeah yeah absolutely so I think we're definitely going to be fine-tuning a lot over time I don't imagine that's necessarily um training our own model though maybe maybe we will over time um I think you know the the the pace with which this is developing um it just doesn't seem like a really good um use of time um our team's time specifically uh because after all we are not we at least we don't think of ourselves as an AI company we do think or a product we do think of ourselves as a product management product solution right um and so the um but I do think that definitely fine-tuning um so I mentioned that we you know our chat behaves like a product manager and that's in some sense um a uh conceptually what we want our product to do so we want it you know to the extent that all large language models are behaving more and more like a human over time um or able to do more and more of human tasks we want our product to to do the tasks we're asking it to do more and more like a product manager or more and more like a product manager at a specific company as opposed to a you know uh customer support representative right um that's just a different type of way of analyzing data and we want uh to to kind of fine-tune um the model over time to be to to perform more like that and in the way we plan on doing that is just to have users provide feedback just um not directly but by interacting with the summaries and in all of the insights that they're getting through craftful in as they uh Mark certain summaries for use that's a good indication for us that that's a good summary right and everything that they didn't interact with well that's an indication that we don't want to have these kind of summaries over time so I think there's this is just a natural component where we can fine tune over time just based on interaction data yeah it's super interesting and um like because kind of wearing the product hat of the product that is craftful and so the feet so tweaking craftle means tweaking the prompts that in the summarization chain rather than tweaking rather than like having this whole ml Ops Pipeline and because I think that's an extremely interesting kind of development with the few shot zero shot learning abilities of the models and yeah like how it enables you to do that kind of thing um yeah maybe I don't know if this would be too like pivoting too much but I'm curious I'm curious a little further like what you mean by um you know a particular way of looking at data from a product management maybe if we could talk about like your the experience of your team like and how and kind of sort of like is that you know I I I'm not a product manager like what what does it entail generally yeah I mean I think like uh one uh just to give you give you kind of a concrete example um so we uh yet by applying various prompts we get lists of feature requests and then we get lists of complaints right and um and oftentimes um to a non-product manager they wouldn't necessarily know you know what's a what you know what's what specifically is a complaint versus What specifically is a feature request um they may know but I think if you were to ask um uh your support team to produce two lists you may see a mix of things on on those lists um and it's going to be kind of very varied I think if you ask a product manager it's going to be pretty you will get pretty solid lists on like here's your feature requests and here's your list of complaints you know that may vary based on organization there may be some specific things that are considered one thing and not the other um and so what we can imagine doing is when we present these two lists to a product manager you user that is looking at those lists and when they then select the features that they find interesting and they don't select the features that they do not that they find uninteresting and that we can see is there like maybe a match between those features and some things that have ended up on the complaints list um that's that's a good indication to us that actually that's why right like so there's there may be some some things that we can do around how a PM interacts with the output that we can then use to fine-tune the model to behave more like that PM in the future it's so fascinating just like um you know like I working in technology I struggle enormously with how the the tree of things I could do expands and trying to like you know prioritize and rank like what which of these like you know you you can do all these things which ones should you do so like how like so so conducting that res you know you have a list of 10 features and then you're thinking okay I think we only have time to do like three of these yeah and then so how do you rank yeah like how would someone like you think about how do you rank that so that's that's one one aspect of why we created that reverse analysis was really to give you a sense of a how frequently that each of these things come up uh and then B so you can go back to the original feedback and that's over time we'll have things like if if that's coming from your CRM data um it may have indications of the types of customers that are requesting One Thing versus another so it gives you kind of all the different things that you normally balance when you try to make sense of the data and uh and get a sense for okay this is a frequently requested feature but it's from all the users who are not gonna ever pay for our product right [Laughter] bring up yeah I mean yeah I really wanted I I had you know I had written down CRM because I really like because it seems like these AI tools are surely about to build bring a revolution in CRM and how we manage relationships we you know we recently published this article about this idea of using large language models to say right customize advertisements for you know in in this blog post we're talking about like you know you take Airbnb listings and you like synthesize a text description with the large language model then you write a custom review for like Connor because like you know I travel with my dog whereas Bob he likes to weight lift so he needs to know where the gym is so like you write these personalized summaries and it's like this kind of CRM do you think a lot about like because it seems like you're in a similar space it's not like quite a CRM but it is kind of yeah I mean I think there's in in our case there's going to be other things where we we do customize how we then like the you know you can imagine once you have all of these summaries you may then want to write your jira tickets with them that's that's the thing that's that we're working on right now like right uh stakeholder communication you don't necessarily want PMS to be going around and talking with everyone where that could easily have been handled and could be actually much more kind of sensitive to that specific person like that politics that is unnecessary um so I think there's there's a lot of those kind of aspects that we will have over time that's kind of what I mean by that whole product workflow uh there's so many things there that can be um can be uh customized uh or I should say automated and then customize to this each specific individual yeah that's a really interesting book I mean like just kind of my own intuition it's like sometimes like regardless of what I think might have the best payout it's like well what do I want to do kind of for sure yeah yeah I mean like um I'm curious what you think about this idea of like so pivoting topics a little bit again is like multi-aging systems where you have multiple large language models playing roles so like I'm the product manager role-playing large language model and then these are like eight engineer role-playing large language models marketing role-playing like what do you think about these kind of systems I think this is quite a yeah yeah I I honestly don't think that that's how uh or for a while that's how teams are going to operate I think like when you know when it gets close to like AGI yes but I think in on on the path there I'm much more envisioned the world where uh you have you know the AI enabled PM interacting with the AI enabled engineer and the AI uh marketer and all of them are essentially just like AI operators at that point right like no they're you have no code writers and you have no word writers but but I do still think that there's there like on at least as far as product development there's there's there is a certain aspect of um human intuition that is going to be pretty difficult to replace until we are very far along um and so I don't I think it's probably going to be less of a kind of an agent role-playing uh development process for now yeah I agree I guess I just find the idea to be well I I find it to be really fascinating especially with the you know like the software engineering kind of part where I think a lot about how the language models can write code and also kind of like test the code that I think the way that they can change it test it that's the part that really inspires my imagination because I yeah like this kind of feature uh request thing where it's like if I have 10 features they can eat each language model could take one and in parallel start prototyping it and testing it and seeing how difficult it's going to be and yeah yeah I think I think that so that's a really interesting idea I think something like that is probably gonna when I think about sort of like the AI enabled PM like what is that AI enabling that PM then um that there could be um like the the piece that is writing um the products spec right the AI That's writing the products back can then be challenged by the AI That's analyzing the user feedback um and you can have that that interaction I do imagine uh we'd probably have to kind of get to something that's that's better um so as it is today right like the um the writing of the spec is already influenced by the user feedback right so there is there's already that happening but you can imagine it's also kind of just like being more adversarial and challenging and um and maybe that will get at an even better outcome yeah amazing um so I I kind of um you know be stepping back into the high level again about the kind of you like you're you've prompted chat gbt to have a specific skill set of a product manager do you see like like a lot of related skills like that like prompted Mark like because it sort of sorry let me set the context a little more like as you're on the plug-in Marketplace so I'm pretty sure Crawford was like one of the most popular apps on there do you like look at the um you know the cohorts of who else is like doing successfully on the plug-in Marketplace and sort of see what they're building and what the trends are in successful plug-in Marketplace apps um we can't really do that other than we can see you know we we do we do we keep being listed just on Twitter as like one of the one of you know one of the better plugins out there like one of the top 10 plugins or top 20 plugins and that's really the only Insight at this point what's the other one you can see who's the other ones on the list but so far there's very limited analytics that we get by being uh on on the plugin store we've built up analytics just around you know how much how much questions are we getting um that sort of stuff just to see what what's what does the usage look like but we don't really have a sense on kind of it's just early days yeah it is pretty early days still right be like I know we have ABA uh gbt plug-in and I you know I don't work on that personally so I don't really know what it is but I like I don't know too much I would say I we've done like a hackathon around us I've seen people trying to build this thing but we still have it's still not quite like app store of it's too it's too early to say right at this current time but but you would pretty like the prediction is like would this be like a App Store type of thing like what's your sentiment on that myself is that there's something some something like that yes I do think that there's probably going to be something um some interface that people interact with all of their different you know agents or or apps yeah and I I think over time I imagine it's probably not going to be chat I would think it's you know it would be something combination of voice and in some visual interface or you know some something that is a little bit more intuitive um kind of like I think what we always what we always dreamed for like something like an Alexa but you absolutely never went in that direction right but but I think yes I I think there's something like that is coming and I do think that the the promise is there but it's just like very very early days so far and I think you'll probably again have a better analogy for this but like the the iPhone app store to me it has like the moat of like it's on the iPhone that's what enables all the apps really and you would say maybe the language model is that type of effect but then you can take the API and disentangle it from the you know the app the iPhone so that's where I think is a little of course you could like run on Android but is that and then I see the other side where it's like just kind of like a marketing play like kind of like how you know say product hunt has like a list of products and so like I see it as like either just the marketing like I did I know about craftful because I go to the plug-in Marketplace and I click on the apps and you know it's ranked it's high so do you see those kind of things as being the right way of thinking about it I think so yeah I mean I I think that it is it is very possible that there isn't going to be another way to interact with like apps or products or websites other than just going through something like chat gbt or or the chat GPT and interacting with plugins and and that that would be the app interaction um and so in that sense it would be analogous too it would be in one one analogy is the App Store another analogy would just be like that's the browser um what what actually is going to be is a little bit of an up in the air right now I think like the the folks who are developing in this space will all kind of have to be prepared for just going in different directions and and being okay with that and kind of preparing the team that yes you're developing this but actually it may end up looking like this or um you know like thinking of everything as um being as much API enabled as it can be because that makes it also easy to switch between different Platforms in in different kind of just like your specific uis um but yes I do think that most likely there will be some sort of um chat like chat GPT like experience that we'll be interacting with and do you think that the App Store is sort of like probably a good good analogy to that or the app store or the iPhone or the browser yeah yeah brilliant I think that's all a really great analysis and so sort of wrapping up the podcast I you know personally this has really inspired my interest in craft fall I'm definitely gonna go play with it right after this and you know I hope a lot of our listeners are people you know building things with we V8 and you know AI apps and could could maybe like you do the overview so like someone listening who's building some kind of AI product can you maybe do the introduction to craftful if it's not yeah so yeah so so craftful as I think you you summarize really well in the beginning for a co-pilot for product managers and product Builders it's really at this point um the way to summarize all of the different user feedback that you get from from from different sources so if you have um user feedback in app store reviews but also in zendesk support tickets or intercom or various docs or CSV files that you need to summarize you can then go in in summaries at all in craftful but specifically with this product angle and be able to connect it so that we're constantly then pulling that data and analyzing it and sending it to your mailbox so you don't have to worry about it and you can kind of just collaborate with your team on all of the feedback yeah and I think just the um like the the the skill of how to do user interviews is quite interesting like I you know I did a computer science degree and was just hacking with like I imagine a lot of people who listen to this podcast are also just like computer scientists and don't think about like how to conduct user interviews and save this kind of data so I think all that yeah the the angle of this this this is one of the like skill skills workflows compressed into like a charge EBT based app that has really captured my imagination more than anything else so also uh kind of in the spirit of podcast can you maybe tell people like how to keep up with you and updates and maybe any announcements coming up absolutely yeah so probably the best the best way to to keep up with me is I'm very active on Twitter I'm Jana tweets uh there um also uh can keep up with with craftful there our handle is just grapple um and that probably is the the easiest way to both keep up and and you know reach out to me and connect with me um the the next few things we have in the pipeline is just lots and lots of additional features obviously you are using craftful for craftful ourselves been overwhelmed with that which is um we do roll out new things pretty much every every week and so a lot of that is new Integrations new ways of analyzing the data new ways of summarizing it the jira tickets uh writing functionality that kind of alluded to that's coming uh soon too so lots lots and lots of exciting stuff awesome Diana thank you so much for your perspectives on all these things I learned so much and yeah it all sounds so exciting having me really a fun conversation ", "type":
