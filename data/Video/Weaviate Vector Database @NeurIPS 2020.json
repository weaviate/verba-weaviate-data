{"text": "Weaviate at the scientific conference NeurIPS 2020 (https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2020/). An introduction to vectorization and ... \nyeah so um welcome again \num this time again an online meetup \nbut organized locally in the netherlands \nuh so \nthis meetup this session is organized \naround the theme of the nurbs as you \nknow this is a scientific conference on \nthe neurological information processing \nsystems \nand here the latest machine learning and \nai \nresearch and papers are presented and \nas this year's nurbs event was hosted \nremotely local meetups are organized in \norder to connect with \nlocal and fellow ai researchers and \npeople interested in that field semi \ntechnologies were \nselected uh by the nurbs uh boards to \norganize and meet up in the netherlands \nso i want to thank a nurse for that uh \nfor this opportunity \nand uh yeah for you it's a nice \nopportunity to learn how \nmachine learning is applied in industry \nand how researchers \ncan actually benefit from an application \nof machine learning in industry \nso this meetup will or yeah this \npresentation will consist of \nof three parts mainly so uh first i will \nintroduce \nhow um this machine learning application \nis \nis applied in industry um yeah the \nvector search \nengine abbreviate mainly \nand i'll explain how what factorization \nis and \nand how it is done and why it is done \nand then how it enables semantic search \nand automatic classification \ni will then briefly uh explain how \nweavieat can also be used for \nresearch in academia next to the \nindustry cases \nand after that we can have um yeah we \nhave \ntime and room for questions we can have \nan open discussion and meet each other \nmaybe \nso first first about abbreviate itself \nso bv8 is the avi based semantic search \nengine \nand i will start with explaining the the \nproblem that \nuh lies behind what we've heard is \ntrying to solve \nso we found that \nuh 80 of data is actually unstructured \nor unstructured text \nand the problem with unstructured data \nis that it's really difficult to search \nthrough and it's \ndifficult to classify and this is hard \nbecause you need to \ndo some exact keyword matching or some \nfuzzy search but that's relatively \ndifficult \ncompared to if you just have structured \nstructured text \nand within the ai and machine learning \ndomain \nwe are we should all be familiar with \nunstructured data and classification \nand models and applications that can be \nbuilt and trained on \nunstructured data or data that is \nmanually structured in order to use \nimage learning models \nbut this means that it's rather labor \nintensive for the researchers and \ndata scientists to build all these \nmodels \nand in addition it's difficult to scale \nbecause these kind of models are \nmade for one use case only and \nthese two observations that we did in \nindustry that \nleads to um yeah the fact that machine \nlearning and \nartificial intelligence are great \nsolutions but it's \nit's in fact uh not applied very often \nin uh industry cases yet uh with \nunstructured data \num and that happens because it's hard to \nimplement for non-data scientists \nand it's rather labor intensive because \nyou need to do a lot of \npre-processing of the data if it's \nunstructured \nand yeah it's not scalable and that's \nexpensive \nand here's an example i can give on \n[Music] \nyeah unstructured text and how you can \nfind \nmeaning and additional information and \ninsights from that \nso this example comes from a real life \nuse case of vv8 \nin industry so we have a set of product \npreviews \nwhich is essentially just a bunch of \ntext per review \nand yeah you can see there's a lot of \nof uh meaning and a lot of uh insights \ncaptured \nin these reviews but these reviews are \nfree text \nso if we use uh traditional \nyeah so there's a lot of information \nhidden in there \nand without any machine learning or \nabbreviate \nthese kind of reviews are mainly \nmanually analyzed by humans working in \nthis case at this production company \nto see if how they can improve the \nproduct and \nmaybe if they can do more targeted \nmarketing to their customers \nbut yeah as you know this is of course \nvery labor intensive \nand mistakes can happen there and then \nin addition so if we use traditional \nmachine learning and search engines for \nthese reviews \na user will only be able to find reviews \nbased on exact matching keywords \nso this means that not always the ideal \nset of reviews \nwill be returned to the user um \nbecause yeah with different words in \ndifferent reviews you can actually \ncapture the same same meaning or same \nintention but they will be skipped \nbecause \nthe keywords don't match exactly \nso that's that's where rev8 comes in and \nwith abbreviate you can do this kind of \nfuzzy search so revade is a vector \nsearch engine \nwhich it differs from a traditional \nsearch engine \nand this means um yeah in a few words it \nmeans that it has machine learning \nmodels built in to index data \nand the automatic factor representation \nof data enables to search through this \ndata \nso you were able to find data without \nusing exact keywords \nand linking data with their contacts \nwhich happens automatically \nthen allows to search based on the \nconcepts \nand fuzzy terms rather than exact \nmatching keywords \nadditionally v8 is a graph like data \nmodel so it stores data as vectors in a \nhigh dimensional space \nbut it's also possible to connect data \nobjects \nand you can make explicit relations \nbetween data points because \nas we all know data in in real world is \nalways uh connected \nand then vv8 is completely api based so \nwe have a \nrestful endpoint but more importantly a \ngraphql \nendpoint um and with graphql \nyou yeah you can make a really specific \nqueries \nand search through your data and \nthese uh yeah because it's completely \napi based this means you can build any \nkind of \nany type of application on top of vvas \nand you can use it \nuh or integrate it with other existing \nplatforms in your data infrastructure \nthen we v8 is cloud native so \n[Music] \nyeah you can use it and run it at any \ntime at any place in \na distributed setting as well and \nyeah this means that also bv8 is easily \nscalable horizontally and you can run it \nuh \nalso in the cloud in production because \nwe offer \nkubernetes clusters for example \nand then yeah as you all know um rev8 is \ncompletely open sourced \nso you can find all the code and how to \nuse it and \nyeah everything is online on github \nwhich makes it \nalso excellent for your own research for \nexample \nand then yeah lastly most use cases what \nwe see right now is \nautomated classification and semantic \nsearch \nbut we also see that people use vvate as \na yeah actual core \ndata infrastructure just to to store the \ndata in \nin factors instead of in a traditional \nway \nbecause it's really scalable and um yeah \nit has also high \nuh query performance \nso i will now go over one uh but the \ncharacteristics one by one \nto explain them in more detail \nuh yeah so first about this built-in \nmachine learning model and \nyeah factorization in general so \nwhat is affected search engine actually \nso \nfactor search is sometimes also called \nsimilarity search or neural search \nand yeah what can you do with this \nso imagine you have a big pile of data \nlet's say one terabyte in this case \nwhich can be \nfrom multiple sources and could be \nunstructured \nand there's probably a lot of \ninformation in there \nbut it's hard to get it out there so \nquestions that you could think of \nyou can ask this kind of data is um how \nmuch \nmoney did we actually spend on traveling \npost covet 19 \nor maybe you're thinking where can i \nfind publications related to machine \nlearning \nand you know as a user of your own data \nthat \nthe the answer to these data to these \nquestions \nis somewhere in this database um \nbut you don't know how to get it because \nthere are several problems here \nso first of all the set of data so \none terabyte of data is really really \nlarge so how are you going to find the \nanswers efficiently \nor you can just iterate through a \nterabyte of data \num yeah unless you're okay with response \ntimes of \nor 15 seconds or so but in industry \ncases \nthis is usually way too long we want an \nanswer right away \num yeah it needs to be near real time \nso that that's the first problem with \ntraditional search engines \nuh trying to find answers to questions \nlike this \nand then the second problem is that \nyeah that as i mentioned before in this \npile of data \nmost of your data is probably \nunstructured \nand so if you think of a sql or sql \ndatabase \nwith all fields defined these kind of \nquestions might work \nbut if your data is unstructured and \ncomes from multiple sources you don't \nknow \nwhat you're really looking for so you \ndon't know what kind of tables or what \nkind of \nsearch terms you're really looking for \nand then the real problem um \nyeah is actually a third problem and \nthat's where \nthat's how how should you deal with uh \nfuzzy text based search so now we're \nasking \nthis database um a human yeah or natural \nlanguage question \nso how much money did we spend on \ntraveling post code with 19. \num so yeah what are what results are \nlinked to this question \nmaybe some of your data only mentions a \ntrain ticket or \nan airline travel ticket \nbut doesn't have the exact words of \ntraveling in there \nand with traditional keyword based \nsearch you won't be all you'll be able \nto find all the data related to \ntraveling \num yeah but so still a lot of companies \nwhat we see \nis that they do this manually they need \nto tag every \ninvoice or every traveling invoice \nmanually to find \nanswers to questions like this and this \nis yeah of course \nnot super efficient but with a vector \nsearch \nengine like we've ate uh we can rely on \nmachine learning instead to \nautomatically \nlike tag or find answers to to questions \nlike this \nand yeah similar we can \nthink of the the second question so \nfinding publications related to machine \nlearning so \nif your publication literally mentions \nmachine learning \nit might be it might be easy to find it \nbut what if you have publications that \nare about \nartificial intelligence or um \nyeah or nothing no words like these are \nused at all but just \ntechniques like unsupervised clustering \nor tools like tensorflow a string based \ntraditional search engine won't be able \nto \nfind these publications if you're \nlooking for machine learning \nbut if you look with effective search \nengine then \nit automatically knows that tensorflow \nis related to machine learning \nand then um yeah if this question is \nyeah this problem is solved the third \nproblem \nwith the first research then we yeah it \nalso comes \nwith another problem actually and that's \nhow um \nyeah how to do this most efficiently in \nreal time \nespecially so if you want to have a \nproduction \nquality search engine where you need to \nhave near real-time answers to your \nquestions \nthen yeah this is hard to solve and \nyou might be familiar with yes some \nlibraries that \nthat solve these kind of factor \nsimilarity searches uh for you \nbut this differs from review because uh \nthese libraries \nfirst of all they take a lot of memory \nand they leave all the dealing with \nfailures and crashes up to the user \nbut vv8 is not a simple library like \nthis \nand instead it's production focused and \noptimized \nfor for real search \nso now let's take a look at what \nfactorization actually is and how it \nworks within vva \nso yeah factorization it's also called \nmaybe uh word \nembeddings or mapping from words to \nvectors \nor some other search terms and what it \nessentially is \nit's a mapping of words or concepts to \nvectors and vectors are an array of \nnumbers or coordinates basically \nof real numbers and vectors in this case \nare represented in the high dimensional \nspace \nwhich captures the meaning of those \nwords and concepts \nso and with what's unique to alleviate \nis that \nnot only words and concepts are \ntranslated to factors but also \nwhole data objects and that's what makes \nit a database \nand the factor mapping that happens with \na \npre-trained model we trained a language \nmodel \nor based on 20 languages actually \nand used that within vv8 but you can \nalso add your own \nlanguage model to your specific domain \nif you want \nso let me give you an example \nso as i mentioned yeah vectors are \nmapped to a high dimensional space \nin our case this will be 300 dimensions \nin which all the words and concepts with \nalso the data objects are placed \nin using coordinates and their \ncoordinates or \nthe vectors they are calculated based on \nthe meaning \nand the relation to yeah to other words \num yeah here i have a three-dimensional \nspace \nfor simplification because i think none \nof us can \ncan think of 300 dimensions \nand what you see here is \nthe pre-trained language model uh within \nan empty review so there is this is just \nuh \nan empty viviate there's no data objects \nadded by a user yet \nno data in the database it's just a \nrepresentation of the pre-trained \nlanguage model and this language model \nwe need later \nto give the context and the meaning and \nlike the smart feature to your data \nso here are the pink dots you can see as \nwords and concepts from the pre-trained \nlanguage model \nwhich is as i said now available or \nalmost available in \n20 languages and \nwords and concept concepts like this are \nplaced in this vector space according to \ntheir meaning which is derived from \nthe context in a in a big training set \nso and the distances between those \ncoordinates \nuh yeah you can think of um yeah of a \ndifference in meaning \nbasically so for example fashion \nis really close to sweater because they \nthey are conceptually really close \nbut they lie far away from concepts like \nmachine learning and ai because they \nthey don't share a lot of meaning but \nmachine learning and ai \nare in turn very close to each other \nso and as i said this is just a \npre-trained vector space \nbut there's no actual data of the user \nin there so \nyeah how does we view that then \nuh here's an example so let's say we \nwant to add \na data object we have a database of \npapers research papers and we want we \nwant to add \na new paper about machine learning \nopportunities for healthcare \nso if we want to store this data object \num \nit vva takes on runtime \nall the words that are defined in your \ndata object \nso in here we say we have a paper \nwe have a title so machining \nopportunities for healthcare \nmaybe it has a summary with more words \nand maybe it has some references \nto other objects and and also here it's \npublished in a publication \na demo preview it does in runtime \nis take all the words and \num yeah make basically one large \nsentence from them \nand then it uses the pre-trained \nlanguage model \nand it creates distances between all \nthose words in the space \nand it weighs all the words based on uh \nyeah \namongst others the occurrence in the \ntraining set to determine the final \nmeaning of the whole data concept so as \nyou could imagine that \nmachine learning and healthcare are way \nmore important in determining the \nmeaning \nof this concept then has an in because \nthey \nthey don't say anything about the \nmeaning \nso based on all that information a \nnew vector space is for a new vector \nor yeah coordinates is calculated \nwhich is then placed inside we've ate \n[Music] \nand yeah we added here a paper about \nmachine learning in healthcare \nso maybe this this object is placed in \nthe middle of \nthese three concepts and now if we \nquery for something fuzzy like \na paper around ai or healthcare \nthen it yeah it ends up also in the same \nspace and it will return this paper \nthat's how vivian knows what's to send \nwhat what to send back to \nuh to the user on uh query time \nso a little bit more about yeah the \ntechnical effects \nso yeah this pre-trained language model \num that we provide \nwith vvate is pre-trained by us using \nfastnext and fastex is a \nlibrary made by facebook uh for \num yeah training language and \nfactorizing language \nuh and words um yeah based on their \nalgorithm \nso yeah we call this um or we call \nour own text to factory to fact model \nthe contactionary because it gives \nreally the context \nto the language and it enables putting \nyour own data into context \nuh to its language um \nand we just released a pre-trained \ntext-to-effect model which was trained \nby fastex \nand the previous language models were \ntrained to \nuh using glove um which is um \nyeah another library but then from \nstanford university \num but we found that fast x performs way \nbetter in clef \nclassification and in exploratory \ntesting \nand in addition fast text appears to \nperform \nway better than than glove with \nuh significantly significantly less \ntraining data \num which means that 100 gigabytes of \ntraining data with \num yeah of common crawl \nwith fast x performs better than one \nthousand with cloth so that's a huge \nimprovement for us \nand um yeah but false text \nis a little bit different from glove \nbecause it represents each \nword as an engram of characters instead \nof learning the whole vectors \nuh for words directly so in theory this \nthis helps us \ncapturing the meaning of shorter words \nand allows also \nthe embeddings to understand suffixes \nand prefixes \nand this also allows us to work with \nreally rare words \nthat weren't seen during training but \nonly edit \nat user runtime \nwhich is of course really good for user \nexperience \nand at the moment you can use vvate \nwith this pre-trained language model \nwhich is uh \nyeah sufficient to work with a great \nvariety of use cases \nand in january uh 2021 we are releasing \nthe yeah version one of wv8 in which \nwe also allow uh custom factorization \nmodels \nand this means that that you can also \nuse \nother trained language models with vvate \nan example is bird \nwe've experimented a bit with bird and \nwe see that \nworks works really well if you have \nreally long documents \na really long text and \nyeah or you can imagine other \nfactorization models like \num for specifically for question \nanswering \nor maybe image factorization uh or dna \nsequences and so on \ndepending on your use case \num yeah so that's it for the \nvectorization \nso then a bit more about the graph like \nstructure and \nthe api \nso yeah as i mentioned we v8 stores data \nas vectors and yeah in a high \ndimensional space \nbut it's still possible to connect those \ndata objects \nit doesn't have this \nit's not a graph database it's a factor \nnative database but it's still possible \nto make these graph connections \nand um yeah this is a just a small \nexample so \nif we have a paper and it belongs to a \ncategory \nwe can link this paper with this \ncategory \nand in a query this will look like this \nso i will go into detail \nuh to queries later but here we have a \npaper and we're looking for a paper \nrelated to machine learning \nand i want to return the title so no \nrelations here \nbut now if we also want to know to which \ncategory \na paper belongs \nwe can also ask for this in the query \nso we map these relations if we add \nthe data and we can create them back \nso i can show you this in real time also \nso here i have a \ndata set of 1.7 million articles of \narcsave loaded in arcsiff is \nyeah a service for yeah 1.7 million \npapers in the stem field \nand we have loaded them in and i have \ncaptured the paper itself with the \nabstract \nand some other um yeah attributes \nuh their authors in which journal they \nappear in the category \nand now if i want to query it using \ngraphql it will look something like this \nso i can make i can ask what kind of \ndata we have in there \num here i can see \nwhat to ask for so let's see what kind \nof papers we have \nand just our title for now and then we \nsee \nif i press enter we see at the right \nhand uh the titles of the papers \nthen i can also of course ask for more \ninformation \nso for example the abstract uh \n[Music] \nyeah let's ask for this i get back to \nthe whole abstract \nbut this of course is just some random \nquerying any database can do this \nand now if i want to show the semantic \nfeatures \ni can make a filter \nwhich is called the explorer filter \n[Music] \nand i can define some concepts that i'm \nlooking for \nso this is also what you saw on one \nslide earlier \nbut let's say i'm looking for papers \nrelated to machine learning \ni type it in here and i want just the \ntitle back \nthen \nnow i see um yeah the results which are \nsorted \nbased on how relevant they are \nwith my search query and i see here \nmachine teaching a new paradigm for \nbuilding machine learning systems \nsecond one is also something with \nmachine learning \nyeah and so on and we can make all these \nseries uh way more complicated and so on \nbut i will leave this \nthis out for now and then as i showed \nyou before \nit is we can show the graph \nyeah graph like uh data model \nalso let's look at the \nthe categories to which it belongs \nso you can do this like this \nand i just want to see the name of the \ncategory for now \nso now i see the same results so this is \nthe same first \num uh \n[Music] \nyeah paper about machine learning and i \nsee all the categories it belongs to \nso that is in real short uh \nhow it works \num yeah then we have \nyeah as i said it's cloud native it's \nopen source so you can find all the code \nuh on github and it will always remain \nopen source as well \nand yeah what we see mostly now is that \nit's used for automatic classification \nand semantic search \nand we have now defined \nthe most common use cases we see so we \nhave \num enterprise search we have uh \nclassifications \nin erp systems erp systems our \nenterprise research resource planning \nsystems \nin which classifications are usually \ndone manually at the moment \nbut this is not necessary if you use \nreviate and then we are also \ninvestigating \nwhere you can help in cyber security in \nbiology with \nfor example dnac sequences or protein \nsequences for example \nand more and then of course there's \na great potential also for future use \ncases \nwhere we don't maybe rely only on text \nbut also in images or videos \nyeah and so on \num then a little bit about uh \nmore yeah also the technical side why \nwhy we v8 yeah and the benefits over \nalternatives \nso earlier we answered the questions why \nfactorization \nand why this is better than \nyeah not factorizing or traditional \nsearch engines \nwell yeah the answer to this was that \nfactorization \nbased on the trained factorized \nfactorization model like the \ncontextionary \nwill automatically add context and \nmeaning to your data \nand which enables then yeah the smart or \nsemantic search and automatic \nclassification \nnow as i said before there are existing \nfactorization \nlibraries available also open source so \nwhat's now then so unique about vv8 \nso yeah pure factor similarity or \nnearest neighbor libraries are super \ngreat and they can also have high \nperformance \nbut these libraries as the name suggests \nthey're just simple libraries \nand they're no end-to-end solution so \nyou have to take care of your own data \nstorage \nuh you have to take pain to care maybe \nalso your own \nactual factorization they use a lot of \nmemory \nand they leave the yeah dealing with \npotential errors or failures \nto the user which is uh not very \nintuitive \nand yeah hard to to to grasp also \nso vp8 is not a simple library \nbut it's a yeah really focused on \nproduction use cases and it's a \nhighly optimized search engine in \nproduction \nso yeah that's first of all then \nas i said before the factor uh search \nengine \num rev8 is factor native so \nit's not only factor capable but it's \nalso optimized to handle \nand deal with and store factors so we \nhave a vector index \nuh part of the core and with this vector \nindex we \nit is capable of handling very very \nlarge data sets \nespecially if you also horizontally \nscale your your own data instances \nand we're using a state-of-the-art \nfactor indexing technique from research \nwhich is called \nhnsw and this is yeah the first \nindex type we support but in the near \nfuture we will support more types \nand these will be plugable so depending \non your use case you can \nuse different types of uh of indexing \nand yeah a little bit about h sw so it \nstands \nfor hierarchical inevitable small world \nand this is a algorithm or a technique \nwhich is optimized for nearest neighbor \nsearch and which is fully graph based \nso in short when you're looking \nor querying some data objects or factors \nand you want to know the most similar \nother factor \nfactors or data objects in your database \ninstead of storing the whole like all \ndata objects \nof your data and searching through all \nof them what happens with \nhnsw is that it search searches only \nthrough \na small part that it has stored in its \nmemory \nso it's using very little memory instead \nof the whole data set \nand when it finds yeah in this small set \nof data \none point that is close to your search \nquery it will only browse \nto other data objects that are close to \nthat one \nso um yeah it's highly optimized instead \nof \nsearching through all the data and it \nwill still find of course the \nthe data object that is most similar to \nyour \nsearch query so nothing will be left out \nand yeah this makes it super fast and \nefficient \nand actually what makes rev8 really \nunique \nover other libraries or other search \ntechniques is that it combines a \ntraditional way of \nyeah inverted index based search \nwith vector similarity search so you can \ndo both \nfuzzy search but also still the keyword \nbase search \ncombined in a really efficient manner \nand then yeah finally so \na bit short about v8 for ai research so \nas i said \npreview failed is open source so this \nmakes it really great for resource \nresearch because you can just use it \nwhen and wherever you want \nit is highly scalable so if you have \nvery large \ndata sets it's yeah it's optimized \nespecially for that so that's perfect uh \nit has a high performance \nbased um on the focus on industry \nbut this of course is really good for \nresearch research as well if you want to \nhave a \nreally fast query time and then \nfor ai research in particular \nwe can talk about factorization models \nthat \nyou can experiment with yourself so as i \nmentioned \nwe now have our own pre-trained \nfactorization model \nwhich you can already extend by transfer \nlearning \nif you have yeah a limited set of \nabbreviations or some domain specific \nwords you want to \nadd to this contextionary \nand this works really well on like a \nlarge variety of domain use cases \nbut if you want to add maybe like \nbiological sequences \nor images or this bird model and there \nare way more \nmore models available open source as \nwell then \nyou can plug this in yourself from the \nversion we will release in \njanuary so that's really great to \nexperiment with your own machine \nlearning models \nso if you are for example \nyeah experimenting with new language \nmodels new \nnatural processing uh models \nwhat you want you don't want to care \nabout are you sorry you don't want to \nworry about the scalability or the \nperformance you can use vp8 in the \nbackground \nand use your own natural language \nprocessing models \non top of it \num yeah that's uh the presentation that \ni want to share \num so yeah thanks for \nfor coming and i hope um \nalthough it was uh way more technical \nthan usual \ni hope you understand uh what it is and \nof course i'm happy also to explain the \nnot so technical stuff and how it can be \nused in industry or in your use cases if \nyou're not \ninterested in the research and in the ai \nstuff itself \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Vector Database @NeurIPS 2020",
