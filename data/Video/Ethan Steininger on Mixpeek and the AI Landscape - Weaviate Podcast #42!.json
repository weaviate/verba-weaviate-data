{"text": "Thank you so much for watching the 42nd episode of the Weaviate Podcast! Ethan Steininger is the founder of Mixpeek, ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching another episode of the wevia \npodcast I'm super excited to welcome \nEthan steininger uh Ethan is a prolific \nentrepreneur who's created a mixed Peak \nand Kali and he's really got our \nattention to someone who's building cool \nthings with weeviate and generally in \nthe uh search and AI space master of \nsoftware engineering so Ethan thank you \nso much for joining the podcast \nI definitely don't know about master but \nI appreciate the enthusiastic intro \nawesome uh so maybe to then could you \ndive into your kind of background in \nsoftware engineering and search maybe \nyeah maybe search is more the master \nyeah I'm actually only recently uh \nimmersed in the search ecosystem but I \nguess that doesn't act as too much of a \ndetractor considering the industry has \nchanged so much in the last year alone \nuh so my background is actually as a \nsoftware engineer went to school for \nprogramming actually started a lot of \nprojects a lot of startups most if not \nall of them have failed uh so I've got \nmy own if you've ever seen the killed by \nGoogle website I've got my own graveyard \nof projects and GitHub repos Etc that \nI've abandoned so no shortage of failed \nprojects but uh my foray in the search \nwas actually at my most recent job which \nwas at mongodb uh they made the decision \nto actually embed leucine which is like \nthe core for those unfamiliar with \nlucian's the core open source library \nthat powers elasticsearch solar and a \nton of other search engines out there \nand mongodb decided to kind of embed \nthat open source Library within the \ndatabase and coupled it together and \nbecause that's such a novel concept at \nthe time they needed a special SWAT team \nto help take that product to Market and \nso that's what I was summoned to do \nwhich was really just a matter of \ndefining the the customer profile \nbuilding out technical collateral \ntalking to customers and being that kind \nof liaison to the product who's actually \nI won't mention his name but he's one of \nthe formal advisors of of weevier uh and \nactually one of my old-time mentors when \nI first got into search \nbut that's kind of how I first got into \nuh the industry just being summoned to \nsupport the go to market of mongodb \nsearch product \nthat's so interesting yeah learning \nabout uh well I guess I'm kind of \ncurious about this like leucine mongodb \nmaybe I'm very like I don't know if it's \nthe most entertaining podcast topic but \nI am very curious like like what are \nthese Technologies kind of like um \nis it too because I know so little about \nthis kind of world I've like kind of I \njoined wevie coming from like the Deep \nlearning background of being very \ninterested in just kind of \nrepresentation learning optimized \nvectors and then sort of and then so \nfrom there I came into like \nelasticsearch Lucy and solar hearing \nabout these things so I would even maybe \ntalking a little more about like what is \nthe underlying technology of and \nsolar and these kind of things yeah I \nlove the fact that you take most things \nfrom a research angle like that the how \ndoes it work uh which is something that \nI need to get better at but I've \nhistorically tried to figure out like \nthe the positioning of the product and \nlike what kind of immediate business \npain is does it solve I was in I was a \nsales engineer at mongodb uh but under \nthe hood it's really actually quite \nsimple I mean every database has a \nchange stream API uh my sequel \nDynamo they all have some kind of \nlistener that you can open up up like a \ncursor on the database so anytime \nthere's a change you get alerted of that \nchange and so the Architects behind that \nmongodb search \narchitecture they basically coupled the \nchain stream cursor API which listens in \non changes and replicated all of those \nchanges into a leucine inverted index \nand so once you have those two data \nstructures together then they basically \ncreated a a wrapper on top that exposes \nif it's called the aggregation pipeline \nin mongodb it's kind of like the \nquerying language they expose this \naggregation \nstage that allowed you to run a search \nquery on the leucine inverted index and \nthen once you have the results of that \nsearch query it would actually pipe it \nback into the mongodb database which \nwould allow you to do uh kind of you \nhave the term hybrid search that's \nhybrid if you had like database queries \nuh but I know you guys have hybrid as in \nlike TF IDF plus Vector search so uh \nit's a little bit of a different \npositioning where customers that really \nvalue the acid compliant properties of a \ndatabase and want to combine that with \nthe uh with the full text search \nfunctionality \nyeah that's so interesting and I I think \nI was really curious uh you've written \nthis great article on the ml stack where \nyou have the acid compliant thing and \nthen we get and I was like Olivier has \nthe database stuff too I was like do you \nnot agree like I'm curious like is there \nsomething to the acid support in um \n that's left out of weave yet yeah \nI wouldn't say there's anything left out \nbut I as someone that has sold to \nEnterprise customers for a long time \ncustomers are reluctant to change their \nsystem of record right and so like when \npeople are already using a or even \nan Oracle and they're using that as \ntheir source of Truth their their \ndatabase it's a lot easier to tack on an \nexisting search engine and have that \njust be coupled together via some kind \nof streaming technology rather than just \nreplacing it all together so I I'm sure \nthat the the weeviate database API set \nand methods are are super robust to just \nthinking about it from customer \nstandpoint unless you're a startup and \nyou're just doing something new for the \nfirst time they typically have big \ncustomers typically have a lot of uh \nLegacy code data stores in Old database \nEtc but it's a good question \nyeah that's interesting and I I'm kind \nof coming back to something else you \nsaid earlier about the mongodb aggregate \nuh pipeline uh Sebastian would Alexa \nalso former uh and and now Olivier \nhe showed me like this kind of aggregate \nthing in the uh like thinking about the \nvva pipe design and all these different \nfilters that can be attached to ev8 I \nthink it's so interesting like the yeah \njust all these kind of things you can do \nto it so maybe pivoting topics um can \nyou tell me about kind of the founding \nVision behind mixed Peak and and the \nproblem you're tackling yeah one of the \nmost common problems that I had \nexperienced so I I was traveling the \nworld talking to our most challenging \ncustomers when I was at and one of \nthe themes that I had learned about \npretty much every week if not every day \nwas really that of how do we search the \ncontents of files and most of the use \ncase was really PDF files just because \nthese were mostly Enterprise customers \nEnterprise uh companies have a ton of \nPDFs spreadsheets even like doc files \ndocument files uh and so I was just \nbasically telling them all to hey like \nyou got to create this framework and \nthis architecture and you're using Tikka \nand you're extracting the Tikka contents \ninto your search engine you're doing \nchunking and all these things and it got \nto the point where it's like all right \nthis is a big enough pain I've seen this \nenough and the vector search uh projects \nwere becoming more and more popular uh \nand this was right around when Lucine I \nforget which version it was but it's \nwhen they first introduced the vector k \nn uh capability into uh the the core \nleucine branch \nand uh that really unlocked a lot of \nsuper interesting opportunities and uh \ndecided to to quit and build that \nout full time and then I'm very grateful \nto have raised the seed round from some \ninvestors and that's given me a little \nbit of a cushion to explore some of \nthese really radically changing areas uh \nI've I've been talking to a lot of \nstartup I live in New York and I've been \ntalking to a lot of startup Founders \naround the New York City area about like \nhow has your road map really changed in \nthe last three four months and every \nsingle one of them is like yeah \ndrastically we've pivoted so \nsignificantly to keep up with all these \nchanges and like open ai's plug-in \nMarketplace was just announced yesterday \nand you best believe at least thousands \nof startups are going to be considered \nmoot because they've just built wrappers \non top of the Chach EBT API so we're \ndefinitely about to experience an apple \nto App Store like uh paradigm shift and \nuh I'm super impressed that we V8 I saw \nBob's post we V8 is on the the plug-in \nMarketplace you guys are well positioned \nto be that default Vector search engine \nthat wraps on top of Chach EBT right out \nof the box so uh but yeah that was kind \nof like the intro to why I started to \ndevelop mix Peak and at its core it's \nreally just a multimodal indexing \nembedding and search API so we take all \nthe messiness around the database the uh \nkeyword search the vector search the \nfile parsers the file extraction and \nfinally the search and we just exposed \nit as two API calls with re-ranking \nchunking analytics \nEtc all baked in \nyeah amazing that I think there's a few \nthings on that I think I'd like to come \nback to the uh chat gbt plug-in because \nthat's such an interesting topic but \nfirst I really want to just kind of pick \nyour brain more about the mixed Peak uh \ngoals and so so on this idea of and I \nalso think maybe we could talk about \nKali as well this like really nice user \ninterface for getting like dropping PDFs \nin and then it's in the vector database \nin the chat gbt thing like all this kind \nof ranking all that is like accessible \num so I I'm so curious about this kind \nof data ingestion like kind of I think \nthe PDF ingestion with like I I recent \ncalled it OCR on the podcast with Dennis \nyou from mem and he said no it's it's so \npowerful that you can't call it OCR like \nthe way that gbt4 he said it's like \nhaving a human looking at your PDF but \nshortly these things will just make it \nsuper easy to get PDFs into you know \nVector databases and stuff like that and \nyeah all that so I'm curious kind of \nlike how do you see this these uh \nInnovations and maybe like this llm \nenabled ETL for unstructured data kind \nof as well as this kind of chunking idea \nlike what are some of the opportunities \nmaybe around chunking \nyeah uh I think one of the most \nimpressive use cases that I saw for gpt4 \nuh by the way uh there was a paper that \nwas just released by Microsoft research \nI believe two days ago the 22nd today's \nthe 24th all about hey we think that \nchat gbt4 is demonstrating a spark of of \nartificial general intelligence and in \nthat paper they used a couple of use \ncase examples one of which was like you \nsaid somebody provided a picture and it \nnot only described the picture but it \nextracted the contents from it obviously \nwell beyond OCR it's like a human is \ninterpreting it uh and that again that \nhelps us kind of position what we think \nis the most valuable and at its core I \nmean this is my theory on like a lot of \nstartups are having existential crises \nright now uh \nand like chat gbt is rendering a lot of \nthem Moot and so what I'm what I'm \ntelling anybody that's asking is like \nyou need to get closer to the business \nand you need to understand what their \npains are and build phenomenal user \nexperiences on top of that right and so \nif you think about who your user is for \nme I'm building an API so my user \nexperience is the developer experience \nand if I can really nail that developer \nexperience and make it as sticky as \npossible that's my mode that's my \ncompetitive mode \nand I advise the same thing for anybody \nelse because like in the end of the day \nand this is what I've always told people \nthat challenged when we were positioning \nmongodb's Atlas search in the end of the \nday any engineer can build anything \nreally at its core I mean maybe it won't \nbe as good it won't be as robust it \nwon't have high availabilities service \nlevel uh slas uh but they could build it \nit's just a matter of like hey do they \nwant to and B is it as intuitive and \nclean as you could so definitely a \ncouple of existential threats there but \nas long as you're getting close to the \nbusiness and understanding the pain then \nyou're in a good spot \nyeah it's so interesting I really like \nkind of the story that's emerging in our \npodcast so far of like this kind of like \ncustomer success oriented sales engineer \nthing and how that leads you to think \nabout how the perspective that creates \nwhen you're building this kind of \nstartup in the space and yeah so \ninteresting maybe kind of staying on \nthis topic of moot existential crises we \ncould come back to the chat gbt uh \nretrieval plug-in um it's yeah it's so \ninteresting this kind of like uh the \nmarketplace for chat gbt being like \nhosted on the UI because we saw so much \nwe saw so much like building around the \nAPI like uh like Lang chain llama index \nof the two things that I've been super \ninvested in learning is like these you \nknow building these kind of appendages \naround chat gbt rather than kind of the \nChad gbt UI like hosts the apps and yeah \nI'm just curious what your perspective \nlike I think it's such a fun like \nemerging topic is is like is this going \nto be the App Store kind of or like \nbecause yeah or would it be like the API \nlike just how do you see the that kind \nof space \nyeah I'd I'd wonder and obviously \neverybody's just like conjecturing right \nnow but there's really two Avenues I \nthink it could take it's really either \ngoing to be a zap here like experience \nwhere you could just combine all these \nthings together I can use chat EBT to be \nthe link between \nI don't know my Roku with my Alexa and \nmy thermostat right where catch EBT is \nthe link between them all where the kind \nof adhesive the glue is my human \nlanguage do this than that whatever \nthat's one area and the other is really \njust like a standard marketplace where \nyou can procure services from within the \nchat gbt like interface I saw a couple \nof examples where people were booking \nflights from within Chach EBT so that \ncould be that single point interface for \nall of the apps within the marketplace \nit's probably more so going to be the \nsecond rather than the first because the \nfirst I mean there's really not much \nmoat around just being a glue between \neverything but the first is really like \nif this is your default entry point for \ngetting anything done accessing the \ninternet your calendar your trips then \nthat's it's remarkable \nyeah wow that is I mean um \nuh yeah it's like the the business model \nthe mo is super fascinating like the um \nobviously they make like I think it's \nlike 20 a month is the cost for this UI \nright like to even access the app store \nbecause it's only can is it is that a \ncorrect understanding firstly that it's \nonly the paid version that has this \nPlug-In or I'm not sure about that but I \nam a very proud gpt4 subscriber so I'll \nfind out soon yeah I'm subscribing as \nwell \nit's funny I feel like uh no offense to \nanyone that works at Google but the last \ntime I've Googled it I'm a I'm coding \nall day the last time I've used stack \nOverflow is like weeks ago it's \nexclusively been chat EBT which is \nreally demonstrating a significant \nparadigm shift \nyeah I've also been just why I also am \nso excited to check out uh copilot X I \nhaven't yet uh like spun it up yet but I \nmean the the ability of it to write code \nis amazing like my kind of story with \nthis is that you know we've yet it's \nwritten in golang and I don't really \nknow golang but I can like be with the \nhelp of Chad gbt it's just making the \nlearning curve like so much quicker like \nI you know if I say hey I need you to \nsort this list like I have this \ndictionary I have these keys I don't \neven need to know about like the map \ninterfa the map thing of golang it'll \nwrite it for me and then once I see it \nnow I can quickly adapt so that's I \nremember there was this paper from \nFacebook that came out like three years \nago is like translating between \nJavaScript and python I was like wow \nthat's so ambitious but yeah now it's \nlike I think \nyeah what I would love to talk more \nabout get your perspective on how you \nsee how uh gbt4 helps your coding \nproductivity because for me that kind of \nhelped me learn a new language has been \njust the biggest one yeah well before I \nanswer that question I think that there \nis a big opportunity around using this \nlarge language model and really others I \nmean we shouldn't only focus on chat gbt \nlike open AI is doing really well uh the \nopen source models are super exciting I \nknow that uh llama Stanford's llama is \nis generating a lot of hype just because \nit's smaller it's more lightweight it \ncan run with on less CPUs and it's open \nsource so uh just well there's there's \nother options out there uh but at its \ncore like what I've been doing is I mean \nchat EBT for any use case in the uh \nwe'll call it content creation so code \ncopy whatever it it really just serves \nas like providing a framework for most \nthings it's never really producing a \nfinal copy maybe for like a one-line \nemail it will but for code I mean no \none's just dropping it right into their \ncode and deploy into production like if \nthat happens then we've got things Glory \nnow but I think we're a far ways from \nthat uh let Famous Last Words obviously \noh yeah so I think the like the Llama \nalpaca thing one thing about that that's \nso interesting to me is kind of like the \nlicensing of it like with llama it it \ndoesn't have a commercial license like \nyou it's like I think it's like just for \nresearch purposes so like the L packets \nlike you can use it for your phone but \nyou can't like just use it and I think \nthat is another interesting thing like \nopen AI they have this thing where \nthey're saying um you can't use the \nmodel to develop models that compete \nwith openai so obviously like the \nknowledge distillation thing is like you \ncould just copy the outputs basically \nand take any model so yeah that whole \nthing around like what you can use the \nmodels for is so interesting \nyeah uh I wouldn't be surprised if there \nis going to be need to be a like \nprecedence uh shift around licensing for \nsome of these code bases these models \nbecause like I'm sure that there is some \nuh \nfinagling around the legal definition of \nLicensing when you've really trained a \nmodel on the entire closed Source \ndatabase of GitHub uh so I I wonder if \nthere's going to need if anybody is a \npolicy maker out there that's a \nconversation that probably should be had \nsooner rather than later because like is \nit is it really fair to have that uh \nline item in your legal statement where \nyou've kind of done something different \nI don't know uh but alpacas the way \nalpaca was trained is really really \nfascinating I mean they really just \nstarted with this open source library or \nthis open source model called llama \nwhich I think was like seven billion \nparameters they started with that open \nsource model and then they basically so \nwhenever you uh whenever you fine-tune a \nuh we'll call it like these cheap gbt \nmodels you provide prompt completion \nPairs and what Stanford did is they \nactually used chat EBT to generate \nprompt completion chairs and they uh \nPairs and they actually created a \nfeedback loop of uh positive versus \nnegative rejecting versus accepting \nthese prompt completion Pairs and fed \nthat into llama and I guess that margin \nof new new pairs has got it to the level \nof really competing with the GPT uh \nmaybe not four but maybe the three uh \nwhich is which is super valuable like \nimagine the the example that I always \ngive is really like imagine these large \nlanguage models at the edge right if we \nhave an llm on our phone or even like \nsome off-grid device \nit's able to of it's able to consume any \nkind of input and generate an output \nagnostic of its connectivity to the \ninternet and using all the data that \nit's connecting it's kind of training on \nthe fly at the edge in real time it's \nit's really a lot faster so that could \nbe like another convergence of the two \nFields is like this Ai and iot \num it's the really first time I've \nthought about that I don't know what \nmore use cases beyond what I just made \nup are if anybody has any of them feel \nfree to share yeah the the iot thing is \njust it's super interesting I I don't \nknow if this is productive to mention \nbut I like I I took a little grad class \nin graduate school class in like um in \nthe in the Internet of Things it was \nabout like monitoring buildings and how \nyou like send a pulse in one part of \nlike construction like you know building \nand construction and networks and \nthey're like okay the building is okay \nright and thinking about like I don't \nknow could language models in that be be \nproductive or something like the \nInternet of Things topic has always been \ninteresting that I've known a little bit \nabout not too much but anyway so \npivoting to the first thing you said \nabout how alpaca was trained in this \nkind of reinforcing learning from Human \nfeedback thing \num I think I'm thinking a lot about like \nas impressive as Chad GBC is what if I \nfind like what if I fine-tuned it and \nlabeled it on the prompt completions \nthat I like like you said like I think a \nlot about this like like I've had a lot \nof conversations with like Jonathan \nFranco at mosaic ML and their \nperspective on uh businesses wanting \ntheir own custom language models I've \nalso talked to Nathan Lambert about uh \nhugging faces reinforcing learning from \nHuman feedback and like surge Ai and all \nthese things like how this might emerge \nbecause I think about like let's say I \ntrained a language model on like the \nweeviate slack like and then I start \nlabeling its Generations I feel like \nthat's just going to give me something \nbetter than Chachi BC yeah yeah and and \nthat's a really interesting point and \nthe exact direction that I'm taking with \nmix Peak which is around like domain \nspecific data sets right so I mean what \nI'm finding and really everybody's \nfinding is like exactly right I mean \nit's nice that chat gbt understands the \ninternet but maybe the reason why the \nrevenue model isn't quite sound yet is \nbecause they're just hoping that Conor \nand Ethan pay 20 a month which they \nhappily do but the real the real money \nwill always be in the B2B market and not \nonly the B2B Market the Enterprise \nmarket and so there's a ton of companies \nout there including me including \nincluding mixed Peaks that are really \ntrying to understand a company's \nEnterprise uh let's say knowledge base \nand training models maybe they'll call \nthem agents trading these agents around \nunderstanding that data and then \nproviding some kind of chat gbt like \ninterface on top \nuh there's so many sources of \ninformation there's slack there's jira \nthere's uh email inboxes Wiki like these \ncompanies have so many different \nsegments of uh of knowledge and they're \nall really like very well formatted Like \nFor Better or Worse their q a like slack \nsomeone asks a question I'm sure in the \nweeviate slash Channel there's an answer \nand that's a very obvious \nprompt completion pair that can be sent \nto a gbt model so to answer your \nquestion I think that there's really \ngoing to be a strong push towards uh \ntowards customizing models but what I'm \nalso really interested in is like where \nwe V8 comes in is like you guys have a \nsearch engine and the search engine will \nalways be the source of Truth and I was \nactually on one of Bob's uh Twitter \nspaces I forget it was somebody from \ncohere as well and I asked the question \nhey like what do you guys think about \nhow generative models and AI how does \nthat contend with the search landscape \nand a lot of I mean my initial thought \nwould be like it's replacing search \nobviously because you can create \ninformation rather than retrieve but \nafter hearing Bob's great explanation \nand doing a bit of research there will \nalways be the need for kind of like \nreferencing the source of how it came to \nthis conclusion \nuh in perplexity AI has a great UI for \nthat I'm quite fond of theirs and I'm \nmodeling uh the interface that we're \nbuilding on top of uh Kali around that \nthat interface which is really like \nand I'm not I propose this like open \nsource framework for kind of creating \nthe verified truth of generative uh \nresponses and it it really involves this \nsearch engine you embed an entire Corpus \nof content then you you chunk it so that \neach one has its own meaningful \nimportance like modular meaningful \nindependent importance and you embed \neach one and so then you run alleviate \nquery across those entire embeddings you \nget the ones that are most important or \nmaybe the top K most important and then \nyou feed that into a chat EBT and so \nthen Chachi BT has a little bit of \ncontext and it understands that little \nbit of information that can then be used \nto either create a summary or an answer \nor something so that's how I'm seeing a \nlot of people combine the search plus \nthe generative and I see that as being a \npretty standard frame framework for \ncreating these things and I just wrote \nan article that was like here are all \nthe steps that that need to happen to do \nthat because I've built this internally \nfor we could talk about Kali which is \nlike a really simple user experience for \nembedding search on your application but \nlike I've seen and built this framework \nenough where it probably makes sense \nwhere someone uh standardizes it so if \nanyone's interested in collaborating on \nthat happy happy to talk \nyeah super cool and um oh yeah I love \nthat topic I think kind of \none thing about that that I still think \nis so exciting was kind of like the \nfirst thing is like right now the \ngeneral how do you take the context and \nput it into the language model is like \nyou just put it in the input like the \ninput is like you know please answer the \nquestion based on documents documents \nyou know go for it whereas there is the \nscience is looking at these models like \nuh deepmind had a model called retro \nthere's like these fusion and decoder \nlayers there's this uh memorizing \nTransformers where you would uh to keep \nthe embeddings keep the vector \nembeddings and then you say you like put \nthat in layer 9 out of 12 of the \nlanguage model and so this has really \ninteresting scaling properties because \nuh you can you know the way that you can \nkind of like transpose the matrix \nmultiplication you could put like pretty \nmassive uh documents into these models \nand attend over more context so I think \nthat's an incredibly exciting part of \nthis is that I don't think we've seen \nyet the full power of these retrieval \naugmented language models and what they \ncan do when they can take in re really \nmassive context and then yeah as you \nmentioned I read your article as well \nand I've obviously I mentioned earlier \nI've been studying like Lang chain and \nllama index and all this kind of \nthinking of like okay how exactly are we \ngoing to organize the um you know the \nsearch results to present it to the \nlanguage model is such an interesting \ntopic um yeah maybe we could talk a bit \nabout this idea that the Llama index \nidea like there's one thing that I \nreally like about this integration where \nit's like you retrieve a hundred results \nfrom wevier \nand then you need to like extract \nstructure from those results before \nhanding it to the language model and the \nlanguage model kind of use the language \nmodel is what's used to extract the \nstructure as well so it's if it's like \nyou want to turn the top 100 results \ninto a Knowledge Graph you're using the \nlanguage model to go like what kind of \nlike relational triples are in this and \nit parses it out and then you have this \nnew thing that then goes into the input \nto like another language model \nso kind of like yeah I'm just curious \nyour thoughts generally on like how \nexactly do you hand the search results \nto the language model and how much \nopportunity is there maybe for more \ninnovation in that \nyeah uh it's a good question I haven't \nactually explored the exact use case \nthat you just had I love the idea of \ninstructing the creation of a Knowledge \nGraph uh and actually that artificial \ngeneral intelligence paper by market by \nMicrosoft's research team actually \nshowcase like \nthey instructed Chach EBT to ask a \nsequence of questions to understand \nsomething I don't I forget what it was I \nthink it was like the interior of a \nhouse and it demonstrated the creation \nof a mental map of that house that was \naccurate like a visual diagram of how \nthat house is laid out from just asking \nquestions so uh I I'm constantly finding \nmyself not only a maze but like uh I'm \nfinding myself like asking like why \naren't I just using chat EBT to uh like \neven like an ETL an extract transfer \nload kind of uh \nactivity they're they're very suitable \nfor that I think the challenge that I \nhave with like even feeding I think you \nsaid like 100 or so items like \nyou're gonna fast come up to the uh the \ntoken limit for Chad EBT \nand I'd be curious from your standpoint \nis that a something that you see going \naway and B I mean this is the first I've \nheard about like the layering of llms \nwhich really would solve a lot of those \ntoken uh upper bound issues because if \nyou can just like \nI I don't know enough about to even like \nexplain that but uh seems like that \nwould address a lot of the the the \nchallenges with like feeding your entire \nCorpus in one point to the the Chachi BT \nAPI right \nyeah I mean I'm just fascinating on this \ntopic this has been kind of the number \none thing in my mind lately is like \nthese like text to SQL is kind of the \nstarting idea where the language model \nis like writing an SQL query to get \ninformation out of the database but I \nthink we're thinking about like okay how \ndo we do this with weaviate how do we \nget the language model to use the \nsymbolic filters so it's like if I let's \nsay I have the weviate code bases like \nthe thing that's too many tokens to just \nput it all in there at once so we need \nto like cleverly search through it and \nwe have these kind of symbolic filters \nof like the um like the folder structure \nI think is a really good one for these \nyou know big code repositories you know \nyou have like modules is here like repos \nadapters these kind of things and it's \nlike how do you tell the language model \nhow do you prior it like um a prompto \nsorry prior how do you prompt it to say \num you know you have these categories \nthat you can filter your search through \nso like do you only want to look through \nlike you know this particular folder of \nthe project structure I yeah that kind \nof thing of like um \ngetting the language models to use the \ndatabase interfaces so are you saying \nthat the repository the the weeviate \ncode base repo is an ancillary to the \nquerying language and by understanding \nthe relationships between the folders \nand directories they can they being the \nGPT whatever it can then understand how \nthese manifest into the queries \nthat yeah that idea is the one that I \nthink is um yeah yeah \nI think that I feel sick too \nit's like the um because it's uh this \nGeneral thing is on it on any code base \nright yeah I think that that linking \nthat that does imply that your software \narchitecture is like really well mapped \naround like the methods that you expose \nin the query language too like you said \nthe modules the \nuh I don't know enough about you said it \nwas written in Rust \nyeah yeah exactly this because all these \ncode bases have this kind of and that's \nlike the thing is like the structure is \nlike um like we're talking with Dennis \nabout mem and these like you know like \nworkspaces where you create a workspace \nlike I don't know like you have some \nchapter of your molecular biology class \nand you're like and then you keep like \nyou create a page and then you add \ncontent and like there's like this \nstructure as well and I think this \nstructure is really well captured and \nlike weeviate has the symbolic \nproperties as well as the vector search \nand then the filtered Vector search is \nlike made crazy fast like this bitmap \nindex thing of like these intense like \nfiltered uh disk and is a paper that \njust came out another like exciting idea \nof how you integrate those two things \nbut yeah it is just such an interesting \ntopic um so maybe there's something I \nreally want to come back to with the \nmixed Peak and the uh specific problems \nthing is and then we touched on it \nalready with this idea of how alpaca was \nfine tune with like a different data set \nof reinforced learning from Human \nfeedback but how are you thinking about \nfine tuning I always I ask everyone \nabout this topic because I love it okay \nso I'm gonna caveat everything which is \nby saying that like I I have a team of \nreally brilliant Engineers that I'm \nworking with and they're the ones that \nare really creating like I'm kind of \ncreating the uh the little bit of an \nabstraction layer on top of like think \nof it as you have core services and then \nyou have like routers on top of those \ncore Services uh the really impressive \nteam of Engineers is building like the \ncore embedding inference and uh \nre-ranking and fine-tuning models but I \nthink we actually talked about this at \nthe weeviate Meetup Connor which is like \nhow or maybe it was your colleague but I \nwas I was asking like what are some of \nthe like really suitable production use \ncases of learn to rank right and I know \nlearn to rank isn't quite fine-tuning I \nthink there's probably a little bit of a \nNuance but uh I think that like \nre-ranking results around the previous \nsequence of some kind of uh \nsignal that a user has and reordering it \nbased off of some kind of conversion \nmetric that's that's exciting but I \nthink at its core again it goes back to \nunderstanding the end user so like for \nexample I'm exploring with this Kali use \ncase which is it's really like an \nembedded search bar on any website it's \njust like a JavaScript widget that you \ncan embed on your site that understands \nall the files and the directory of the \nfiles and I think if if we're able to \nkind of track the activity of a user \nacross a number of pages uh we can \ncreate kind of analogies between hey \nthis sequence of activities which user a \nconverted and converted is just a metric \nthat is specific to this company so \nmaybe if it's an e-commerce company they \nbought a chair or if it's a weeviate uh \ncompany they deployed some kind of \ninstance so everybody has their own \nmetric that they use to define in \nconversion and so if we can build a \nlearn to rank model that is actually \nreordering the results based off the \npropensity to convert then I think \nthat's really attaching ourselves to the \ngoal of the business \nuh but I realize that's a little bit \ndifferent than fine-tuning \nuh well yeah no I I think there is a \nrelationship but uh yeah we'll come back \nto particularly like what kind of fun \nthing but yeah learning to rank I love \nthis topic uh yesterday I record a \npodcast with um Erica from leviate and \nRoman and Siva from meta Rank and so oh \nyeah great people right yeah and so this \nkind of idea of uh you know using like \nan XG boost style model that takes in \nlike user features as you mentioned like \nthe um there's like the interaction \nevent obviously like I think people are \naware of this kind of like you know you \npeople they collect click data about you \nand like when you like except \nyeah so so this kind of layer it I mean \nI guess um I think I at this kind of \nlearning to rank thing I think I'm very \ncurious about like the generalization of \nIt kind of like the like because you're \nusing all these features and I I wonder \nif that's going to be as kind of robust \nas like the content only based cross \nencoders and then I one idea I think is \nextremely interesting is maybe taking \nthese tabular features and just kind of \ntranslating them to text and just making \nit a text based input and then you know \nthen you can access the transfer \nlearning kind of part of it where \nthat's what I think is kind of the \nfrontier of learning to rank per and I \nyeah I was I think um \nlet me just make sure I understand that \nsaid differently we have user a that \ngoes and clicks a button on the first \npage and then Scrolls down to the second \npage and then clicks another button on \nthe third page that's three different \nsteps that can be mapped to text unique \ntext and then that sequence let's say \nit's an array of strings gets sent to a \nlarge language model or whatever and \nthen the embedding is generated stored \nin a search engine and then you can run \nlike sequential inference \nis that kind of maybe not yeah yeah \nthat's well you you yeah like the \nbecause you kind of confused me a bit \nlike in changing my understanding with \nhow you're describing like the scroll \ndown the interaction because I I suppose \nyou could collect a crazy amount of \ntabular features that might be too much \nto translate into text but then I also \nthink if you're collecting that many \nfeatures you're going to overfit to some \npattern in this feature Vector that \nyou've done like you know scroll down \nfor three seconds waited for two seconds \nhovered over this for five seconds right \nlike I feel like if that kind of vector \nthat kind of feature engineering is \ngoing to overfit but yeah no that's \nexactly it is like um you translate it \nall into text and then like I think \nabout um if I had some kind of user \ndescription like usually cross encoder \nis like query document but like if it \nwas like query user description document \nyou know I don't see why that wouldn't \nwork just as well and then also you used \na large language model to do that kind \nof reasoning and then you distill it \ninto like the 20 million parameter cross \nencoder that runs crazy fast and \nand then the the topic then I think is \num you know they'll need to be like \nsoftware \nlayers to make that kind of thing \naccessible right like um training \nranking model that's what I really \nthought that meta ranked podcast was \ngreat because I I really like what \nthey're doing how they've built the like \nml Ops just for ranking I think it's a \npretty cool Niche like uh yeah because \nyou have all the how do they do it if \nyou were to summarize in like \na paragraph \nwell as I can say like coming from the \nbeginning of it my interest with \nintegrating this to weviate was like \nweevia has this module system where you \naccess the retrieval from you know like \nvector search Hybrid search with the \nsymbolic filters and then you can pipe \nthat into like a question answering \nmodel and so we could also pipe that \ninto these uh ranking models and so it's \nlike if if we can just make that API to \nThe Meta rank services so metal rank \ndoes the full set of like the you know \ninference hosting the model like the you \nknow how you do the data ingestion how \nyou do the model versioning the \nvalidation that is like quite a package \nof ml Ops things and yeah \nyeah I uh while I was actually at \nI was trying to do my best on educating \nthe entire Solutions architect org which \nwas like 400 people at the time around \nVector search and from interviewing all \nof the companies that were exploring it \nwhat you just described were the biggest \npains around it which was like okay how \ndo we do model versioning where do we \nhost the models how do feedback loops \nwork uh what's like the best reference \narchitecture for the ml Ops to to handle \nall of this \nuh what I'm finding is like I'm forced \nto store model versions as like a string \nand some kind of other uh data store and \nthen create an index for all of those \ndifferent model versions because as you \nknow if we just tune a model even \nslightly it kind of renders all the \nembeddings Obsolete and that poses an \nentirely new challenge which is okay how \ndo you kind of refresh all of the \nexisting embeddings and I've seen some \npeople have some pretty impressed \ndistributed compute uh workloads they're \nusing spark to just run everything in \nlike this horizontally compute fashion \nsome people are using like serverless \ngpus to do that uh but yeah I mean it's \nit's a huge Challenge and this is why \nlike if if anybody's exploring starting \na company in the AI space it's tooling \nis hot uh just because of like no one \nknows how to productionize some of these \nuh applications and like I'm sure \nweeviate is doing phenomenally for that \nreason uh but like all these ml Ops and \neven what we're working on which is \nthese API based companies to help \nabstract a lot of these complexities \nthere's there's a lot of interest in \nthat uh both from the market and from \ninvestors so \nuh you did ask a question earlier Connor \nwhich was like \nis there going to be a winner take all \nfor these models I'm curious to hear \nwhat your opinion is because like \neveryone's it's so obvious right now \nthat open AI is like absolutely \ndominating but like is is that really \nthe future uh are we just gonna all be \nsuccumb to the whims of Microsoft \num okay well I think um it's a it's a \nsuper interesting question I \nI think uh \num \nyeah I mean well it it's I could see it \nbeing kind of Monopoly like in the sense \nthat well this kind of like zero shot \nthing to me is very monopolistic like \nthis you know like the whisper model \nthat it goes audio to text similar to \ngbt4 this AG like I think AGI is pretty \nlike I don't I don't think that you'll \nbe like oh I didn't like the answer from \ngbt4 let me go ask coher or let me go \nask Bard right this kind of thing like \nwhere you go ask another one of the agis \nlike I think it's more likely that \nyou'll just tune your prompt kind of if \nyou're unhappy with the answer but I do \nthink like I don't I don't know I'm not \nsure I'm not I haven't really thought \nabout this too much but I \num and it's such an interesting topic I \nwish I had a more like a more thought \nthrough yeah all right sorry to put you \non the spot I know you guys we've yet \nhas a lot of partnership with the \ndifferent uh modeling companies and I've \nI've used most of most of them cohere uh \nhugging face I've I've used like so many \nof the llms out there uh but yeah I I \nthink personally there's probably \nthere's going to need to be some kind of \nlike staggering of the offerings and we \ntalked about how like the companies that \nare offering these like domain specific \nmodels and they're like supporting the \ntraining on companies knowledge bases \nthey're going to do really well but then \nthere's this entire uh arm of companies \nthat really need security uh I went to a \nsecurity meet up yesterday uh a company \nin my our lead investors portfolio and \nthey like what we talked about earlier \nthey've completely pivoted their roadmap \nto support how do we create what did \nthey what did he call it like zero \nknowledge proofs around uh like what \nyou're providing to the model and \nensuring that you can validate that the \nmodel is \nactually I don't want to butcher it uh \nbut it's an area of academic rigor and \nlike \nthe lowest hanging fruit is really the \nmodels that you can self-host \nand if that's never a direction that \nChachi BT goes in which could unlock a \ncan of worms in Pandora's Box because I \nknow there's a lot of filters that \nthey're putting on top \nbut uh I think there's a lot of avenues \ndifferent model companies can go after \nit's like is security the most important \nis domain specific the most important is \nGeneral usage the most important cohere \nhas a phenomenal API API Set uh so so \nmaybe it's just like the developer \nexperience so uh I think there's gonna \nbe there's gonna need to be like \ndifferent niches and maybe open AI does \nbecome the App Store but then like \ncohere becomes the sales force right \nlike there's no sales force on the App \nStore maybe there is nobody uses it but \nlike there's still a behemoth because \nthey attack the domain specific \nknowledge base \nyeah and I like yeah we've had a lot of \nPartners and friends and like another \ncompany that you know that I'm super \ninterested in is what Mosaic ml is doing \nand I think as you mentioned the sales \nforce I think Mosaic ml is the like that \nis a company that's just super impressed \nme with their Pro I love like the um \nlike I love this kind of business model \nobviously it's like the Wi-Fi business \nmodel so I like it a lot of like where \nyou kind of Open Source the software but \nthen the like Enterprise hosting is \nmanaged and so you know Mosaic ml they \nthey have this composer Library they're \nsharing all this knowledge on \nregularization and you know they're \nthey're hitting they're cutting the cost \nof training bro I think they just said \nthat they trained Bert for like 20 and \nit's like they're you know they started \nout by saying I can get you GPT 3 at 450 \n000 and now today it's 300 000 and \nthey're you know they're they're cutting \nthis down and I yeah I think it's super \ninteresting that kind of idea of the you \nknow the language model for your custom \nthing but then there's is so so yeah I \nthink actually we could segue this into \ntwo things there's the language model \nfor your custom thing and we talked \nabout the kind of custom re-ranker and \nhow that learning to rank generally uses \nall these crazy specific like tabular \nfeatures about you and then there's the \nembeddings models like like what do you \nthink of and and you mentioned that \nproblem of uh the re-vectorization \nproblem that's a pretty big problem like \nif you update the embeddings and you \nhave a billion embeddings you then need \nto recompute a billion embeddings with \nthe new model right I've seen some \ninteresting but like retrieve the \noriginal corpuses as well which is like \nits own mess of challenges and that's \nwhy these like hybrid search engines are \ngoing to become more and more important \nuh which is like you need the original \ncontent in order to do the re-embedding \nbut sorry I cut you off oh no yeah \nthat's yeah it's great I mean the yeah \nlike vectorizing a billion yeah like \nI've seen a cool idea which is like like \nthe Facebook DPR model like where you \njust update the query embedding model I \nthink that's a potential idea where uh \nthe zero shot embedding happens with the \nlike you know the open AI or cohere \nembeddings model social coheres \nmultilingual embeddings model is amazing \nand you you know that's your document \nembeddings and then you update maybe the \nquery and then yeah another interesting \nthing from that uh cohero Twitter talk \nthat Bob said was that he thinks uh like \n80 of the cases the zero shot model \npaired with the like lexico bm25 and the \nhybrid setup that that's a pretty good \nyou know that's a pretty strong bet okay \nyeah and I this is uh an interesting \ntopic that I've been curious about which \nis like is tfidf and bm25 are they gonna \nbecome obsolete at some point like are \nwe always going to need to do like \nstring matches to some capacity or will \nVector searches kind of just dominate uh \nobviously you guys have an opinion there \nbecause you've baked it into your \nroadmap uh but yeah so so you were \nsaying sorry so the bm25 combination \nwith what has excelled uh this is like a \nzero shot embedding model so you know \nlike the open AI embeddings pairing that \nwith bm25 for let's say looking through \nAir Airline manuals like some you know \nlike some uh application like that uh \nyeah and I I do think BM 25 it's pretty \ninteresting because there is definitely \nsearches like \nI like this idea of having like intent \nand like prompting search as well there \nare a couple papers like task aware \nretrieval with instructions and instruct \nin the instructor models that are like \nyou prompt kind of the embedding model \nas well because the embedding model also \nis like capturing a relationship so it's \nlike a one of the great academic data \nsets is beer and beer has this one data \nset called arguana and in argue Anna \nyou're retrieving counter arguments so \nyou you put in some argument and it's \nnot it doesn't say get me what agrees \nwith this get me what doesn't agree with \nthis and that little difference so like \nthe retrieval models obviously aren't \nlike adapted to that it's it's very \ninteresting because like it's like that \nnegation thing where you say like I am \nhappy I am not happy and then you're \nlike oh why are these vectors similar to \neach other and it's like well there are \nsemantically similar and that's the \nrelationship that's captured so \nsee I might have gotten a rant there for \na bit but I yeah yeah so because beer \nwas trained on and it looks like it's \nb-e-i-r right yeah \nbecause beer was trained on like the \ninverse or the negation of some of these \ncomments they have slightly better \nunderstanding of the use cases where \nlike I am not happy versus I am happy \nwhich is interesting because like as \nsomeone that's experimented with a lot \nof the like hugging face off-the-shelf \nmodels that's something that has \nhistorically been quite challenging to \ngrasp because you could have an entire \nsentence just one word makes that entire \nsentence completely different \nwhich is probably an area of academic \nrigor so task wear retrieval with \ninstructions okay bookmarking that yeah \nyeah it's so fascinating and I think \nkind of one more thing I have strong \nopinions about b or b e i r because I've \nspent so much time working on adding \nthis to ligate but like so the beer is \nlike this zero shot Benchmark it's like \num I think 17 in total but three are \nlike closed source so 14 are like openly \navailable and so you don't do any \ntraining is the idea of it is like how \nwell can a model trained on something \nelse generalized to this and I think \nthat that and that's like that and this \nuh I think like Ms Marco is one of the \ndata sets but it also has a training set \nI don't think we have a good academic \ndata set for the like continual learning \ncase like that like it would be amazing \nif there was like an academic data set \nthat was like let's say the pi torch \ndocumentation and like how it evolves \nover time I I think that kind of data \nset is needed because it you know it's \nlike um like I love this example with \nweaviate where it's like in 1.16 we \nintroduce ref to VEC and it's like model \nwould have no clue what ref to VEC is \nyou know like it's this kind of sequence \nproblem I think \nand by sequence you mean kind of \ncapturing the evolution of a corpus and \nand using the Deltas between these \nstages to tune the model \nuh I mean that's a that's a good point \nof like how exactly do you want to do \nthis I mean I because I just think like \nthe um it's like the kind of like the \ntrain test set is like uh there's \nusually like this IID you know like \nindependent identically distributed \nwhere you you know have all your data \nand you're like randomly sampling the \ntraining set randomly sampling the \ntesting set compared to this like \nhistorical data splitting where it's \nlike you trained on 2012 to 2018 tested \non 2019 2020 and I think that that's \nmore realistic in my view right right \nand I think the use case for that are \nare really aligned with uh just this \nconcept of a knowledge base where the \ncontent itself is evolving and you need \nto kind of \nnot only train but test on like the the \nDeltas of those stages over time \nuh if it's all right with you I'd like \nto Pivot slightly into something that \nmight be a little bit irrelevant to NLP \nwhich is some a little bit of a hot take \nthat I have uh as of late so I've been \ngoing to a lot of these like meetups uh \nin New York I'm pretty new to the city \nuh including the Wii v81 and they often \nhave you put like name tags on and what \nI've been really into doing is just like \nputting some kind of like contentious \nopinion on these name tags and I I think \nthat one of the most important things as \nsomebody that's building and trying to \nexplore and leviates doing a phenomenal \njob at this is building in public and \nreally showcasing not only like the \nfinal released version but all the steps \nthat you got to get there and not only \ndoes it help you build an audience on \nthe way but it really kind of showcases \nthat you're a human and you're a little \nbit vulnerable because you're kind of \nmaybe nervous about the steps that \nyou're exposing but it unlocks so many \ndifferent opportunities around getting \nfeedback at every stage garnering like a \nreally strong evangelist uh user base \nand the the best example of this is \nreally open source right if everybody \ncan see every uh pull request every \ncommit every issue then it's really \nquite obvious how everything is going \nand especially if you're just like a \nsole entrepreneur engineer it's like \neverybody can see hey this is the \nprogress this guy has made on on this \nproduct \nI don't know uh I don't know if you have \nany projects that you've done \nindependent of we V8 in the past but \nlike is that something that you've \nexplored and are are there any companies \nthat are doing that really well \nyeah oh I love this up again well I yeah \nbecause I think about it a bit I think \nlike um \noh it's very interesting it's like this \nquestion about like the business model \nof Open Source kind of in general and \nthen as like as I think open source is \nalso kind of like a Content strategy in \na way like you you you're like Yeah by \nlike constantly doing these releases and \nthen explaining all the details of it \nyou curate an audience and a lot of \nthese products like having a community \nthat's like super valuable because \nespecially if they're making pull \nrequests and things like that like I \nknow like with yeah yeah like I think \nLang chain is a great example of \nsomething that's achieved this like you \nknow people especially with like the \nIntegrations Integrations being such a \nmassive part of this like with other \nsoftware companies and it like so yeah \nlike if you're creating this content and \nthen um that's kind of what I like about \ndoing this podcast as well is it's like \nthe potential to you know have somebody \nwho doesn't necessarily work at weaving \nbut you can kind of like highlight what \nthey're doing and it kind of \nincentivizes everyone to work together \nyeah it's pretty fascinating but I I \nthink some parts of the business I don't \nknow I like I think closed Source \nbecause there has to be some kind of \nAdvantage unless you're like a \nMarketplace business like something \nwhere the community is the mode well the \ncommunity is is often like a really \npowerful Competitive Edge uh I mean as \nsomeone that worked in an open source \na company for a long time I can I can \nsay that but I think the real moat is \naround the abstractions and like \nmanaging an open source project is is \nreally going to be a challenge if you \nespecially if you want to have some kind \nof semblance of high availability and an \nSLA guaranteed to your customers and so \ntherein lies the importance of like \nhaving these servers all managed for you \nand there are some interesting companies \nthat are like really abstracting the \nserver uh \nthe the like server architecture of I'm \nsure Mosaic is doing that to some degree \nuh there's one company I won't give them \na name but uh they are purely just a \ndecorator in Python that says hey Run \nThis and like uh run this as a \nserverless function uh there's a couple \nof companies that are doing that that's \nwhy I didn't want to name anybody but I \nthink that for me at how I'm trying to \nmake myself uh mix be competitive is \nreally just around hey let's do our best \nto abstract a lot of the patterns that \nwe're seeing across these companies and \nfor us it's like everybody is doing \neverybody is probably storing their \nfiles in some kind of content repo like \nan S3 they're all trying to extract the \ncontents they have very strong variants \nof files we want to extract the contents \nin a way that it's maintaining the uh \nthe the structure of the file so for \nexample paragraphs and pages and PDFs \nrows and a spreadsheet we want to \nmaintain that and then offer some kind \nof search interface that spans all of \nthem and all of these are like all these \ndifferent steps and if we were just to \nopen source the entire mix be code based \nand we could probably people could \nprobably do a lot of that but they won't \nget the same experience as just like a \ntwo API call kind of thing and hopefully \nyou guys are doing are exploring that in \nthe same way with weva cloud \nyeah yeah that is really interesting I \nget maybe um I if you could teach me a \nlittle more about the serverless \nthinking we had Eric bernardson on the \npodcast to talk about well I'm thinking \nof modal yeah and uh yeah I saw your \narticle with uh banana as well could you \nkind of explain to me what these \ncompanies are doing okay just \nyeah I mean I I had an idea of like in \nin any industry the companies that kind \nof consolidate all the different steps \ntend to do really well uh and it is kind \nof compounded in the ml space which is \nlike the more data you have the more \nvaluable you are the more like we said \nthe domain specific models to every \ncustomer is is the future uh like what \nMosaic is doing and so uh if you're \nbaking in the ability to spin up and \ninference engine a model in an \narchitecture that is both cheap and fast \nand you're able to do that in a really \nsimple way and expose that to your users \nthen it's it's a really powerful asset \nthat you have in making your competitive \nmode as as a company it's like \nthe analogy that everybody understands \nis like everyone is coming from Google \neveryone's coming from Facebook they \nhave expectations when they interact \nwith your software and that expectation \nis it's fast it's accurate and very \noften it's a lot more affordable uh so \nand that's really why serverless is such \na an interesting space but what's really \nfascinating and this is something that \nafter talking to a bunch of Engineers at \nAWS gcp and Azure is like is that it \ndoesn't seem like any of them are really \nattaching attacking these serverless GPU \nspace I don't know why but like I've \nseen articles I've written articles \naround hey if you want to do like \nserverless gpus then you gotta create an \nelastic Cloud an ECS uh architecture \nthen attach uh whatever the GPU instance \nis and kind of have scaling baked in \nwith maybe like kubernetes and anybody \nthat's used kubernetes knows that it's \nlike the biggest pain \nand so like modal banana they're all \nabstracting the kind of deployment of \nthese models via the serverless gpus and \nI like modals approach which is just a \ndecorator in Python I haven't actually \nused banana but uh yeah Eric's great guy \nyeah that's amazing I I've always been \nso interested in this I mean full like \ndisclaimer I'm like I spend most of my \ntime reading research papers and stuff \nlike I'm just these are just like we're \non the time of edge not an expert on \nthis but like the the thinking of like \nthe kubernetes and the scaling different \nresources for different kind of uh jobs \nlike I was always kind of as a as \nstudying deep learning I was always \nreally curious like how's weights and \nbiases like how are they valued at like \na billion dollars right because it's \nlike a it looks to me like hyper \nparameter logging tuning logging and you \nknow I did like some like marketing work \nwith determined AI where they were also \ndoing this like uh hyper parameter \ncluster thing and so I was like starting \nto learn about this kind of cluster \nmanagement thing and I kind of came to \nthis thinking that like the kind of like \nthe callbacks require different \nresources than the training and so you \nknow having this \nI kind of like with weeviate like where \nyou uh have some resources for the \nweeviate and then you have different \nresources for like say the query \nembedding container like this these \nrequire different kinds of uh computers \nand like all that kind of thing and it's \npretty I mean I I like I really don't \nknow too much about kubernetes but like \nor like what the particular pains are \nbut I that's how I understand the ideas \nlike yeah like serverless to me it \nsounds like if you want to just have a \nquery embedding model on you know \nrunning you just you know write \ndecorator on a python function right and \nthat kind of thing is super cool um yes \nI don't know if I have too many ideas on \nthis but I think it's super interesting \nI mean Leo like what is the big \nkubernetes is a pain problem I've heard \nthis so many times but I don't really \nknow I think it's it's around like \nthere's two there's two aspects to it \none and I'm also not a kubernetes expert \nby any means I've just use it it's it's \nprobably the fact that I'm not an expert \nwhich is like I'm creating a little bit \nof a bias in me complaining about how \nchallenging it is uh which is like a \nkind of uh a weird situation but for me \nit's really like the creation of the \nkubernetes cluster in addition to the \nmaintenance of it and I what what could \nbe and this is my own theory is like \nwhen you have distributed \ninference engines the state is in \nconsistent across them and I'm sure Eric \ncould \nmake some explanation on why uh it's \nlike serverless environments can \novercome that challenge but like if you \nhave an app server and you're \nDistributing the workload across three \ndifferent servers and you're routing the \nquery across one of those three \ndifferent servers how do you guarantee \nthat there is like a state between the \nservers like the perfect example that \neverybody could probably understand is \nthis concept of context with the chat \nEBT so let's imagine we have three \ndifferent serverless functions or one \neven one serverless function and every \ntime a user is calling this decorator it \nis deploying this inference on let's say \nserverless environment a and then \nanother user is doing serverless \nenvironment B how is context shared \nbetween them because they don't there's \nno State it's serverless \nuh I I I'm probably just speaking out of \nmy uh my key stir here because I don't \nknow much about the space but that's an \narea that has always been challenging \nfrom purely I'm an app a software \ndeveloper not a researcher but that's \nalways been an area of challenge with \nlike serverless functions and databases \nis you need some kind of State \nManagement \nyeah amazing I've been learning about \nlike replication consistency from we V8 \nand and it sounds is he related to the \nguy that created the Lampert clock \noh oh no he Nathan hasn't been on the \npodcast yet just a friend of mine I'm \ntalking about uh and I don't know about \nthe clock thing but \num \nyeah the Lampert clock is like the \nfoundation of like distributed systems \nand like consistency oh God you gotcha \nyeah I've just yeah so I definitely \ndidn't like study too much replication \nin school but I'm now listening to \neveryone like Eddie and Parker and red \none and I think just you know being able \nto fly on the wall in these \nconversations but like the um yeah that \nkind of thing of like if I have if I \nneed four gpus to run my chat gbt \ninference I suspect that's like the \nAzure cloud has maybe been built around \nthis in tandem with open AI if I was \nbecause yeah that sounds like a terrible \nproblem I think and I know the companies \nlike Ray that do this kind of like \nuh distributed GPU management it's super \ninteresting I mean I'm more so \ninterested in this company called neural \nmagic that's trying to compress the \nmodels and you know either run them on \nCPUs or they recently got the hunt \nthere's a research paper with one of the \ntwo researchers has the neuromagic \naffiliation that's run it on a single \nGPU the 175 billion parameters and I \nlike quantization sparsity these \nsparsity is like one of these things \nthat hasn't been realized as like the \nlottery ticket hypothesis is like you \ncould train the sparse networks from \nscratch but now there's like a lot of \nlike okay how do we really realize \nsparsity but yeah I'm talking about it \nlike user too like I know I'm thinking \nabout these things too often but I do \nthink this is \nyeah it really sounds like what you're \nsaying is the the future of a lot of \nthese models is you realize just them \nreducing in size but not only size but \nthe ability to run on more so commodity \nHardware because not everybody has other \nthan the Bitcoin miners out there and \nnot everybody has some like really \nsignificant GPU uh setups even in the \ncloud \nyeah yeah that's what I I mean I think \nyou know they got the uh the alpaca \nmodel people are like running that on \ntheir phones so I was like yeah I saw \nRaspberry Pi running it which obviously \nimplies there's no GPU involved at all \nI'm sure it's slow as hell but the fact \nthat they got it running is just a \nmagnificent accomplishment \nyeah yeah and I yeah I mean this \nI guess it's like the the the \nTransformers I think became so popular \nbecause of how it uses this big matrix \nmultiplication thing for gpus but maybe \nnew architectures like there's obviously \nlike this sparse uh mixture of experts \nkind of model and yeah like maybe new \narchitectures that don't that aren't so \nthere's like this great paper from uh \nSarah hooker called the hardware Lottery \nthat's like talks about how much the \nhardware has influenced the architecture \ndecisions and deep learning and these \nkind of things and \nyeah it's definitely not an expert in \nthis space do you think in is there like \nthe idea that the decision to build the \nmodels around these really large matrix \nmultiplication and arithmetic is that \nreally uh was that decided on because of \nGPU popularity you think \nuh or I guess are there other options \nwhen you do machine learning I've only \nknown about just like the linear algebra \num \nwell I think \num \nyeah it's like \nI'm trying to think because I I'm trying \nto think about how the difference in the \ncomputation with like the convolutional \nkernel is compared to the like attention \nMatrix multiplications and I do think \nthat the convolutional kernels are \nimplemented by just kind of like \nreplicating the kernel and then making \nthat also a big Matrix so I'm not yeah \nI'm not exactly sure yeah about \num exactly how the Transformer utilizes \nmore of the GPU than the convolutional \nmodel does or or if that is really the \nargument but I think it's just generally \nthis thing of like \nyou know big Matrix multiplications \nyeah as far as I understand it yeah no I \nmean no I'm definitely not an expert at \nall uh but it is interesting to see like \nthere's only a couple of Hardware \ncompanies out there and they are I mean \nNvidia is basically open AI at this \npoint in terms of their like market \ncapitalization on the ml space so uh \nit'll be interesting to see who else is \ngonna take over in the in the GPU \noffering space and maybe there's other \noptions that aren't gpus who knows I \nwent to a I went to AWS re invent uh \nlast year and there was a talk on \nquantum computer and she like the lady I \nthink it was uh Oxford research company \nshe brings out this like physical \nquantum computer and it's like the size \nof my desk and I maybe that will be \ncapable of some of these uh calculations \nat some point who knows yeah that sounds \nlike a good topic for like a PhD student \nlike yeah \nyeah one other point that I want to \nleave with before we go is like there's \na lot of fud and real fun fear \nuncertainty and doubt there's a lot of \nfud and like I said before like \nexistential \nuh threats and kind of just feeling \npeople feeling generally really \nstruggling with the idea of like these \nmodels taking over and while a lot of it \nmight be true uh should always encourage \nlike \nremove yourself from the situation I \nmean uh I'll tell anybody that wants to \nlisten about this but I lived in a \ncamper van for a year before moving to \nthe city like outfitted a a Ford Transit \nHigh roof with electricals running water \nsatellite bed everything and really just \nlike removed myself for a year and I \nencourage everyone to not do that that's \nobviously pretty extreme but like \noperate in Sprints and uh and coasts so \nlike you could Sprint for a couple of \nmonths but don't forget to coast and \nwhatever coasting is for you like do it \nfor uh uh like a like a fixed amount of \ntime continuously it's not enough to in \nmy mind just take like a weekend trip \nhere or there and I realize not \neverybody has the the benefit of this \nbut it's really helpful especially when \nyou're trying to figure out how to uh \nresurge whatever project that was just \nrendered obsolete by the plug-in \nMarketplace \nbut yeah and if everyone anyone wants to \nsee how to build a van it's \nvanlifecoder.com is a a Blog that I \nmaintain documenting the build out \nprocess and the travels and I'll be \ntaking it again this summer hopefully to \nNorthern Canada \nthat's awesome yeah that's super awesome \nthat's great advice I think um \nyeah it's I I think everyone's felt a \nlittle bit of existential like what is \nthis with the gbt4 I think \nyeah people who are so dismissive of it \nI'm like it's obviously scary like \ntaking over every single job I don't \nthink replacement is the right word but \nlike assets is certainly the right word \nanybody that's not using it is certainly \ngoing to fall behind \nyeah \nit is pretty intense I mean I think a \nlot I think the like the societal issue \nis like will this just cause more \nconcentration of power at the top \nbecause now you're like the top can like \nhas all has even more leverage with just \nthe information uh control yeah yeah I \nthink productivity is probably the best \nmetric to to look at I mean if someone's \nable to produce more in less time then \nthey clearly have an advantage hopefully \nthese models again it's probably still \nin that like open source alpaca llama \nspace once these models do become more \nand more commoditized and democratized \nthen it does even the playing field and \nactually create equal opportunity uh for \nall which is really one of the most \nimportant things with creating like a a \nreally robust Society is like if \neveryone has access to the same Baseline \nuh chat EBT model then I think there \nthere's that even playing field and sure \neveryone's going to have their \nadvantages in some capacity but we \nshould do our best as a society to \nensure that everyone is like \ndoing their best or everyone is exposed \nto the same like Baseline opportunity \nand there's a difference between \nopportunity and outcome uh there will \nalways be people working harder and \nthere will always be people that have a \nlittle bit more of an advantage but if \neveryone has the same Baseline \nopportunity I think that's what we \nshould strive for \nyeah there's a lot of great topics \naround this I think um I've recently \nlistened to Richard satcher was on the \ngradient podcast and he was talking \nabout uh his work with the AI Economist \npaper and this kind of like running \nsimulations to inform policy decisions \nwhere the where the agents in the \nsimulation are reinforcement learning \ncontrolled like to you know make it a \nlittle more realistic of a simulation \nand all these this kind of ideas uh yeah \nit's super interesting I mean I do like \nFrancois Chalet had this interesting \ntweet where he was like uh saying that \nuh oh I'm gonna but I'm gonna do this \nlike crazy but he's saying something \nlike uh thinking that gpt4 is like super \nintelligence is similar to thinking that \nlike a 3D printer is just like arbitrary \nmanipulation of matter that you can just \nlike and I don't know like that kind of \nthing of like how are we like it's scary \nbut is it that far is it like complete \ncontrol of the universe so to say you \nknow like I don't know if it really is \nthat in that productive yet but it seems \nlike it's on the way to it yeah it's \ndefinitely on the way and I think that \nthis plug-in Marketplace some of the use \ncases that I saw on the website are \nreally like oh a phenomenal the paper \nthat I was mentioning by the Microsoft \nresearch team which again is really \nbiased because open AI in Microsoft are \nobviously together uh but they \nanalogized this ability for Chach EBT to \nfigure out problems on its own I Via \nquestions Etc with the time in which \nHomo sapiens discovered their ability to \nuse tools \nso like for example openai or chat gbt \nwas capable of kind of like calling a \nthird party API when it wasn't able to \nfigure something out on its own it's \nclearly demonstrating enough reasoning \nto use a tool to accomplish its goal \nwhich is again that same overlap which \nis \nHomo sapiens discovering how to use a \nknife what fire is so we could be seeing \nlike the dawn of a a new species a \ndigital species uh and maybe there will \nbe that like Evolution uh staging of of \nthis new species who knows \nyeah a lot of sci-fi uh articles around \nit \nuh yeah I mean before we go I do want to \nstay on this little like I've been \nthinking a ton about this idea of how \nwith language models they can have this \nlike role playing like one language \nmodel is the writer the other is the \neditor or say wevier right where we get \nis like a remote company where you know \nfor the most part we interface via \ntexting each other and writing code and \npull requests and like having calls with \npeople outside the company and things \nlike this it's like you could have the \nyou know the core team full of language \nmodels that basically the difference is \nlike what information the language model \nis hooked into so like if you're on the \ncore team I don't know like if I'm \nsampling someone I don't know but like \nyou know people access different \ninformation and I think what we'll see \nis like entire like digital like \ncompanies that are just like language \nmodels with different roles it's kind of \nhow yeah I mean you're saying that there \nmight not even be a single employee at a \ncompany it'll just be all these large \nlanguage models that have their own \npersonas and maybe they're trained on \ntheir specific skill sets you've got a \nlarge language model that is \nspecifically marketing you've got one \nthat specifically sales engineering Etc \nI could see that I did see a tweet I \ndon't know who it was but he basically \nposed a challenge to Chachi BT to turn a \nhundred dollars into two hundred dollars \nand he was like do whatever means \npossible and I think what they amounted \nto was some kind of like affiliate \nmarketing uh project which is like cool \nand all but like what are you gonna do \nwith that so it kind of uh it suggested \na domain name it wrote the website it uh \nreached out to a bunch of Affiliates and \nit kind of built the Analytics \nuh structure so I guess each of these \nthey need to be modular right you need \nto be asking these questions in a little \nbit of a modular fashion and I think \nthis is also something that chat TBT \nstruggles with is like every ask is \nsequential and that's really what chat \nEBT excels in which is like you ask a \nquestion it gives you an answer and you \nask it to tune that answer or replace it \nor whatever \nthat sequence is how we all think but \nwhat if it could uh kind of go way back \ninto some other state and this is again \nlike that statefulness if it could go \nback into another state and uh resume \nsome kind of context there and this is \nprobably where the layers of large \nlanguage models comes into play and even \nthese are like the concepts of Agents \nmaybe you have a version that's doing X \nand A version that's doing Y where \nVersion Y has access to the context of \nuh I don't know some other agent \nuh this is interesting I don't know this \nis the first time I'm thinking about \nthis but there's there's so many \ndifferent opportunities this is a gold \nrush certainly yeah it definitely is and \nI really liked your article about the \ncontent verification layers because I've \nbeen thinking a lot also about like you \ncan sample many different decoding \nPathways it's like you're saying with \nthe stateful thing like you know it's \nokay you know it's thinking and then it \ngets to this node and then you have like \nthis like I think temperature is now \nlike just if I say temperature people \nwill understand that you can adjust the \ntemperature to get different more random \nmore deterministic outputs from the \nlanguage model but really the way it \nworks is there's like this probability \ntree that it's decoding through and you \ncould take many pathways through that \ntree to get several different \ngenerations and yeah I mean yeah that is \nlike because the thinking with the \ncontent verification layers is like you \nsample all these outputs and then you \njust kind of like filter it that way \nlike obviously the most of the filters I \nthink are right now like more like guard \nrails of like whoa don't say that like \nthat kind of thing whereas I feel like \nif it's like writing code maybe a \nclassifier could classify if this would \ncompile or not or not even a classifier \nmaybe I don't like I don't I don't know \nif that's a great example because like \nobviously you could like compile it but \nlike this kind of thing of like sampling \nanyway so I do think I've gotten totally \noff topic uh Ethan thank you so much for \njoining the weba podcast I mean we \ncovered so many topics that like really \nchallenged my thinking and a lot of \nthese different things and I hope I \ndidn't say anything too stupid \nbut yeah no I mean you could always \ncensor it after post-production but no \nthis is great Connor uh always \ninterested in talking to people in the \nspace and uh if anybody wants to reach \nout I mean I'm happy to talk uh building \nout this this project this startup doing \nit in public there's mixpeak.com then \nthere's kali.ai and I am uh Ethan \nsteininger on anything I mean I'm pretty \ngoogleable or I guess chat gbt maybe I \nshould check if \nperplexity.ai definitely does I'd \nencourage anyone to search their name in \nthere it's really cool yeah \nyeah it's super quiet the perplexity \nthing I mean I think yeah just the whole \nlike kind of the new era of like you.com \nNeva these like just brand new ways of \nthinking about search yeah yeah yeah \nthat's really cool cool \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Ethan Steininger on Mixpeek and the AI Landscape - Weaviate Podcast #42!", "path": "", "link":
