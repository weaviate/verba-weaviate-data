{"text": "A step-by-step guideline on how to do this yourself using Orchest, Weaviate, and Streamlit. \n[Music] hi everyone my name is rick and maybe you've heard in the podcast about this example that i would like to share it's a pipeline that fetches data by scraping comments off of a form on the internet then inserts it into a vector database called weaviate which is open source just like orcist and it then allows you to query set database using a python based streamlet application if none of these words mean anything to you i'll go step by step to explain to you what it's all about but basically it's about making content searchable in a semantic way so semantic search doesn't just do a one-to-one mapping of text queries to text content but it actually tries to assign conceptual meaning to such two paragraphs and words of text and it will try to match your query with the underlying meaning to find the relevant content even if it's formulated in an entirely different way than in the text query of your search and so what you're seeing on the screen is the orcis user interface this is a pipeline developed in orchest and it's really just simply two steps two notebooks that get executed and it's really about fetching the data from a website and then injecting that into a database so i'm gonna switch to jupyterlab to show you the code it's actually quite short and simple so this code is responsible for fetching the web page and that contains the html that we're parsing that contains the comments it also tries to capture the date stamp so we have a little bit of metadata about this comment and it just fetches it uh all of it and it really uh structures it in a very simple json-like dictionary that then gets passed to the next step so this is like the only orcas related line of code in this entire notebook that's how we pass data and make it available to any step that gets connected to it so in this pipeline you can see that there's this this connection and this connection basically allows you to get access to the data in the next step so in the next step this insert weaviate notebook we're basically able to get access to those comments and use the built-in python client of we vv8 to be able to uh ingest like it's basically loading data into a database and because they've written they've written this really nice nice python client it's very easy to actually add this data into bb8 you can see how simple the code is it's just uh i don't know 10 cells that even do a little bit of stuff you don't really need to do like printing the client and it just deletes existing objects so we start with uh from a clean slate fetches the comments using this orches get inputs function uh from the previous step in the pipeline and then injects it into the the database and so if we um take a look at the final piece of code that's part of this project which is the streamlet application it basically uses a connection to the wev8 database to allow you to then query using this simple uh structure that is also part of their python sdk so it's like all python in this project should be fairly simple to follow source code and the end result is that we can for a given user i've i've added my own user id it fetches the the comments injects it into eva and then makes it available as a python application so let me um show you what it's like to use this streamlet application you can enter a query so i can search for uh like a hard disk and it will actually find this comment even though i talk about hdds which then we v8 knows is this actual concept of a hard drive and and in fact we've eat supports multiple languages and so because this is a dutch website i've created uh this example using a dutch language model so having ability to do semantic search in non-native languages to english i think is really cool because it allows you to search content in all kinds of languages and so i can search for dutch words like house and it will actually talk about one of my questions i asked about moving to to a city and so i think this example really shows you how you can use orcas to piece together three interesting concepts which is like web scraping of comments that are on the public internet then injecting that into a semantic search database like we v8 and then using a simple application like uh streamlet to be able to gener generate a simple ui that allows you to actually uh take advantage of the content or the database that you've created so i would um recommend everybody to check it out on github i'll link it below it contains the full repository with all of the information including the readme and yeah i think i i hope this was an interesting example that you can use to get started with either we v8 or orcist it has a open and orcis button in the repository that you can use to spin up the example on orcas cloud we have this free tier that you can use um so leave any comments if you have questions we really like seeing people engaged with the content we put out so yeah this this was it for my end and hope it was somewhat interesting [Music] ", "type": "Video", "name":
