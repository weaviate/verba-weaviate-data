{"text": "Jupyter notebook for the cursor API: ... \nforeign \n[Music] \nI have the whole crew in here we've got \nErica I got done we have Zen we've got \nConnor we've got me uh well Sebastian \nyou can see the neck well this way see \nthe name here and we are super excited \nfor this Vivid air episode which is \ngoing to be focused on yesterday's \nrelease of vv8 118 and you may have \nalready cut a glimpse of the release \nblog post and read about it in the \ndocumentation but I thought the idea of \nthis episode could be can we maybe \ndiscuss some of those features and \nexplain them or maybe we could demo some \nof those features you know just in case \nif you didn't quite figure out yet how \nto use them we can maybe show some of \nthose in action \nso we are super happy to see you here \nand thank you very much for watching and \nlistening and if you like this content \ngive us a like because that always helps \nmaybe more people like-minded like you \nand us can come and watch us so this \nwill be super super exciting and the \nbonus of being here live like always is \nyou can ask questions as we go so um you \ncan ask questions oh you know like if \nyou don't have a question just say hi \nsay where you're watching us from or you \nknow just say you know some random fact \nyou know just keep it more or less on \nthe topic and we are all going to be \nfine so the main topic today like I \nmentioned is we did 118 and we have a \nbunch of really cool things that we want \nto talk to you about so first we'll talk \nabout cursor API so Dan will be covering \nthat and I believe that as a a nice \nlittle demo that goes over it then Conor \nwill be talking to you about want and we \nshould probably have a whole discussions \naround it Erica will be in charge of \ntalking about like the new stuff around \nbm25 and hybrid you know the wear filter \nand the stop words \num then we'll talk about the addition to \nhnsw PQ and then we'll cover like an \nupdate to replication with tunable \nconsistency and Repair on read we'll go \ninto roaring bitmaps and then finish off \nwith the addition to our backups for \nazure \nso without any further Ado let's start \nwith the cursor API done the floor is \nyours \nthank you Sebastian hi everyone my name \nis Dan Das kalisco I'm a developer \nadvocate.pv8 \nand let me introduce you to the cursor \nAPI which we launched with version 118. \nthe main reason for this is that private \n118 you could only retrieve about 10K \nobjects from a database which meant you \ncouldn't really use it as a source of \ntruth but with version 118 we released \nthe cursor API which lets you paginate \nthrough all objects in the database in a \nclass so you can use Vivid as your \nprimary database \nand the way this works is that we have \nan after parameter which is based on \nuuids and it works for both the rest and \nthe graphql apis \nyou pass an ID to that parameter and \nwith yet will retrieve objects that \nfollow that ID in insertion order \nso that means this API Works only for \nretrieving objects but not for searching \nor filters \nto demonstrate this I use the Vivid demo \ndata set python package \nwhich was also published recently by my \ncolleague JP \nand it has a number of data sets \nincluding Jeopardy questions which I \nimported into a sandbox \nso we have the console here \nand are going to demonstrate the graphql \ncursor API \nso we're getting Jeopardy question \nobject \nthat starts after the empty string which \nmeans we need to return the first \nobjects object it has \nand we also request the ID among the \nother fields and this ID will help us \nresume getting the objects effectively \ndoing pagination \nso you can notice that we have a limit \nof three objects \nand this is the second one \nso if I'm going to copy this ID and \npaste it here then rerun the query we \nexpect UV to return objects after this \none so starting with the last object \nthen it almost hearty as the answer and \nwe'll see two more objects from the \nJeopardy question class so let's see if \nthat's what's going to happen \nand that in happened as predicted so \nthis is the graphql usage of the cursor \nAPI \nand here we have a jupyter notebook that \nshows how we can use it for the rest API \nas well \nand the code is um simply a while loop \nin which we call the objects API with \nthis after parameter \nand again it starts with MP string then \nwe fetch the idea of the last object \nthat was returned and repeat the loop \nand there is a setting here interval set \n100s every 100 objects to display some \nprogress \nand you can see that um \nuh the client retrieved 100 objects in \nabout 0.6 seconds this is way slower \nthan typical because it's a sandbox \nand it eventually finished with reading \nall objects \nand um graphql functions in a similar \nway so we have this query in which we \ninterpolate the after parameter \nand we pass it \nvia post request to the V1 graphical \nendpoint \nagain pick up after from the last \nreturned object and repeat the loop \nand graphql retrieved all the objects \neven faster than the rest API about \ntwice as fast \nso this was the cursor API and you can \nread more about it in our 118 release \nnotes \nright here \nperfect this was uh pretty cool and done \nso basically what was the idea of this \nlike so \num with the cursor API is the idea to be \nable to go through all of the data like \nin a really fast manner without like \nwriting complicated queries or what's \nthe what's the idea \nand the main idea is that now you are \nable to access all objects in a class \nwell previously you are limited to 10 \nobjects for a query so users had to \ncraft these artificial wear filters to \nkeep patient 84 objects but now you \nsimply indicate the last the ID of the \nlast object you received in the after \nparameter and you get the next limit \nobjects so that lets you dump all \nobjects in database or use it as your \nprimary source of Truth \nnice nice this this is cool yeah and um \ndefinitely like looks like a super \nefficient way to like access a huge \namount of data because I I remember in \nthe past like if you just wanted like \ntest out few objects this wasn't as fast \nso yeah even like on the on a Sandbox \nenvironment uh like the speeds were \npretty impressive \nthis is very fast because there's no \nfiltering you simply fetch objects in \nbatteries \nnice nice so and then is the idea of the \ncursor API that because you have this \nafter you almost like go like here's my \npointer start from here and kind of like \nfly in that direction is that where it \ncomes up \nyeah yeah that was my question is um \nfrom the uids how are they sorted so \nwhen you go from after it takes you to \nwhere are they like in order of how they \ngot into the database like it's after it \ntakes you from this uuid how how are \nthey sorted \nso they are in the order in which they \nwere uh inserted in with gate in the \norder of creation interesting yeah \nthat's pretty cool \nnice so I guess like even as the as you \nquery the data and you modify the data \nyour cursor kind of stays consistent in \none place while if you are running like \nspecific queries suddenly the next page \nwould have could have changed right if \nsomething underneath changed yes because \nthere's some ideas which are immutable \nthe order of objects returned by uh this \ncourse or API is guaranteed \nnice nice \nyeah I love it I love it yeah thanks for \nthe demo this this made it pretty uh \npretty uh to the point and then and and \nnow I know how to use it like uh I can't \nwait to um like I I I almost said that I \ncan't wait for this episode to end but \nlike I've this this is definitely going \nto be something I'm going to test out \nafter we go offline so um yeah thanks a \nlot for the demo done and um Conor \ntell us about once should I show your \nscreen as well yeah cool is it showing \nnow \nit is I got the uh because I have this \ngoing full screen so I can't see \neveryone else anymore all right so I'm \ngoing to be talking about wand scoring \nand there used to be this meme on \nTwitter that was like making gpus go \nbird and talk about like running \nsoftware fast and so I had to borrow \nthat for talking about like something \nthat makes something faster hey so is \nthat that's like a bird like like a fast \ncar or a burger I'm cold \nI guess it's like the sound of the \nmachine like you imagine this like \nright like a pairing cut machine that's \nokay I get that nice all right so the \ntldr of this is is with with bm25 we're \nscoring each of these keyword terms and \nyou only really need to score the unique \nterms to most of these queries so that's \nthe tldr is you know if the query is how \nto catch an Alaskan pollock you probably \nonly need to score Alaskan pollock you \ndon't need to score how to you know and \nthese kind of things so \nso let's dive into the details of how \nyou calculate the bm25 scores and uh so \nif you see my mouse like K1 and B these \nare just like constants like constant \nvalues that are used to kind of \nstabilize the algorithm you might tune \nthem but let's kind of ignore that uh so \nthe key things to look at here are so \nthis is the score of a document in the \nquery is you Loop through the terms in \nthe query and then you have the IDF for \nthat query term the Q sub I and then you \nknow the frequency of the query term in \nthis document you know normalized by the \nsame score and then by the um the length \nof the document divided by the average \nlength of all your documents and then \nyou also have this IDF thing this IDF \nthing is the most important thing well \nlet's just quickly explain why it is the \nmost important thing so with with this \nother part of the equation when you're \ndoing the uh the frequency for the query \nin this given document \nthis the key thing here is going to be \nthis document length and the average \ndocument length so what that looks like \nis let's imagine like one of our \ndocuments is just pawlik it's just one \nword this is like the most extreme case \nwhere you're kind of like gaming that \ncardinality of D thing so you end up \nwith one over 50 and so you know pawlik \nappears one so it's one over one plus \none over fifty and so again we're going \nto ignore these constants just to get \nthe key ideas behind like what changes \nfor each query \nso you end up with 1 over 1 plus 150 \nWhich is less than one so you're always \ngoing to have some value that's less \nthan one and thus the IDF is really \nwhere the payload comes in because you \nknow you're only getting at most just \none which is going to be the same as the \nIDF from this part of the bm25 \ncalculation \nall right so the interesting thing is \nthe IDF so the key things in IDF are n \nthe total number of documents you have \nand then end of the query term which is \nhow many times this term appears uh in \nthis um \nuh overall in all of the documents so as \nsome examples let's say like you know \njust we have 20 documents and you know \nhow appears and so this is like the \ninverted index you have how to catch n \nand these are the document IDs that like \nthat where it appears like just \nnumerically so you know to sum it up how \nappears eight times two twelve catch \nfour and ten and then Alaskan only twice \nand Pollock only twice so when you plug \nthat into the you know n minus how many \ntimes it appears over how many times it \nappears you end up getting like for the \nrare terms 20 minus two over two is nine \nwhereas for the common terms like two \nyou get like 20 minus 12 over 12 which \nis two-thirds so this is these this is \nthe IDF of each of these terms how much \ncan it possibly contribute to the vm25 \nscore so once you've been scoring this \nquery how to catch an Alaskan pollock \nyou have a minimum threshold so you \nscore pawlik it adds nine you know to to \nthe the documents that had pawlik \nAlaskan then adds another nine and then \ncatch adds another four so then there's \nlike a minimum threshold right and so \nlet's say it's four now the minimum \ndistance after you've scored this many \nso now these remaining terms how and two \nthey can only possibly add 3.17 to the \nscore so the search is over so all in \nall what this leads to is just less uh \nscoring calculations for scoring the \nbm25 and thus a faster you know \ncalculation of bm25 scores with this \nwand algorithm where you're using this \nminimum uh threshold to prune it and say \nno forget it it's not possible for this \nto add more to the score \nso also you can check this out if you're \nreally interested in all the details \nbehind exactly how this Implement is \nimplemented uh here's the link to the \nimplementation and going \ncool so that's right hey Connor I've got \na question so if you go back \num well yeah here oh no the the next one \nso \nwhen when does this happen where you \nkind of like score like Pollock Alaskan \nin cash that's like when we score like \nthe the query level even before the \nquery begins \nyeah \nso you can sort them by uh so so you \nhave these lengths and so you sort them \nin reverse order because you know it's \nlike inversely the less it appears the \nmore it can add to the score so yeah you \nfirst you sort it and then you can uh \ncompute the minimum threshold so exactly \nwhat how this is done with with the top \nK I'm not exactly sure of that detail \nbut \nbasically you sort it and then you can \nlike calculate what that threshold would \nbe based on having because you you uh \ncalculate these numbers by you you would \nhave this number from the length of the \ninverted index basically oh yeah so \nbasically because I'm speaking of like \nobviously um I'm new still to the field \nand everything right so I'm basically \ntrying to figure out from the point of \nview of so when does it happen so does \nthis happen at the time when like we \nimport our data and we create this index \nokay yeah yeah no change to event is \nneeded it can this can just build right \non the inverted index that you already \nhave you don't need to say upgrade V8 \n1.18 and then re-import all your data \nyou can just 117 or however to 118 and \nthen just or I guess 117 is when bm25 \ncame out but anyways so like 117 to 118 \nand you can just use this you don't need \nto re-index \noh cool cool yeah \nnice and then like with this basically \nthe bf-25 surge is just like smarter \nbecause it's just going to ignore words \nthat just like keywords that don't \nreally add much to the results right \nyeah like yeah you have to how I was \nlike yeah that's basically every single \ndocument I have right \nyeah exactly it's nice it's the cool I I \nhave a question so is my understanding \ncorrect that let's say you have a huge \nquery \nthis is basically picking out the rarest \nwords \nuh in that query based on how rare those \nwords are in your database and then you \norder them from rarest to most common \nand then you say if I've got this many \nrare words don't look for any other \ncommon words and that removal of all \nthose common words from the scoring \nprocess is what speeds things up is that \nis that the correct understanding yeah \nthat's exactly it and I think \num \nwell you you said something with that \nthat made me question my understanding a \nlittle bit because if you well oh okay \nsorry so yeah yes exactly because you do \nit with the query if you have a this is \nhow to catch an Alaska right like six \nwords so it's pretty easy to visualize \nit I don't know what it was about you \njust said that inspired me to think \nabout like querying with like a \nparagraph but if you're querying with \nlike an entire paragraph I mean that \nwould be an interesting test to run I \nguess I haven't really done that kind of \ntest but that would be like a stress \ntest of this right yeah yeah because if \nyou have like let's say 20 common words \nthe sum total of that could end up being \npretty high that it needs to keep doing \nit until yeah yeah \nyeah now this is cool right yeah \nthat's why I like we be there because \nlike we're teaching to each other and \nthen suddenly it's like wait what like \nlet me ask questions yeah we should \nalmost have like a follow-up session \njust like now testing out ideas \nyeah nice nice \ncool \num did you did you have anything else to \nadd or what's what's happening next \noh uh yeah this is all I have for uh the \nwand \noh perfect thanks \num so I want to give give a quick shout \njust uh before I hand it over to you \nErica so like uh Carson uh is uh saying \nhi from casual in Germany uh so he's \nlooking forward to using we with 118. \nit's like um yeah like I'm super excited \nto hear that and let us know how it goes \nand uh Russ says great stuff so um yeah \nthanks rash thank you for encouragement \nso um yeah anybody else just like give \nus a shout and of course right at the \nbeginning Connor was like stepping in \nthank you for watching I think that you \nsend it before even I got to say it \nright so he's such a pro Conor \nall right so moving on Erica I'm kicking \nthe Baton yeah let's do it right so you \nwill be talking now about bm25 hybrid \nimprovements which is pretty close to \nthe topic of one than the stuff that \nConnor was explaining right yeah exactly \nso bm25 and hybrid was released in 117 \nand yesterday we released 118. but \nreally what we were focusing on was how \ncan we improve bn25 and hybrid so Conor \nwent over one and this the simplest way \nto start using wand and really apply it \nto large scale data and applications is \njust by upgrading a repeat instance \nwhich is exactly what Connor said so \nit's kind of cool that it's that simple \nto use it and see the performance \nimprovements um but what I'm covering \ntoday specifically is we added in \nstopword removals um it's now indexed \nwhereas previously it was not and then \nalso added we added in the wear filter \nto bm25 and hybrid \num I guess you can share my screen I'm \nstill talking a little bit to like kind \nof built it up but um \nit ignored the stopword configuration \nand scored all of the words so as you \ncan imagine if we are queering with a \nlarge paragraph and it has \nthe and what many times it it will be \nvery slow \num so ignoring them speeds up queries \nthat contain stop words as they can be \nautomatically removed from queries as \nwell \num and that's obviously important for \nstop words so here I'm using the podcast \nsearch demo that I showed previously \num Conor a GitHub repository and using \nit but what I'm showing here is that you \ncan use the brask API to update your \nstop birds even after your data has \nalready been indexed \num oh wait so are you saying that I \nalready have an existing schema \nand then I can update it oh neat yes yes \num so here I have added in so my date \nI've already uploaded my data it is \nindexed I have my schema defined but now \nwhat I'm showing is that we are adding \nin a few additional soft Words which is \nwhat the an is and this preset is set to \nEnglish \num but you can also have none and then \nadd in additional \num stop words in here but then you can \nalso add in \noh no I removed it really quick \num you can also add in hey this is how \nwe navigate through our documentation \njust live a little preview \num so here you can also have removal so \nif you do want to include a or the this \nis where you would Define that \nall right ah \nit's like the opposite of ignore it's \nlike included too yes exactly all right \nso I'm going to uh run this and then I'm \ngoing to head over to my B1 schema \nrefresh it and what you can see is I the \nadditional is what and as you can see \npreviously I had added in B and is but \nbecause it's already included in the \nEnglish preset \num the only new one that was added in is \njust what and that's really \nErica could you zoom in a little bit \njust just to make it bigger yeah \nI'm so sorry this is \nthe preset of English \nhey does that mean we could um mess up \nwith Connor's example and like add \nAlaskan and Pollock to to the list and \nthen he would never get the results ever \nagain yes that's a good secret can we do \nit \nwell \nyou need the database the database to \nhave something about Alaskan pollock in \nit yeah as in We're Not Gonna \nnecessarily test that query right but \nlike I just want to see how easy it is \nto just add additional words now now \nthat you've done it \nyeah so here I've added in beer and \nrelease because I know that's talked \nabout frequently on the podcast and then \nI'm just gonna run this again and then \nrefresh \nand I could see that it was added in see \nthe stalker variable \num so yeah the results would it be in \nyour favor if you accidentally did this \nyou're just too nice for Connor like you \ndidn't want to mess up with these \nAlaskan Bullocks huh \nbut this is cool how fast is this update \nso can you can you tell us like what \nhappens underneath right like when we \nadd these additions do these keywords \nget removed from the sparse vector or \nsparse is that the right word as well \ninspectors well now they're stop words \nbut it's different from 118 is that they \nare indexed but when you are creating a \nbm25 they are \num \nremoved for relevance ranking because if \nit's going to rank the and and it's kind \nof going to boost results even if that's \nnot really what you're looking for so \nthe key here is just kind of to remove \nthose um like the relevance ranking for \nthe in and like or beer and release or \nwhat \nthis example sounds good yes \num all right so and then the next thing \nthat I want to show is the wear filter \nso we have finally added it in for bm25 \nand hybrid but just with this example \nI'm taking the Pod clip and I'm asking a \nquery on what were the features released \nin 117 and just similarly um to 117 this \nworks right but what is new is the wear \nfilter which is great I will show \nthe ticket that had like I think 30 \nepisodes \num so what do I want I know that Conor \nedian and Parker talked about \num \nthe 117 release and podcast 31 so I will \njust narrow it down to the podnum \nsorry \nokay and then operator \nis equal and then just my value int of \n31. \nso now as you can see all the Pod \nnumbers are referring to podcast31 and \nthis is where we have Connor speaking \nConnor's speaking a lot oh but then we \nhave Eddie and as well that is related \nto talking about the features that were \nreleased in 117. so you can see that the \nmain focus for that podcast was talking \nabout replication and hybrid search \num yeah \nwow so um we basically combining three \nkinds of search uh like filters right so \nwe have Vector search like we have the \nbm25 search because of hybrid and then \nwe have scalar search \ntime \nthat's that's pretty possibilities yeah \nand what I wanted \nthe Highlight here is that this feature \nwas built off of a request by someone in \nthe community a result in Federer \num this had 34 uploads which is insane \nso I just want to make a point that if \nyou want to contribute to the features \nthat would be included in 119 or even \n120 \num you can head over to the doc \ndevelopers docs and then on the bottom \nhere we have the roadmap then you can \nclick on it \nand you'll be taken to the GitHub \nproposal and then you can upload it so \nplease this is the time as we're \nplanning for 119 \num your voice matters absolutely \nI mean I I can give you some like a \nsecret uh Intel that I know like so at \nthe end our CTO uh he's actually \nplanning to like a look at some of those \nitems in the backlog and then some of \nthose more popular ones would definitely \nget a lot more attention from at the end \nso very much like Erica said like we are \nvery much like roadmap at feedback \ndriven and if you feel like there's \nsomething that's very important there \ngive it an upvote give it just like that \nright Erica believes this one is very \nimportant right so uh yeah just just \nlike Erica said but like my pony is like \nyou can do it like right now like even \nthis week because you could influence \nwhat will go into 180 19 or maybe 120. \nso um there's no time like now right \ncool this is pretty pretty amazing thank \nyou for the demo Erica anyone have any \nother questions \none question I had was how does the \nremoval of stop words work with the um \nthe Rarity of words and then ignoring \nthe non-rare words because I would \nimagine the stop words would be the \nnon-rare words and then if those are \nremoved then whatever is left over \ndoes that does that make Connor's Point \neven stronger because now you don't have \na lot of garbage uncommon words stop \nwords takes care of that now The \nUncommon words are even \num they're they're \nI guess removing those is even more \npowerful now right am I understanding \nthat correctly or \nI see \nI mean yeah it's like in the example if \nwe remove the bottom three now the least \ncommon I guess would be catch right or \nthe most common that has like the less \nweight would be catchy so it really puts \nthat focus on Pollock and Alaskan \nah so the these two features are kind of \nsynergistic because the the the wand \nupdate doesn't need to take uh take care \nof a bunch of common words the stop word \nupdate gets rid of those and then you \nreally focus in on the most important \nword foreign \nand correct me if I'm wrong anybody here \nbut like it's almost like it gives us an \nability to kind of uh say which words \nshould be completely ignored but let's \nsay you have a furniture company uh so \nthen what Conor was explaining matching \nto a chair because basically chairs will \nprobably be mentioned like once every 10 \ntimes like we have like an item in the \ncatalog so magic to watch wouldn't be so \nimportant because of want but at the \nsame time we still still will be a \nvaluable match right but then a specific \nkind of chair right like that could have \nlike a you know just like Ikea and other \ncompanies are doing right like that they \nhave a name so because those would be \nrarer like in terms of how often they \nappear they will appear even more but I \nthink with like the the stopwatch itself \nyou could kind of go like yeah just \nignore every time somebody says woot or \nor something like you could even have \nlike terms they go like yeah like I \ndon't value these mattress so much or \nlike at all and I think that could be \naway right yeah that's a good way of \nputting it the con the stop words \nfeature gets rid of generally common \nthings and then the uh the part that the \ntfidf part that Conor was talking about \nthen after having removed the generally \ncommon words now it says of the \ninteresting words which ones are rare \nand which ones are common so it's even \nyeah that's a good way of putting into \nquestion yeah totally so you know like \num I'm sure if you haven't been to Ikea \nor buying a bookshelf so nothing to \nbookshelf like you give you like a small \nscore but if you say Billy like yeah \nthat would get like a pretty high score \nright like uh and uh I'm sure that \nanybody's ever been to Ikea knows what's \na daily bookshelf bookshelf \nno interesting \nmaybe I have too many books \ngreat great this this is amazing this is \ngreat and um I love the addition of of \nthe wear filter \num that's definitely been very needed \nand uh yeah \nperfect so any anything else that you \nwant to cover \nno that's all online I'll pass it over \nperfect so \num who have we got next so we have hnsw \nand PQ \num who was doing that that's me \nif you can share my screen absolutely \nthere you go all right okay let me show \nyour face again \nall right so let me jump into it so 1.18 \nadds this uh new Vector compression \nfeature called Product quantization and \nit works with uh our uh our hnsw index \nand it essentially makes it so that you \ncan store your vectors in memory with \none-fourth the requirements that \none-fourth can change depending on the \nparameters for PQ that you set so I want \nto give just a quick five minute intro \nto what PQ is and how you might be able \nto use it okay \nso imagine that is one vector that \nyou're storing \nso this can be any any dimensional \nVector okay what PQ does what we do \nright now is we store this vector and we \nhave millions like this that are being \nstored in memory which takes a lot of \nmemory what PQ allows you to do is the \nvery first thing you do is you chunk up \nyour vector into n segments that's one \nparameter so you choose whether you want \neight segments or 100 segments the upper \nlimit there is the dimensionality of the \nof the vector of course you can't have \nmore segments than you have dimensions \nuh then you take \neach segment and let's just have a look \nat the first segment for now you do the \nsame thing with every segment but let's \nconsider the first segment and let's \ntake the first segment of all of your \nvectors so I've just drawn two vectors \nthere but imagine these are all of your \nvectors you take all of the first \nsegments of your vectors \nand you plot them out right so the first \nVector is there the third Vector is \nthere and then all the other vectors \ncontribute their first segments as well \nnow what we're going to do is instead of \npay attention to where each Vector is \nlocated which takes a lot of space we're \ngoing to create neighborhoods of vectors \nso I'm going to create this neighborhood \nwhere these two vectors live together \nthis neighborhood where only this Vector \nlives this neighborhood where this \nVector lives and then so now that we've \ngot these larger neighborhoods these \nclusters of vectors instead of defining \nthe vector uniquely using its \ncoordinates here what we're in set going \nto do is Define these neighborhoods \nusing their centroids and this is where \nthe second parameter comes in which is \nKate you can decide how finely you want \nto segregate these uh vectors by saying \nI want a lot of neighborhoods I want a \nthousand neighborhoods or you can say I \nwant 20 neighborhoods so there's going \nto be very very large neighborhoods \nyou're going to have a lot more vectors \nper neighborhood but the whole idea is \nthat every neighborhood gets its own \ncentroid which has a coordinate and it \nhas its own ID now instead of referring \nto a piece of a vector this first \nsegment of vector one by the coordinates \nthat are unique to it we're instead \ngoing to take those coordinates and \nwe're going to replace it with the \ncentroid ID for this centroid so any \nVector that lives in that neighborhood \nwill now not be referred with its unique \ncoordinates but rather with a centroid \nID so instead of having to store all of \nthese numbers now you're just storing \nthe name for that centroid and this is \nwhere the memory saving comes in so if \nyou have your database to begin with \nyou've got right now this is what you \nhave \nEQ is going to chunk that chunk this up \nand it's going to do the same \ncalculation over and over again for \nevery segment \nand it's going to turn this first \nsegment here into a centroid ID the \nsecond segment here into a centroid ID \nand if you implement this over your \nentire entire database \nyou'll have just all these segments now \nchunked up into centroid ID so instead \nof having to store numbers here you only \nhave to store uh \ncentroid IDs instead \nand if you understood none of that let \nme just abstract all the details away \nand let's let's uh get uh down to just \nthe intuition let's say every Vector is \nan address that you're storing so you \ncan have the house number the street \nnumber you can have which uh \nneighborhood I'm living in what state \nI'm in what country I'm in so on and so \nforth and then all the way at the top \nI'm living in on planet Earth \nPQ allows you to zoom out and say I \ndon't really care about the house number \nI don't really care about the street \nnumber I only care about the state that \nZayn is living in and now you're going \nto have a bunch of people that live in \nthe same state so you have a course or \nrepresentation for each Vector but that \ncourse representation allows you to save \non memory requirements right so some of \nthe experimentation that we've done \nallows you to save one save and store \nthe vectors in 1 4 the memory \nrequirement so that's one fourth the ram \npreviously required so that's a speed up \nbut it's it doesn't come for free right \nso the the one thing that you have to \nbalance when you're using PQ is that the \nlower the more you compress the vectors \nthe lower you get the memory you're \npaying for that in terms of recall \nbecause now you're summarizing vectors \nin terms of the neighborhood that they \nlive in using those centroids right so \nit is a balance between \nhow much recall you need versus how much \nmemory uh savings you want to you want \nto realize so that's a quick summary of \nuh of PQ and that works with hnsw you \ncan look into documentation and by \ndefault we don't enable PQ and it's \nexperimental right now but if you want \nto play around with it you can enable \nset the enable flag underneath PQ in the \nconfiguration to true and there's a \nbunch of other details and settings that \nyou can play around within the \nconfiguration you can read more about \nthat in the docs and Sebastian will add \nthe link to the docs in the the \ndescription of the video as well \nso I guess if we want to find like a \nbalance of the higher recall and lower \nmemory is there like a how could we \noptimize K where we could have like a \nbalance between the two \nuh so it would depend on the size of \nyour vectors really because the the \nlower K is you're basically saying if I \ngo back here you're basically saying if \nyou decrease K to one you're saying \nidentify the address of a person uh \nusing one centroid and that'll just be \nokay this person lives on Earth which is \nnot very helpful and so the recall is \ngoing to take a major major hit it's \ngoing to be horrible but then you could \nsay Okay I I can afford to have more \nmemory so now I'll zoom in further I'll \nI'll give everybody their own \nneighborhood I'll give everybody their \naddress so it's a there's a work there's \nactually a blog post that's going to \ncome out next week around the details of \nthis so you can read more about the \nbalance between memory saving and recall \num there is a cut off that we'll mention \nthere where you can compress it down and \nthen to a certain degree which is this \none-fourth after which the the price and \nrecall that you pay is not worth it \nokay so there's like a diminishing \nreturn at some point exactly it does \nPlateau off so that's a that's the good \nthing so you can keep on compressing the \nvectors and then you when you see recall \ntaking a very big hit that's when you \nknow where the cutoff is thanks loved \nyour explanation and this circle it's \nlike okay how many kids great job yeah \nyeah I want to also hop in and firstly \nsay the slides were gray I love the \nwhole presentation I I love how you put \nthe uh the chunks into the points as \nwell that was awesome we go back to that \nslide actually \nwith the uh with the two going into the \npoint yeah I love how you animate it in \nthe regions that was awesome yeah I was \nlike if I have a video for this that'd \nbe great but I don't have a video so \nlet's just make a PowerPoint video so \nyeah we should turn that into a gif and \nlike tweet it yeah \num the funny thing was like when \ninitially you had just like those two \narrows pointing out uh like and they \nwere not pointing at anything I was like \nwhat are those hours pointing at and I \nwas like wait wait those are vectors \nthey're not just arrows right yeah \nany drops \nthey're not arrows or vectors \num hey so you mentioned at the beginning \nthat is the other two parameters or is \nthere one parameter like is there K in \nthe dimensionality we want or yeah so N \nis a parameter here how many segments uh \nyou want to yeah cut the cut the vector \nup into and then for each one of those \nsegments the second parameter is this \nguy right how many centroids to look for \nfor each segment \nyeah so so like almost okay so let me \nthink about it so if I have my Vector \nthat has 1024 for dimensions and I could \nsay like I want to shrink it down to 32 \nDimensions right so that's the end and \nand uh value yeah would that mean that I \nwould end up with 30 yeah go on for for \n1024 dimensional Vector if you want each \none of these segments to be 32 \ndimensional then you would have to set n \nto 1024 divided by 32. and N has to be a \nconstant multiple so that each you don't \nhave like a portion of a vector \nDimension hanging in one segment and and \nthe other half hanging in the other \nsegment right so is there reverse where \nif I want to actually have 32 segments \nso I have to do a calculation of was the \nn \nthen you have to do a calculation of how \nwhat the end should be yeah oh no I just \nwant 32 segments right so \num okay so if I have done 32 segments do \nI get a centroid per segment or the \ncentroid is just calculated based on \nthis reduced Vector you get you get K \ncentroids per segment \nso every every segment is going to have \nthese vectors and then you calculate \nlet's say a 124 centroids per segment so \neach one of these guys is going to this \nis going to be 124 centroids this is \ngoing to be 100 in separate different \n124 centroids and you can also choose \nhow uh what that K is right one 124 or \n500 1000. okay okay because I I felt \nlike um the biggest memory saving is in \nin a space of like how much we compress \nthe the vectors themselves right so if I \ninitially started 1024 and I shrunk it \nto 32 that's just like a tiny fraction \nright and yeah so here if you if you \nhave less segments then you will \neventually have less centroids overall \nbecause here let's say you have 10 \nsegments and for each segment you have \n100 centroids you have a thousand \ncentroids in total but let's say you \nonly have two segments then you only \nhave 200 centroids so that's a that's a \ncost saving in memory but then also how \nmany centroids each segment has if you \nreduce that that's also a cost saving so \nyou can take the memory down to being \nnothing and you'll have no recall that's \nwhy it's a it's a it's a delicate \nbalance yeah and then okay so that \nthat's this part and then later on when \nI do run a query unlike on those reduced \nvectors yeah \num so what happens like first we go to a \nneighborhood based on the centroid of \nour query we pick all the candidates but \nthen the scoring and the distance \ncalculated based on the full Vector \nright \nso that is uh if you read the paper on \ndisk a n that's how it works but right \nnow that full Vector is not uh stored \num on disk that that might be a feature \nthat we Implement in the future but how \ndistancing calculations work right now \nis you can take a vector and then you \nfind out which neighborhood that Vector \nresides in and then you can calculate \nthe distance between let's say there's a \nnew let's say this is a new query Vector \nyou find out that it lives in this \nneighborhood for the first segment you \nyou know the centroid you know the \ncoordinates of the centroid you can \ncalculate the distance between the query \nvector and the centroid and you do that \nfor every centroid in every segment \num another future work uh right now is \nyou can actually \nstore the complete Vector \nrepresentations on disk which is much \ncheaper and then if you want to do \ndistance calculations you can bring them \ninto into working memory \nand calculate exact distances if you \nhave the complete vectors but right now \nwe don't have the complete vectors we \njust have the compressed vectors if you \nenable PQ \ncool cool yeah I always mix up that \ndetail of whether the compressed vectors \nare compressed and my understanding is \nthat they're compressed in memory and \nthen they're fully represented vectors \nare on disk and then you would um you \ndecompress them with some error and then \nlook for the nearest Neighbors on disk I \nalways mix up that detail movie yeah \nfrom what from what I understand the \nmain uh RAM savings come from the fact \nthat your compressed vectors are stored \nin in working memory in Ram and the full \nrepresentations are stored on disk so \nyou do your high level search in memory \nand then once you have your best \ncandidates then you go to disk you read \nthem in and then you can do more \nfine-tuned exact searching over those \nlimited candidates \nall right yeah so basically that that's \nwhat I meant with my question so yeah \nbecause that yeah the saving is like \ninstead of storing 10 million 1024 \nDimensions big uh vectors I can start 10 \nmillion 32 exactly big so that's like 32 \ntimes less exactly uh memory footprint \nbut then once I found the initial \ncandidates based on the uh the \nneighborhood we can kind of like go in \nand then score them based on the full \nVector right exactly yeah but but then \nbecause the first trip is like super \nfast \num we can kind of like uh take the heat \nof doing a discrete as a one-off and \nthen do that distance calculation yeah \nthis is powerful stuff so I have a \nquestion \num and then and I realized there were \nalso questions \num from from stop words but uh we but \nfirst let's let's uh talk about PQ so \nRaj is asking uh well or first is very \ncool small question will PQ affect the \ntime taken for Vector search performance \non large indexes like 15 mil plus \nvectors \nso it um \nVector search performance on large \nindexes \nthis is so the the blog that we're \nplanning on releasing next week actually \nlooks at uh latency considerations as \nwell but mainly the idea behind this is \nnot not to uh it's not going to take \nlonger or shorter but the main idea is \nthat you need less memory requirements \nokay so PQ is not going to \num it might take a little bit longer \num because you have to do this uh \nreading in from memory type of thing \nthat I described which we're looking at \nin the future but the main trade-off \nhere is not latency \num latency and recall which is the which \nis the main case and let me go back to \nmy slide here in in hnsw the main \ntrade-off is recall and latency here the \ntrade-off that you have to decide is how \nmuch recall do you want to trade for \nbeing able to save memory so it's more \naround memory space requirements as \nopposed to time requirements \nwe've got also a question and probably \nwe don't have this right now right but \num how do we know if we're planning on \nsharing some benchmarks this is what uh \nwe're going to talk about this in the \nblog post next week where we do a deep \ndive on PQ so look forward to that and \nthen we'll also have more details then \nyeah so thank you for questions Raj and \nvinod and uh yeah just just keep keep an \neye on our blog post then uh because uh \nas far as I I I remember as well the \nplan is to even post two separate blog \nposts on the topic because there's so \nmuch to talk about uh but thank you for \nsharing the questions because that also \nhelps us shape some of that content and \num yeah next week Tuesday we should have \nthat the first blog post from the series \num so this is really cool \num yeah any other questions around PQ \nbefore we move on \nthere you go \nthanks rashford yeah no worries uh thank \nyou for asking this is why I love this \nwhole session being live \ncool okay so let's go back to \num the topic with stop words \nuh if we are done here and so we had a \nquestion well first this is not a \nquestion you know this is a shout out so \nuh thank you we really appreciate it \nmakes us even happier uh to to work on \nit and I would definitely pass it on \nwithin the company \nso let's look at the actual question so \nare there any performance trade-offs to \nconsider when adding a large number of \nstop words \ndo we do we know or is that a question \nwe should probably get back to later \nthat's an interesting question but also \nuh thanks for the compliment and like \nSebastian said it'll be shared with the \nteam \num but \num I'm not sure I mean I know Connor is \nworking on the beer benchmarks \num and maybe there is a data set within \nthat that has where you can add in a \nlarge number of stop words and then kind \nof compare the performance \num but previously but the demo that I \nused for a podcast search I was looking \ninto the natural questions which is \nwithin the um beer data set \num and it's kind of tricky because there \naren't really that many stop words and \nthe performance I didn't really see a \ndifference when I've removed it but \nmaybe Conor has something to add \nto this \num I well I think it's I I think the \nkind of customized stop words \nis probably best for like a multi like \nlow resource languages languages where \nyou need that kind of domain expertise \nthat's probably where I would where I \ninterpreted as having the most \napplication um \nbecause you'd be tuning a really long \nlist of words to try to like speed up \nthe beer benchmarks particularly yeah \nI I think what we're looking at is \nbecause maybe the stock was by \nthemselves are not about like making \nquerying faster but the real true \nbenefit is can they make your results \nbetter right \nbecause By ignoring the wrong stuff like \nthe stuff that you don't want \nnecessarily to be part of the query you \ncan get better results better results \nbut maybe and that's something maybe we \njust have to test out and we can come \nback next time around as vaccine like \nhey what did what is what would happen \nif I had like a thousand stop words \nwould that affect the performance right \nso not so much like would that make it \nfaster but would that could that \npotentially make it slower that would be \nan interesting thing to figure out \nand I'm sure if atien was on the call or \nlike somewhere from engineering they \nwould have had the answers straight away \nso maybe next time we should have them \non online \nCoco all right thank you for the \nquestions and you know like this is part \nof being live you know sometimes there \nare questions we don't have the answers \nstraight away but uh we can always \nfigure out maybe you can add the answers \nto the documentation uh once we figure \nit out so that'll be cool \nperfect so who have we got what have we \ngot next so we covered \num bm25 hsw and then now we will talk \nabout the update to the replica yeah \nreplication update with tunable \nconsistency and Repair on read \num I believe that's done right then \nthat'll be me indeed \nso you need to share your screen \noh yeah I can show the documentation uh \nthere's no demo but um I can show a few \nGraphics that hopefully will help you \nunderstand replication especially if you \nhaven't been following along uh we \nintroduced application in the previous \nversion 117 \nand in this version We enrich the future \nset \nso to help you understand what happened \nin this version \num I'll briefly go over what replication \nis essentially you can replicate an \nobject in a class to a number of nodes \nso in this diagram you can look at the \num the class A for instance let's say \nit's a for article and you see that out \nof the six nodes here three of them have \nthis green marker \nso that means every object in the class \nis replicated on three nodes and three \nis the application Factor \nand the replication is useful for a \nnumber of use cases first being high \navailability if a node goes down your \nsetup still functions \nand then you can linearly increase \nthroughput by adding nodes you can also \nupgrade with no downtime \nor you take one node out and the others \nwill still process and return results \noriginal proximity is obviously helped \nand um \nwhen you build a distributed database \nwith the application you have to choose \ntwo out of three properties \none of them is consistency which means \nyou get the latest version of an object \nthat was written on every read There is \nthe address availability it means you \nalways get a response even if some nodes \nare down \nand the other is partition tolerance \nwhich means the system will still \nfunction if nodes individually do not \nand uh \nthe um \nthe trade-offs between consistency and \navailability is what you can \ncontrol all operations now in version \n18. so this is called tunable \nconsistency \nand there are three values for this \nthe first one is one which means that a \nread or write return as soon as one of \nthe nodes responds \nQuorum which means that your request \nwill return after a majority of nodes \nrespond majority means half of the \nreplication Factor plus one \nand then finally we have all which means \nall nodes in the replica set must \nrespond \nso we need to use this all for scheme \noperations \nto ensure \nfull consistency \nbut for reads or writes over the rest \nAPI you can choose between one column or \nall \nfor graphql we do not support \nconsistency that's tunable yet but this \nmight be implemented in a future version \nand to visualize how this works \nwe can look at the Quorum consistency \nlevel so in this damn you have the \nreplication coordinator node that \nreceives a request from the and this \nsends it out to \nn nodes the replication Factor so here \nis three \nyou have three arrows going out and you \ncan notice that only two arrows come \nback so that means a majority of nodes \nhave responded the replication \ncoordinator node is happy and Returns \nthe result of the client \nuh there are a number of scenarios \nfor consistency versus availability that \nyou can choose from \nso Quorum and Quorum for reason right \nwill give you a balanced write and \nrelatency or if you need fast rights and \nslow reads you can choose one for rights \nso you only wait for one node to respond \nbefore the right is acknowledged and \nthen um \nall reads means that you have to wait \nfor all the nodes to respond before you \nget the result \nor if you need the fast reads you invert \nthose so you have the all consistency \nlevel for rights and one for reason \nso that would be tunable consistency \nand then we have repairs \nso imagine a scenario like this um you \nwrite \nan object with a consistency level one \nand that note dies before it can \npropagate your object to the other nodes \nso in that case when you read the object \nagain with the consistent consistency \nlevel one it's possible that you'll hit \nanother node not the one that accepted \nthe right so in that case you might uh \nnot get the object at all or if you had \nthe patch operation you would get the \nprevious version of it \nbut if you had used consistency level \nall for that read that means vv8 will \nwait for all nodes to return and it will \nsee that one of the nodes did have your \nnew object or the updated one while the \nothers didn't have it \nso then it would automatically propagate \nthe changes or the creation to the other \nnodes and it will return the latest \nversion so this is called the last right \nwins \nmodel for solving consistency conflicts \nand it's what movie it uses \nand we explain here in the consistency \ndocumentation page \nwhat happens when you write an object \nand then when you want to guarantee that \nit has been propagated so essentially \nyou need to read it with a high enough \nconsistency level compared to the one \nthat was used when writing the object \nthat's essentially it you cannot check \nout the blog release or replication \nand here we cover both number of \nconsistency updates and Repair on read \ncool \num I got a question so where do you add \nthis configuration or like where do you \nprovide like you know say like I want to \nuse Quorum versus all or majority \num so this is used um \nin the rest API \nuh for every right every read and every \nright endpoint \nwhen you get when you create an object \nyou can specify the consistency level \nhere \nah cool \nis is there a way to change the default \nbehavior I'm not sure how if you went \nover that \num the default is Quorum I should have \nmentioned this and there's no way to \nchange that you change it per operation \nokay okay all right I'm supported by all \nnodes sorry all endpoints which means \nalso creating cross references \nsupported again you can specify the \nconsistency level here and also for \nbatch operations \ninteresting \nCoco \nperfect any questions from maybe from \nthe audience \nhey we got a question \nso uh Dan what replication protocol \nalgorithm does we would use \ndo you have the answer \nwhat replication protocol does it that's \nsomething \num pretty low level I cannot answer it \nright now but I'll get back to the user \non slack if they are there and we cannot \npick a documentation as well \nyeah that would be a good question like \nyeah if you're part of like our slack \nmaybe drop it on General and then we \ncould definitely uh come back to it \nthank you for the question \nanybody else any other questions in here \nor from the audience \nperfect \num it definitely shows uh who wrote the \ndocumentation on this because uh you you \nare so good like walking over to the \ncontent \nit's almost as if you wrote it yourself \nmy um \nnice nicely done cool all right so who \nhave we got next \nso on the list of topics uh we have \nroaring beatbox and I believe that is \nZen \nZen I'm going to share your screen \nand you can take it away sounds good \nokay so roaring bitmaps are \num we've implemented implemented a new \ndata structure in our inverted index so \nbefore I kind of drown you in jargon \nlet's start off at the top \nso what do these do \num so they essentially speed up filtered \nsearch up to a thousand X and the \nThousand X is the attention grabber here \nWe've ran some uh experiments where \nwe've got a thousand X Improvement then \nwhat the heck are pre-filtered searches \nso pre-filtered searches are basically \nthink of let's say you're running an \ne-commerce store and you've got 10 000 \nunique items that are up for sale in \nyour eCommerce store a user comes in and \nthey ask for \nthey have a search query they're looking \nfor furniture you're not going to run \nthat query against all 10 000 unique \nitems that you have in your store you're \ngoing to pre-filter the search such that \nyou only look for look at items let's \nsay 2 000 items that are in the \nfurniture uh category so you pre-filter \nthe search such that you don't have to \nlook over 8 000 items you drop those out \nat the at the outset so how we V8 works \nis we have an inverted index that has a \nreference to every object so it's \nessentially just a list of unique uh \nitem identifiers and then there's the \nhnsw index that we talked a little bit \nabout when we were talking about hnswpq \nwhich allows you to do Vector search \napproximate nearest neighbor search \nso the inverted index is what we've \nmodified with this roaring bitmaps \nupdate \nand what it essentially allows you to do \nis the inverted index is now implemented \nusing the rowing set data structure and \nthe efficiency that this unlocks is if \nyou've got a filter let's say you're \nlooking for items that are of furniture \ntype in my in my store and above a \nparticular price \nuh those operations are really efficient \nwhen done using this new data structure \nand the other thing the other speed up \nis that because we natively implement \nthe inverted index using the Roaring set \ndata structure we don't have to convert \ninto the new roaring set data structure \nthat when we have a filter \nso we save on latency of of that \nconversion as well right \nand mainly where we see that thousand X \nImprovement is if you've got a filtered \nsearch where the allow list the \nallowable or the interesting items to \nsearch over so in my previous example if \nthe user had a question about furniture \nand they were searching over Furniture \nthe allow list would include the 2000 \nFurniture items and not the 8 000 \nremaining other items like clothing \nhygiene products all that stuff right so \nthis allow list where you get that 1000x \nImprovement is if the allow list is \nbasically your entire database so \nimagine somebody goes into Amazon and \nsearches for opens up a filter and says \nsearch for items that cost more than a \ndollar your allow list is going to have \neverything in there because barely \nanything cost less than a dollar \nso now your allow list is basically your \nentire database this is the same as \nrunning \nnon-filtered search you're running every \nquery has to go through every single \nobject in your database which is really \nslow and the problem is that because \nit's implemented as a filter search \nyou're still going to filter everything \nand the filter is not going to have any \neffect it just adds a bunch of latency \nand this is where the uh the time \nsavings are realized right if you had \npreviously a huge uh allowed list where \nyour filter was all encompassing your \nentire database we would first of all \ngenerate the filter which would be \nuseless but we would still do it and \nthen we would convert that filter and \nsend that to hnsw and it would search \nover all of those uh all of those \nvectors and that's where that's what \nwould take a lot of time \nin terms of what this means if you've \nalready got your inverted index in in \nthe previous data structure in 1.17 you \ncan choose to stay on the old inverted \nindex you don't have to migrate but you \nwon't get the 1000x speed improvements \nespecially for these very large allow \nlist queries but what you can do is you \ncan choose to do a one-time migrate and \nthat will change your inverted index and \nwe'll convert it into this roaring \nbitmap data structure and after that \nit's a one-time change and after that \nyou'll have a speedier filtered searches \nhey Zen um quickly so you said like we \ncan stay on the old inverted index is it \nby like I can upgrade to 118 and still \nstay on the old exactly so you can you \ncan upgrade to 118 and you can still \nstay on on the old inverted index or you \ncan there's a migrate option where you \ncan choose to migrate your uh your \ninverted index to uh using roaring \nbitmaps and then your 118 will actually \nyou'll see the uh the Thousand x uh \nimprovements yeah and of course like the \nthe 1000x is really for like a large \ndata set yeah exactly so my data sets \nhave like a thousand objects it's like \nyeah so your allowance is of a thousand \nthat's not so big when it's like nine \nmillion yeah yeah like let me show you \nan example so this is a a screen grab \nfrom uh what Etienne tweeted earlier \nthere's a bunch of details here \num that are not as relevant but what I \nwanted to point out here is let's say \nyou have estimate estimated matches of \nwhere you're allow list is almost the \nentire database of a database of 10 \nmillion it's 9.99 million in 1.17 this \nquery would take five and a half seconds \nthe same query in 1.18 takes three \nmilliseconds right and then as your \nallow list size decreases your your \nsearch time decreases but you can see \nthat it's always an improvement it's \njust strictly an improvement it never \nmakes anything worse because uh the the \nnew data structure is much more \nefficient in um in the calculations that \nneed to be computed \nthat's everything that I have and I even \nsee some examples because obviously like \nsometimes it's sort of like stays like \nthere was like seven milliseconds before \nit's seven milliseconds now and then \nit's like like 1000 sort of like roughly \nbecause yeah going from 5400 that's like \nmore than a thousand but then there's \nsome others when it's not not as a \nthousand right there so but definitely I \nguess the key here is like hey you're \nworking on 10 million objects or more \nlike you want to get like a billion \nobjects in yeah that could be super uh \nsuper useful yeah and I believe for this \none the reason why it doesn't budge is \nbecause this is unfiltered search so \nit's not it's not you're not using the \nfilter uh anyways in this oh yeah so \nit's fast by default anyway yeah good \npoint good point I didn't look closely \nenough \num but I think that there's like a \ncouple of benefits to it like not only \nthat the queries are fast but also if \nsuddenly your users start throwing loads \nof queries that have like a huge allow \nlist then you could overload your \nservers right like suddenly your servers \nare less responsive because these few \npeople started asking very wide and \nBroad questions right like show me all \nthose items over one dollar \num yeah it's like come on please don't \nkill my server \nso like now there is a way to kind of \nlike protect yourself from that in a way \nnice I love it \num do we have any guidance as to how you \ndo that one-off upgrade to to this \nbecause like why wouldn't you want that \nyeah that should that's in the dog so \nwhen you uh when you uh upgrade you can \nin configurations there is a migration \noption if you set that then your \ndatabase goes into read-only mode and \nit's basically uh generating this uh \nit's converting the old inverted index \ninto this new roaring bitmap implemented \ninverted index for at that point it's \nonly read only so you can't add anything \nto it but once it's converted then \neverything goes back to normal and you \nrealize the speed ups that are shown \nhere \nyeah Okay cool so uh some comments \nbefore we move on \num yeah so Rush sends us couple of \nrockets so uh I guess we we're going to \nthe Moon \num Euro has a question is this default \nfor new classes so if we are on 118 and \nwe create a new class \num yeah so automatically we'll get that \nright yeah \nfor new classes this is by default if \nyou're if you have a class predefined \nbefore this one then you have to migrate \nover \nperfect well you don't have to choose to \nI should say you don't have to you can \nchoose to yeah \nor even better you get to you get to \nget to right \num yeah and at the end says hi so if we \nhave like some really tough questions \nlike we could always like uh ask him you \nknow to help out or heck you know we \ncould even add him to the stream and URI \nhas a follow-up question so like how \nlong does the upgrade take so like half \na million objects do we have any idea \nanyone \nthat's it that's in a TN question I \nguess he's he's run the experiments I'm \nnot sure exactly how long the migration \nwould take \nhey let's uh let's uh pray to to tuition \nyou know you know can you send us an \nanswer \nand I hope there is not much of a delay \non the on the stream then \num yeah but uh what Etienne is thinking \nand figure out um is that is I don't \nknow if I interrupted you in the middle \nor if it was towards the end \noh no this is everything I think this is \nmy last slide yeah this is it \nall right I tie my root Interruption \nwell \nthis is super exciting and there's \nsomething by the way I want to add like \num I was talking to some um uh somebody \ninfluential like recently I don't \nnecessarily want to name them right now \num but uh like uh they were super \nexcited about roaring beatbox he was \nthey're like do you know that you'll be \nlike the first database to have half \nroaring bitmaps implemented and um it to \nme was like really impressive like \nbecause I was thinking like wow we \nreally are at the Forefront of like that \nInnovation you know like somebody came \nup with that idea uh we we discovered it \nand then uh you know Bank you know \ncouple of months later uh we have it \nimplemented in viviate and then \neverybody else can can take full \nadvantage of it you know just like just \nupgrade to the latest version \num and then upgrade your uh index and \nand here we are this is pretty amazing \nyeah what's super interesting to me I I \nwas watching the podcast with uh Conor \nand Etienne on the 1.18 release \num this is not just we're not doing it \nthe old way and then we have a roaring \nbitmap the the inverted index is \ncompletely now the internal guts are \nshifted so that it's implemented using \nthe Roaring set data structure to have \nthat radical radical of a shift and like \nthat that just shows that it's super \nNimble super flexible right we realize \nthat there's a better way to do things \nboom done like the internal guts are \ncompletely converted that's that's so \nawesome \nit's amazing that you can do that you \nknow uh without like introducing \nbreaking changes or any of that right so \num coming back to the original question \nfrom uh no no not this one oh missed it \nso like how long would this take so at \nthe end run some tests and then he \nmigrated 10 million objects and that \nthat took 10 minutes so basically and \nthat's just like on a local local \nmachine well granted a tiens machine is \nsuper powerful \num but but still it's like um you could \nsort of estimate you know half a minute \nmaybe for half a million objects so it's \nnot a not a hefty operation to do that \num that could be kind of cool \nnow there's a follow-up don't ask why I \nmigrated 10 million objects locally I \nwanted to import for a demo case of \nbitmaps but accidentally imported into \nwhat 17. \nnicely done you know living dangerously \nat the end Living Dangerously \nperfect and we get a rocket from you \nright hey we collected three rockets \ntoday like uh I hope that by the end we \nare done with the final segment we'll \nhave more Rockets even who knows \nall right \nso any other questions or should we move \non \nI take the silence as a nodding as like \nthe final segment cool so I am going to \ntake uh the final segment and I'd like \nto talk about uh the backups for Azure \nso that was like uh one of the uh sort \nof last minute thing added to to the \nrelease it was something that was a \nlittle bit in the air and we we didn't \nknow whether this is this was going to \nhappen or not \num \nbut we we managed to to add it so \nmarching our senior software engineer \num managed to implement it just like few \ndays before release so this is super \nsuper exciting so basically first of all \nwhat I want to highlight and then point \neverybody to is like that we basically \ncover the three major players uh Cloud \nplayers when it comes to uh your backup \nneeds so you can store configure with it \nto create backups for AWS for GCS and \nthen as of this release for Azure \nstorage so you could go to our \ndocumentation so it's basically under \nreference configuration and backups and \nthen you can find all the necessary \ninformation and you need you need to \nbasically know stuff like \num what is your backup Azure container \nand potentially you can add the backup \nAzure path and then basically recovering \nthe the necessary \num credentials and the environmental \nvariables so you definitely need to \nprovide like the the storage connection \nstring and your storage account uh \nalternatively yeah you could also \nprovide the storage key \num but from my understanding I haven't \ntried it myself yet and then given that \nit landed uh pretty last minute \num I wasn't able to to study just yet \nbut this is super exciting because that \nbasically means that if you are on Azure \nand then preview and then previously you \nfelt like you were missing out because \nyou couldn't set up backups on Azure \nwell now you can \num and then that this is super great and \npowerful so I hope \num people will be excited \num so this is cool and just to wrap up \nso if you're curious about this release \nuh go check out our blog post \nso basically on on the blog post if you \ngo to our site this is the the first one \nand we are covering again pretty much \nthe same details so maybe there's some \ninformation that we didn't quite get uh \ninto maybe in this session but I believe \nthat we covered most of it so you can \nlearn about all of this replication \ncursor API backups \netc etc so we cover all of this \num and and a little like a selfie shout \nif you are \num \nuh if you if you if you love wivate and \nyou want to follow what we do uh you \nshould definitely subscribe to our \nnewsletter right like uh subscribe to \nour newsletter and I also like shared \nsome uh cool things about the release uh \nbut but also like you know we give shout \nto like the community uh so this was \nreally really great to see uh this \nrelease actually took 18 different \ncontributors to happen so this is a \npretty big deal uh we had seven if I \ncan't count well \num one two three four seven new \ncontributors \num and then it was actually pretty cool \nto see like Alexander and and zenyon uh \nto uh contribute like from the go \nCommunity side which is absolutely \namazing so if in the future you don't \nwant to also miss out on Vivid air \ndefinitely subscribe to the newsletter \nbecause we'll give shouts over there uh \nand then we also share like interesting \nblog posts or podcasts and then in here \nfor example you can watch a podcast \nwith um \nEtienne and Connor that are talking \nabout it so if you want to get like the \num the perspective of the CTO on on this \nthen this could be also a good place to \ngo and learn more about it I shouldn't \nhave done that \nperfect so let me just have a one final \nlook uh on an additional note so we have \nsomething from Rush so can't wait to get \nmy hands on the new version any details \non how a WCS cluster can be upgraded to \n118. so \nit's something that I actually discussed \ninternally \num and then at the moment if you're \nusing like the freestyle boxes we don't \noffer an automated \nupgrade so if you if you do that like I \nguess the only ways at the moment is \njust create a new instance and migrate \nover your data maybe something that you \ncould use the cursor API to help you \nwith because you could like walk through \nthe data to load to read in one side and \nthen create a separate batch export to \nuh to do that maybe that could be could \nbe a way but like right now we don't \nhave like a a system to upgrade your \ninstances just yet \num and I think if you are a paying \ncustomer then probably Byron might be \nthe best person to to check out like I'm \nsure you know who Byron is if you are \npaying customer and then he'll probably \nbe able to help you \num but that's at least the story for now \nand then \netienne's final words at least it showed \nthe migration works \naround our time for re-import before the \ndemo but could migrate in time hey this \nis pretty awesome so yes it's definitely \nquicker to migrate \num well and then re-index your data \nso unless we get any final questions any \nfinal Rockets \nI think this will be the content that we \nhave for today \nwhat do you think team anything else \nfrom you \nno no \nZen is thinking \na lot of stuff was covered lots of \nimprovements \nyeah so uh okay so in this case I don't \nsee any final Rockets or any final \nquestions so thank you all very much for \nwatching this was super exciting I hope \nit was as much exciting as it for you as \nit was for me and for the team here \num and I see like uh Zen is sending us a \nwhat is it a chocolate okay \nyou're hungry okay let's uh let's wrap \nit up so thank you for watching I hope \nyou all are excited uh we are getting \nsome final Rockets So we collected six \ndollar Rockets this is a record so far \nat the end is sending us a trophy well a \ntext works as well \num thank you Carson thank you all I hope \nyou enjoy Vivid 118 and then please \nplease send us any additional questions \nover the community slacks subscribe to \nthe newsletter watch our podcast you \nknow be with us and if you have \nsomething exciting that you build with \nvv8 and you would like to join us for an \nepisode maybe next month hey uh second \nWednesday of the month we could be there \nso um yeah so thank you for watching \nthank you \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Air \u2013 Episode #6", "path": "", "link":
