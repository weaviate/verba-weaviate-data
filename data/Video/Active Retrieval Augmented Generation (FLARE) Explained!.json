{"text": "This video explains the details behind Active Retrieval Augmented Generation from Jiang et al! This is a super exciting innovation ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching weave yet on YouTube this video \nis going to dive into a super exciting \nnew paper on large language model \ngeneration titled active retrieval \naugmented generation the technique is \nalso known as flare flare is short for \nforward-looking active retrieval \naugmentation so quickly before diving \ninto it this is one of the first paper \nsummary videos on WE via YouTube so if \nyou like this kind of content please let \nus know by giving it a thumbs up hitting \nthe like button and subscribing so with \nthat said let's dive into it so here's a \nsuper quick overview of the algorithm \nflare in two minutes just in case you're \nin a hurry and you don't care about the \nexperimental details and just want the \ngist of the new algorithm so typically \nwhat we do with retrieval augmented \ngeneration is we take a query like \ngenerate a summary about Joe Biden we \nturn that into a vector and then we use \nthat to Vector search for our nearest \nneighbors or maybe you do a bm25 keyword \nsearch with this phrase to get search \nresults that help you write a summary \nabout Joe Biden so now what you're going \nto be doing in the flare forward-looking \nactive retrieval technique is \niteratively doing this retrieval wall \ngeneration not just retrieve once and \nthen generate so the way that that works \nparticularly is you have generate a \nsummary about Joe Biden uses that as the \nquery to get the search results then you \ndecode a potential first sentence from \nthe generation Joe Biden born November \n20th 1942 as the 46th president of the \nUnited States and you use that \nforward-looking generation as the \nretrieval query so then you delete this \npotential generation you just never \nactually generate it you just sample and \nsee what it would have been and then you \nuse that what it would have been as the \nsearch query to get information that \nmight be a little more relevant so you \nknow say it's going to write this is the \n46th president of the United States this \nsearch query might result in search \nresults that say you know that \nexplicitly say you know what number \nPresident Joe Biden is similarly with \nthe Next Generation Joe Biden attended a \nhallucination the University of \nPennsylvania where he earned a law \ndegree and other hallucination you use \nthis next potential sentence as the \nsearch query and then that will retrieve \nsearch results that say you know \nUniversity of Delaware Bachelor of Arts \nand history and political science so \nthere are a couple other interest \ninteresting details about just how \nparticularly you're going to sample this \nquery they ablate an implicit explicit \nquery details that we'll get into in the \npaper summary video in addition to \nexploring how to form these queries they \nalso explore when to do these queries \nparticularly when the the log \nprobability the language model put on \neach of these tokens oh sorry in the \ntheoretical generation when that is \nlower than a given threshold that's when \nyou trigger the forward-looking \nretrieval so they Benchmark this \ntechnique on four data sets that we're \ngoing to get into in the paper asqa hint \nis the same data set as sqa they compare \ntheir result of forward-looking with a \nbaseline of using the previous window as \nthe retrieval this General framework \nthat we're used to of this single time \nretrieval and then no retrieval at all \nalso in the details of the paper they \nhave a really interesting comparison of \nthis kind of technique with say search \nagents where search agents is where \nyou're prompting it to say uh you know \nopen square bracket search open uh \nuh parentheses sorry and then the search \nphrase you know that kind of search \naction thing so they have some really \ninteresting ablations really interesting \ndetails of the paper but if you want \njust a quick two minute overview \nbasically the idea is to use the \npotential next generated sentence as the \nquery to have an active retrieval whilst \ngenerating something long like an entire \nsummary of Joe Biden okay so following \nthat two minute overview of the flare \ntechnique let's kind of walk through the \nwhole basics of the story of this paper \nand the context that it lies in so we're \nstarting off with this general idea of \nretrieval augmented generation this is \nsomething that at alleviate Vector \ndatabase is super excited about this \nidea or basically what you do is you \ntake the prompt to chat gbt you turn the \nprompt into a query then you hit one of \nthese search engines and then you get \nthe documents and then you take those \ndocuments and you put that alongside the \nprompt to a large language model such as \nchat gbt and then this gives you a \ncustomized response so you don't need to \nfine-tune the large language model to \nyou know generate things particular to \nyour data you can just take these \ndocuments put it in the input and then \nthe large language model is remarkably \ngood at kind of reasoning across this \ninformation that's in the context window \nso as a quick example that I like to use \nall the time you say you ask chatgbt \nwhat is reftube reftubec is a particular \nfeature to alleviate and you know chat \ngbt says you know I don't know what ref \nto VEC is because it's not in the \ntraining data but when you do this when \nyou take this same what is ref to vac \nand you use it as a query to then hit \nthe hit a data set of the wivier blog \npost then you get this short description \nof raftavec and then by prompting it \nsaying please answer this question based \non the following context now I can tell \nyou rough to Vector over reference the \nvector is a moduleeviate 1.16 so you see \nhow this kind of retrieval augmentation \ncreates a you know an answer where the \nlanguage model can reason about your \nkind of particular information of course \nthe reasoning I'm using that just like \nhand wave I don't mean like logical \nreasoning but anyway so this is the \ngeneral idea is that you retrieve and \nthen it helps inform the generation in \nthis paper the authors are asking about \nwhat if we continually gather \ninformation throughout the generation \nprocess rather than this retrieve once \nand then generate kind of framework what \nwhat does it look like to be iteratively \nretrieving from our information as we're \ndoing some kind of generation so I think \nthis kind of class of thinking is most \nsimilar to kind of Lang chain I don't \nwant to particularly say line chain the \nsoftware library but this kind of a \ngeneral you know academic concept of you \ngenerate something and then you take the \noutput of what you generated as the \ninput to the next large language model \ncalled that kind of idea of continual \ngeneration or you do some kind of \nretrieval I think we've kind of started \nto see this thing and this paper has a \ngreat comparison of flair with the \nself-ask prompting which I think is a \nreally great uh analysis of these two \nworlds of whether you're going to kind \nof chain these language models together \nor if this is something that's cooked \ninto the first sort of generate call and \nit's not really so much as like discrete \nprompts that that are applied in some \nkind of sequence but just something that \nis a mechanism in a single generation \nbut we'll dive more into that the \nauthors ask can we create a simple and \ngeneric retrieval augmented language \nmodel that actively decides when and \nwhat to retrieve throughout the \ngeneration process so this is why I \nreally want to kind of hit this \nsimilarity between the self-asked \nprompting is we have seen this kind of \nthing before where you're you know \nprompted with some kind of tool like hey \nyou have a search agent if you want to \nuse it then open a square bracket search \nand then you know parentheses the search \nterm so it's not like the first time \nwe've seen this actively decide when and \nwhat to retrieve but I think the \nparticular mechanism with this is pretty \nunique and as mentioned they have a you \nknow they compare these two techniques \nside by side \nso then finally they draw with this kind \nof human reasoning thing I always like \nthese kind of comparisons they say \nsimilar to how humans gradually gather \ninformation as we create content such as \npapers essays or books long form \ngeneration with language models require \nGathering multiple pieces of knowledge \nthroughout the generation process so I \nreally like this because you know \nimagine that you have a prompt like you \nknow write me three paragraphs about how \nkubernetes works if you know nothing if \nyou just start with a coup with what is \nkubernetes as the query as you start \ngenerating you know you'll discover some \npocket of knowledge that you need to do \nmore research in I think as all of us \nhave done this kind of like exploration \nof new ideas you find some some sub idea \nthat you didn't originally know about \nand now you need to go down that rabbit \nhole and learn all about that thing so I \nlove this kind of comparison to thinking \nabout why we need active retrieval \naugmentation and why retrieval \naugmentation isn't just a retrieve once \nand then generate away kind of thing \nokay so now let's dive into the details \nof the algorithm so as presented in the \noriginal slide in the two-minute let's \noverview the basic idea is that we start \nwith an input query such as generate a \nsummary about Joe Biden we use a \nretrieval technique whether this be bm25 \nsearch which is what is used in the \npaper or vector search Hybrid search you \nknow search with cross encoder ranking \nor you know however you search so you \nretrieve some information with this \nquery and then you're going to use the \nyou know the d sub queue the documents \nformatted with this prompt and the query \nto to do the Next Generation so just as \na kind of a meta comment I think it's so \ninteresting how we see these papers \naround large language models are \nstarting to annotate the papers with \nprompt templates similar to how we used \nto see like pseudo code of algorithms so \nyou see like how the prompt they're like \nat least five of these prompts in the \npaper and just a detail I thought was \npretty interesting okay so it takes the \nresults and then it generates a \nhypothetical next sentence and then \nyou're going to use the the log \nprobabilities of these tokens to decide \nshould we retrieve again and then if so \nyou retrieve again and then you discard \nthe original context and you use the new \nretrieval to better inform the \nsequential generation in the active \nretrieval augmentation so the first \ninteresting thing is about when to query \nso as I think people who've made it this \nfar in the paper maybe you're familiar \nalready with large language models and \nhow particularly they generate things \nbut you know a large language model at \neach step of generation if it's \ngenerating this sentence if all tokens \nof S Prime sub T have probs greater than \nequal to Theta at each step it's you \nknow it's like if mask and then if all \nmask if all tokens mask or you know \nhowever it's tokenized it's just Word \nlevel is easy to explain quickly and \nwhat it does is it puts a probability on \nthat word token so you know it's it's \nlike a say it has a vocabulary size of \n30 000 it's doing you know 30 000 label \nclassification on classifying which of \nthe tokens is most likely to come next \nso you know it might say like if with \nyou know 90 all with like 100 or like \n99.9 then maybe like tokens has like 40 \nso all of a sudden it's like you know \nuncertain there's High entropy in the \nlabels that is predicting for this next \nMass token so when you have like you \nknow thirty percent thirty percent \nthirty percent \nthen you multiply out the probabilities \nand then you say if that's greater than \nTheta then go ahead and keep it but if \nit's less than Theta that means that we \nhave this High entropy next sentence and \nthat means that the language model is \nuncertain of it it's like this idea that \nyou can detect hallucinations by the log \nprobabilities of the tokens it's a super \ninteresting technique I don't know too \nmuch about all the literature and all \nthe tests on how that's worked but in \nthis paper that's what we're going to do \nin the paper the authors are going to be \nexperimenting with the open AI large \nlanguage models and I did not know that \nyou can do this so just showing this \nquickly maybe this will help somebody \nelse know that you can do this so \nthey're using the log probabilities from \nthese large language models so when you \nlook at a token so it also goes token by \ntoken obviously rather than word by word \nI just like word by word it's easier to \nexplain to someone quickly but so you \nknow FL the token gets 99 here then AR \nthe token gets 100 or like you know C is \nlike 99.999 so confident that you just \nsay 100 and then is only has 63.71 you \nknow so on so so this is like a sense of \nthese log probabilities really really \nreally really really interesting that \nthat openai is showing you this because \nI think originally I don't I think there \nwas something around they weren't \nshowing you this because you could use \nthis for knowledge installation there's \nlike a lot of things you could do with \nthis but anyway so I try to get an \nexample of something that's uncommon uh \nUnum unconfident not confident but \ninterestingly I guess uh they have \ntrained on ref to back so restavac used \nto be my example from opening the video \nof like something that openai doesn't \nknow about without the training without \nthe retrieval augmentation but \nand they've updated it still doesn't \nit's interesting because you can see how \nthis still isn't as good of an answer as \nwhen we had um you know given it the \ncontext from the blog post but anyway so \nwow look at that I I'm just seeing this \nnow is that you can highlight it all and \nit multiplies out the blog probability \nso this would be the log probability you \nknow for a sentence that we're comparing \nwith Theta so we you know highlight this \nand then we'd compare the log \nprobability with that Theta kind of \ninteresting but you can see like type \nhere had uh 5.19 uh that's so \ninteresting I get I guess you're also \nseeing kind of how their decoding \nalgorithm works and how the uh so you \nknow decoding also isn't generally like \ngreedy decoding where you just take the \nmaximum probability of The Next Step \nthey do things like you know beam search \nand you know this kind of stuff for how \nthey uh how they decode so it's not \nalways just the most probable next token \nanother interesting detail if you're \ngetting into the weeds of exactly how to \ndecode from large language models so \nanyways I think you get the high level \nidea that you're looking at the \nconfidence by multiplying out these \nprobabilities and that's how you're \ndetermining when to actively retrieve so \nthe next ablation of the paper is quite \ninteresting as well which is how to \nquery so you know we've we've taken this \nnext sentence Joe Biden attended the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania where he \nearned a law degree this had you know \nHigh entropy and we're saying no we need \nto actively retrieve with this so then \nthe question is do you do an implicit \nquery it's an implicit query the the you \nknow the naive way to do it would just \nbe take this sentence and use that \nexactly as the query what they propose \nis masking out the uh the tokens \nparticularly that have the high uh \nentropy so you know this phrase the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania if we go back \nto the open AI playground we'd imagine \nthat this phrase is highlighted in red \nand some of it with law degree so we'd \nyou know we'd hope these hallucinations \nare highlighted in red I'm not exactly \nsure if that works completely for \ndetecting all hallucinations but \nyou know so the idea is you take the \nhigh uncertain phrases and you mask them \nout such that the query is Joe Biden \nattended mask where he earned mask or \nmaybe just deleting it to the sentence \nbecomes Joe Biden attended where he \nearned but that might lose a little bit \nof the um I don't know maybe like the \ngrammar of it but anyway so so you use \nthis as the query to then retrieve \ninformation about uh Delaware and it's a \nreally clever idea because if you use \nthe University of Pennsylvania is the \nquery maybe you'll end up getting more \ninformation about the University of \nPennsylvania say you're searching \nWikipedia or something so this kind of \nidea of masking out the uncertain \nphrases is quite interesting then the \nother idea is do you have an explicit \nquery where you kind of map it into the \nquery space so you know like like into a \nnatural question so ask a question to \nwhich the answer is the University of \nPennsylvania and then the you know \nanother large language model but then \nnow I you might be saying oh my you know \nusing another large language model to \ngenerate each of the queries is going to \nget expensive but you know you assume \nmaybe you could have some task specific \nmodel for this that generates queries \ngiven phrases like this but you know \nthat that kind of thing but so what \nuniversity did Joe Biden attend what \ndegree did Joe Biden earn you turn these \ninto explicit questions to retrieve \nthings and it's a pretty interesting \nidea you can also have this zero shot \nquestion generation you have the user \ninput so far the generated output so far \nand then given the above passage ask a \nquestion to which the answer is the term \nentity phrase and then say you know the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania so all of \nthese kind of interesting ways of how \nyou form the query that you're going to \nbe sending to the retrieval engine \nand then so just this little detail this \nis about when to mask in the implicit \nquery but what you see at the end is as \nwe'll get into the evaluation results \nthey don't actually seem to find a like \na you know a difference between the \nimplicit explicit query so maybe this is \njust something that's interesting to \ntalk about you well I mean what \nuniversity did Joe Biden attend compared \nto Joe Biden attended mask or your mask \nit looks like they perform similarly on \nthe you know on how they measure that in \nthis paper but I think we'll get more \ninto the benchmarking but it's hard to \nit's hard to say if these benchmarks are \ngoing to generalize to you know the app \nYou're Building you know you're building \nan app with leviate and uh you know an \nopen Ai and stuff is this is this \nparticular thing going to hold to your \nresults I don't I'd say try it out and \nsee how it works for your particular \nthing so I think that's a really good \ntransition into how did they measure \nthis what are the experiments that were \nrun so let's start off with the Baseline \napproaches so the the strong bass line \nis to use the previous window sentence \nas flare query well I'd call it a strong \nbass line because it's sort of like an \nobvious ablation the next thing is \nprobably the strong based on like the \ncurrent state of the art sort of way of \nthinking about this but using the \nprevious window sentence is the flare \nquery I think the benefit of this is you \ndon't have to do that kind of extra \ngeneration where you do the \nforward-looking step and then you query \nwith the forward-looking step if you \njust use the previous previous sentence \nthen you know if you think about overall \nhow many large language model calls \nyou're making that might reduce that \nkind of thing but so that's the Baseline \nthen we're going to get into self-ask \nprompting how that's different from this \ntechnique and then they also have a a \nvariant on self-ass prompting called \nflare indirect \nso previous window sentence uh you know \npretty straightforward window meaning \nthat you use a token window where you're \ncounting the tokens for the you know the \nprevious sentences that are used as a \nquery whereas sentences you use the \nheuristic of splitting on you know \nperiods exclamation marks question marks \nto you know say that this is a sentence \nand then send that as the query so this \nresult is quite interesting they're \nshowing that using the next sentence \ncompared to the previous sentence gives \na pretty high uh you know Improvement on \nexact match F1 Precision recall of a \nmulti-hop question answering data set \nthis is where you multi-have question \nanswering we'll get into it more quickly \nbut I think maybe you might want to have \na quick explanation as you're looking at \nthis that's where you have to uh combine \nlike two sources of information so if \nit's did Aristotle use a laptop you have \nto first know when did Aristotle live \nwhen were laptops invented and then PSAT \ntogether into a short answer and the \nshort answer is short answers are great \nbecause then these exact match F1 \nmetrics are pretty good whereas you know \nasqa I I think it's either long form \nquestion answering or open domain \nsummarization where you generate a \nreally long answer so these metrics are \na little they're a little more difficult \nto really like capture the quality of \nthe generated response compared to the \ngold annotation but anyways so what they \nfind that's interesting is Boom huge \nresult by using the Next Generation as \nthe query which is you know that's kind \nof the whole idea of this so definitely \nbefore reading this paper and I still \nthink this is a very interesting \ntechnique self-ask prompting was \ndefinitely probably the you know the \nactive retrieval augmentation that's how \nI I would think of it personally so the \nidea behind self-ass prompting is when \nyou have a question like who lived \nlonger Theodore Hager or Harry Von \nWatkins you prompt it with are follow-up \nquestions needed here and then if the \nlanguage model outputs yes you then have \nfollow-up and then you have the language \nmodel generate the follow-up question \nhow old was Theodore haker when he died \nintermediate answer and then so it will \nyou know retrieve with this and then it \nwill I always imagine that this kind of \ncould work asynchronously as well where \nyou could have the follow-up question \nand then maybe do it but say that you do \nthis sequentially where then \nintermediate answer Theodore haker was \n65 years old when he died and then you \nhave the next token so it could either \nbe you know so or follow so you look at \nthese two follow-up or so and so if it's \nfollow up then you know another search \nquery then another intermediate answer \nand then so the final answer is Harry \nVon Walken so this kind of idea of uh \nself-ass question decomposition has been \nquite interesting where you ask the \nlanguage model hey you know is this \nquestion too confusing to just like \nretrieve once and then generate or do \nyou want to break this into sub \nquestions and then have each of those \nquestions answered so this is a pretty \nstrong Baseline it's really interesting \nthat they're kind of putting these two \nalgorithms side by side and then you \nknow seeing what happens so sort of \nsimilarly to prompting the language \nmodel to our follow-up questions needed \nhere we also have this idea of search \nactions and when we prompt the agents to \nuse these tools this is this is the \nwhole idea behind tool use you know like \nthe chat gbt Marketplace or say like \nLang chain llama Index this idea or the \nreact paper is another really great one \nwhere you tell it hey you have like wolf \nfrom alpha to trigger it say you know \nopen square bracket you know calculator \nand then this expression and then it \nwill execute it and you'll see the \noutput so so the idea of how you would \ndo this with search is you you know open \nsquare bracket search you know Joe Biden \nUniversity and then you get the results \nJoe Biden University and then you know \nso like a keyword search that kind of \nthing so so this is another really \ninteresting bass on there comparing it \nwith interestingly they're going to \ncouple these skills so so this is this \nis the idea of skills tools I kind of \npersonally think of skills and tools as \nsimilar things well skills is like you \nwould have like a collection of prompts \nsort of that like are like describing \nhow to prompt a summarization or how to \nprompt like a grammatical editing of \nsomething this kind of idea whereas \ntools you think a little differently is \nlike you connect to some kind of \nexternal thing so skill one would be \nlike an external tool and skill two \nwould be like an internal thing so skill \none and instruction to guide language \nmodels to generate search queries and \nthen you have search related exemplars \nlike examples so few shot learning has \nbeen you know prior to the uh instruct \ngbt the you know the rlhf and all that \nthe whole idea of language models was \nthat you would have to give it like four \nor five examples of the task and then it \ncould fuse shot in context learn the \ntask from those examples it was \nabsolutely remarkable that it was able \nto do this I don't mean to downsell the \nability of this but so a lot of this \ntool use stuff people are still thinking \nabout prompting it to uh you know \nprompting it how to use the tool so for \nexample if I'm you know if I'm trying to \nprompt my large language model to write \nweva queries or write weeviate schema \nsay I would give it like a couple \nexamples of what we gave schemas look \nlike and then it could attend to that \nand then learn the skill of how to write \na schema or how to write a weba query so \nwhat they're doing is they give it some \nexamples of when it used a search term \nto get a better result similarly it \ngives it examples of um \nyou know multi-hop question answering so \nmulti-hop question answering this kind \nof what the task related examples are \nare like this these kind of examples of \ndecomposition which is needed for \nmulti-hop multi-hop is the whole idea of \num you have to like compose facts you \ncan't just have one answer you you know \nyou decompose so did erisa or who live \nlonger at the example on the screen is \nlike you know okay how long did this guy \nlive how long did this guy live and \nthat's how you would reason about who \nlive longer so so this is the prompt \na little bit of an interesting detail is \nthat in their algorithm they introduce a \nbit of extra control by explicitly \nboosting the probability of the open uh \nbracket when they want it to search and \nthen or you know down weighting it when \nthey when it's just completed a search \nand you don't want it to search again \nyou're like you know generate you just \nsearched so to dive a little further \ninto what this looks like uh prompting \nlarge language models to have the skill \nof using a search API as well as the \nskill of thinking step by step so the \nauthors they showed the like how they \nprompted with this for uh the so they \nhave four data sets that explore you \nknow two Wiki multi-hop QA strategy QA \nand asqa so uh so let's look at this \nquickly so you know what what you do is \nuh you you have this kind of this again \nis how you search you have this it tells \nyou to do this action and then as you're \ndecoding from the language model if you \nsee it do this you know open square \nbracket and then you know you're looking \nfor this kind of thing if you see like \nthese two in sequence that's usually how \nyou would decode a tool use sort of \nbecause you could have other kinds of \ntools like calculator or python code \nexecutor or you know any kind of \nexternal API all these ideas so so you \nknow you give it some examples of but \nwhat are the risks during production of \nNano materials and so answer with search \nsearch nanomaterial production risk so \nso you give it a few examples of how to \nuse search for some kind of you know \ninformation heavy query like metformin \nis the first line drug for what so then \nyou have these examples of thinking step \nby step so this is this Chain of Thought \nprompting that has been super effective \nis uh showing the language models how to \nkind of break down a question so one of \nthe director of the film of the film \nhypocrite film die so the film hypocrite \nwas directed by Miguel Mora Ada Miguel \nmoreta died on 19 June so you know \nyou're showing it how to take apart \nthese questions and particularly when \nyou're doing this task of multi-hop \nquestion answering \nthis is a really useful skill to have so \nso then you kind of combine it by just \nanswer with step by step in search with \nthe new question and then you know you \ngive it a little more prom now combine \nthe aforementioned two skills first \nwrite out the reasoning steps then draw \nthe conclusion where the reasoning steps \nshould also utilize the search API you \nknow search whenever possible so so it's \nkind of interesting how you're then \ncombining these skills in the end you \nnotice that the few shot props data \nthese don't have search in them so \ninteresting detail to this okay so \nso then you know you have all these \nexamples so \nanother interesting thing is whether you \nwant to retrieve you shot examples is an \ninteresting idea I haven't really dived \nit into it too much but just something \nto know is you might want to retrieve \nfew shot examples that are similar in \nthe semantic space to the current input \nnot sure how well that works so here's \nanother example of the strategy QA so \ngenerate yes or no to the font question \ndo hamsters provide food for any animals \nand then you show it how to do this kind \nof step-by-step reasoning and then the \nfinal answer is no so so strategy QA is \nmaybe the best Benchmark we have in this \npaper because it is going to be yes no \nat the end of it which the reason I say \nthat's the best Benchmark is because \nthen you can easily do the metrics I \nthink like you know exact match of \nquestion answering is a bit tough \nbecause you could you know phrase the \ncorrect answer in multiple ways for a \nlot of questions that's kind of the \nwhole idea behind that asqa data set \nthey explore is that uh if you say like \nuh where is the where did the \nPhiladelphia Eagles play you could you \ncould have like different granularities \nof how you answer that like you could \nname the stadium that they play in you \ncould name like the city they play in \nthat kind of thing so so yeah so I like \nthe yes note anyways so the point of \nthis is here are examples of what these \nproblems look like for how you prompt it \nto use skills and how to kind of do this \nfew shot reasoning so what I would say \nthat people taking away from this if \nyou're you know building out so say \nweeviate and large language models is \nthat for your task it probably makes \nsense and you can probably boost the \nperformance a little bit \nby having these kind of few shot \nexamples of a skill but then there's the \ntrade-off of uh you know of the input \nwindow length so there's we'll talk \nabout this at the end there's a lot of \nhype now about the Mosaic 65 000 input \nwindows or the anthropic 100 000 input \nwindows and so what that might let you \ndo is really pack the inputs with all \nsorts of information a ton of these \nexamples of how to use skills as well as \nretrieval augmentation it is so exciting \nthis idea of longer input windows but as \nof right now most of the most of the \ncases of large language models and all \nthose models they're probably going to \nbe expensive or not as strong as the \nmodels that are trained densely with the \n4096 token like so right now you should \nbe mindful of how long these are going \nto end up being in your prompts okay so \none of the most interesting details of \nthe paper are what data sets did they \nuse to say that this retrieval augmented \ngeneration technique is you know better \nthan another so we have four long form \nknowledge intensive generation tasks \nslash you know data sets for \nbenchmarking these kind of systems first \nup we have two Wiki multi-hop QA this \nyou know multi-hop question answering \nmulti-hub question answering Common \nSense reasoning long form question \nanswering your open domain summarization \nthese are broadly described as tasks in \ndeep learning literature meaning that \nthey follow a similar kind of input \noutput framework such that you could you \nknow you have multiple data sets kind of \ndomains that follow this sort of \nannotation interface so multiphap QA \nmeans that you're combining you know at \nleast two facts to form the final answer \nyou know again who lived longer this guy \nor that guy you need to combine the two \nfacts of when they each lived strategy \nQA Common Sense reasoning quite an \ninteresting Benchmark for getting like \nsort of sort of say like the general \nWorld understanding of these language \nmodels that's where you you know you ask \na question like will an apple float in \nwater or like what happens if I toss an \napple up in the air so that kind of like \nCommon Sense physics like density and \ngravity so you know it's things like \nthis like you know that kind of General \nsanity the language model so to say asqa \nis long form question answering and then \nWiki ASP is open domain summarization so \nthese two data sets are quite difficult \nto measure the final result of so you \nknow if I tell you to write me an eli5 \nsummary of I don't know the density \nthing like how does density work what \nwhatever the question is like what's \nwhat's the summary of this paper that \nwe're talking about it's going to be \nhard to exactly compare the generated \nsummary with say like the human \nannotated or self-supervised \nbootstrapped gold summary so you know \nsay you're doing the long form question \nanswering of what is active retrieval \naugmented generation about that's the \nquestion and then you need to write like \na paragraph and say you compare that \nwith the abstract of this paper as the \nground truth what you would do is you do \nthings like engram overlap you know how \nmany uh tokens between the generated \nanswer to that question of what is this \npaper about and then the abstract how \nmany of those tokens do they share and \nthen that's kind of like what exact \nmatch that's what F1 Precision recall \nthey all capture that kind of thing but \nwe're gonna get into a couple \ninteresting metrics they use as well \nlike uh disam ambiguated uh are \ndisambiguated uh question answering as \nwell as this uni eval for you know maybe \nputting them into Vector spaces and \nusing semantic vectors to compare \ngenerated responses with ground truth a \nlot of interesting ideas there so \nstarting off with two Wiki multi-hop QA \nthe way that these multi-hop question \nanswering data sets are constructed is \ntypically use the notion of relational \ntuples so similar to you know like uh \ngraph database technology where you have \nentity relation object you're going to \ntake out those kind of triples and then \nyou try to you know chain them together \nwith some maybe like a transitive \nproperty or something like that so so \nyou're keeping these uh triples so this \nis like the transitive thing where you \nhave you know a relation b b relation C \nso then a relation C stuff like that so \nyou extract these relational tuples and \nthen you chain them together and kind of \ntranslate them into natural language and \nthen that's kind of like that's like how \nthey create these data sets to Benchmark \nhow well systems can do this like \nlogical chaining of facts but but then \nnot in the you know that most of these \nsystem like a baseline of how you would \ndo this would be translate the \nparagraphs from the retrieved evidence \ninto all these tuples and then you know \nmaybe have like some intermediate step \nof chaining the tuples but generally \nwe're trying to see if the language \nmodel can just do it without That \nexplicit kind of relational extraction \nso this is kind of a look at what kind \nof things the multi-hop reasoning uh \nCompares so you know comparison question \nyou have these relations like you know \nyou would parse this out into a relation \nlike lived lived is the relation for \nthis song and then you have comparison \nwho lived longer when they share that \nkind of relation you might need some \nkind of diction like dictionary of what \nrelations you can stack like this so \ncompositional question is inferring the \nbridge entity to find the answer so why \ndid the founder of versus die so you \nneed to bridge this concept of versus \nwas the founder of uh or Gianni Versace \nwas the founder of versus and then he \ndied like this so you need to bridge \nthat relation \nanyway so this is this is the idea \nbehind these multi-help question \nanswering data sets so it looks like the \nstrategy QA data set which is labeled as \ncommon sense reasoning has a similar \nkind of uh strategy for construction as \nmost of these multi-hop question \nanswering data sets with a key \ndifference being that all the answers \nare collapsed to yes no uh it seems like \nthere's another interesting detail to \nthis which is about implicit facts and \nthen or this kind of like multi-step and \nthen implicit properties of the strategy \nquestions \nso as an example you would say are \nsharks faster than crabs and for this \none you explicitly need the reasoning \nsteps of how fast their sharks how fast \nare crabs and then is one thousand two \nwhereas if you ask it something like are \nmore watermelons grown in Texas than in \nAntarctica you might not even need to \nbreak that up into the steps because you \nyou can just say like you know the \nAntarctica doesn't support growing \nwatermelons so that's kind of the idea I \ndidn't dive too much into the details of \nthis but maybe if you're interested in \npausing this or Consulting the paper \nitself to find out exactly how this kind \nof data set is constructed but I \ninterpreted it to be similar to \nmulti-hop question answering with the \nyes no and then yeah maybe something \nelse for how particularly they say that \nthese this is common sense like I'm \ncurious like you know would Hayes and \nOsiris hypothetically compete for real \nestate in the Underworld well okay so so \nyeah that's common sense because real \nestate in the Underworld I don't know I \nmean anyway so so the data set this is \nwhat it's trying to capture how well the \nlanguage models do and you know however \nyou set up the system to answer these \nkind of questions so the next data set \nis measuring a long form question \nanswering is asqa which stands for \nanswer summaries for questions that are \nambiguous so basically the idea is if \nyou ask a question like who is the ruler \nof France until August 2nd 1830th and \nthere were two rulers of France during \nthis time so so you could kind of have \neither like the summary could say either \nthing and kind of be correct so so it's \nabout kind of disambiguation it's a you \nknow pretty interesting annotation data \nset so uh yeah so that's as much as I \nreally looked into this doing this kind \nof thing of answering these questions \nthe the general thing I'd say to take \naway is that it's you have an annotation \nof long-form answers I guess it's all \nit's further compounded by this this \nambiguation part of the data set so you \nknow definitely interesting if you're \nkind of doing a tour of all these data \nsets so then rounding out our tour of \nthe data sets used in this paper we have \nWiki ASP so Wiki ASP is aspect based \nsummarization so the key is you know if \nyou say write me a summary about Barack \nObama that's pretty vague compared to \nwhere if you break it into write me a \nsummary about Barack Obama's early life \nand career Barack Obama's presidency or \nBarack Obama's Legacy so you have this \nkind of notion of a particular aspect \nbased summary so you you know you kind \nof reduce the search space of the \nsummarization and what it could entail \nand I think that's a pretty interesting \ndetail for how you construct these you \nknow long summarization data sets so all \nin all here is a summary of the \nevaluation data set so even when they \nhave more than 500 examples they will \nsubset the data set to 500 which in the \npaper they describe is about the cost of \nrunning these experiments you know \nobviously these large language model \ninferences aren't cheap and you want to \nablate the um like the impact of \nprevious next the particular Alpha \nparameter for the um \nyou know Alpha parameter for when to use \nthe next sentence as retrieval as well \nas a beta parameter for the masking on \nthe implicit query so anyways it's like \nas you want to Blade all these details \nyou can't be doing it with like 200 000 \nquestions so you know we have the \nmetrics that are used and then the \nCorpus using Wikipedia for three the \nopen web and the Bing search engine for \nthe wiki thing uh and then using you \nknow bm25 or like some kind of search \nengine configuration so say it's like a \nhybrid search say it's like a you know \nbm25 Vector search Hybrid search but \nthen also you have like symbolic \nfeatures that boost it like you know \nwhat time the article was these are all \nthe kind of things that would be like \nabstracted into a search engine like \nBing or if we imagine kind of putting \nweeviate into into the retriever here we \nV8 would be more like that where you you \ncould you can bm25 with it you can also \nlike combine all sorts of things for \nranking search results uh so then the \ntop case how many of the results are put \ninto the prompt so two three three five \nthe number of examples that are used \nwhen you're giving it examples of how to \nthink step by step for a given task and \nthen whether you're doing that or not so \nyou only do the thinking step-by-step \nexamples for the multi-hop question \nanswering data set \nokay evaluation metrics so exact match \nis you know what is the atomic number of \noxygen eight is the answer and then does \nit exactly match that so this is the \nthing where yeah so you know that kind \nof thing take it how you will it's it's \na pretty good metric for a question \nanswering when it's a short answer and \nit's something like eight that's a \npretty good example but if it's \nsomething that could be more abstract I \nthink it's a it's not the it's a metric \nthat could use a little work it works \ngreat for when you have yes no exact \nmatch so you know with strategy QA you \nsay so the final answer is yes no and \nthen you can exact match it you know and \nthen it's just like you know binary \nclassification so token level F1 named \nentity F1 so F1 is uh like a Precision \nrecall waiting so uh you know Precision \nrecall these are like um these are like \nfalse positive metrics generally where \nuh Precision is saying like how many of \nthe correct entities were were generated \nand then recall is like how many of our \nPrecision is how many of of the \ngenerated named entities are correct and \nthen recall is how many of the correct \nnamed entities were generated and then \nan F1 score is a is like Precision times \nrecall over Precision plus recall some I \nthink it's like a geometric mean of \nthose two metrics so token level F1 is \nwhere you do that for each of the tokens \nin the um in the gold answer and the \nname entity is where you only do that \nfor the named entities in the gold score \nso the gold summary is the human \nannotated they or just like the source \nof Truth where if it's like you know \nBarack Obama was the 45th president of \nthe United States and then so you you \ndis named entity F1 you disregard was \nthe and you just use Barack Obama or \nlike 45th those kind of things so then \nuh Rouge is this like \nyou know Rouge is like the blue score \nBleu where it's like it's like a way of \ndoing engram overlap between long \npassages of text so \nso yeah so that's that's basically what \nit is uh so disambiguate F1 uh so what \nyou do with this is you generate a \nsummary so you generate the the long \nsummary or the long answer to the \nquestion and then you apply an \nextractive question answering model like \nRoberta on that and you see if it can \nget out the uh the the like the name \nentities I think from the generated \nsummary and so you have that kind of \nlike intermediate of you evaluate the \ngenerated summary by applying a uh like \nan extractive question answering model \non it and seeing what it is able to get \nout of that uh and then we have this uni \neval thing which I think is interesting \nenough to get its own slide so for \nexample when Google was evaluating their \nMinerva chatbot originally they had all \nthese different dimensions of how they \nevaluated the chat pod chatbot like how \nentertaining is it how factually correct \nis it so you have these like dimensions \nof evaluation similarly we had this \npaper called checklist which was like \nyou know it was more of like a \nrobustness test like does it do well \nwhen you add negations when you swap \nnamed entities so it's like a checklist \nof General language understanding and \nthat's kind of I'd say uni eval to me \nlooks like checklist kind of where so \nyou take the generated summary and you \nhave these different dimensions that \nyou've trained task specific evaluation \nmodels they describe more about how this \nis unsupervised so you know I didn't get \ninto details of that but I highly \nrecommend checking that out so you say \nbasically you know how coherent is this \nsummary you know if you're evaluating \nlong form or open domain summarization \nor like is this summary relevant to the \nreference so you know looking at these \ndifferent dimensions of a summary \noutputting the score and so yeah a \npretty interesting way of looking at \nlike multiple linguistic properties of \nthis generated summary so pretty \ninteresting evaluation technique for \nthese long you know when you generate \nlike a paragraph of text how are you \ngoing to evaluate that so follow in the \ndescription of the algorithm what \nthey're going to be ablating the data \nsets and then the metrics let's get into \nthe results that they find so starting \noff with this is kind of the opening \nresult where you compare the flare \ntechnique with previous window retrieval \nshown in yellow and then single \nretrieval so retrieve once and then \ngenerate so we get a huge benefit on \nmulti-hop question answering of the 51 \nwith the exact match so you know exact \nmatch of that final question of that \nfinal answer 51 compared to 39 which is \na pretty big Improvement uh the strategy \nQA doesn't seem to be as much of an \nimprovement than the asqa you know \npretty minor there as well but when you \nhave the hint so the hint is where you \ngive it the disambiguation like the \nsummary should be about this particular \nwho uh like King of France in that \nexample from earlier and then you know \nperforming about the same on the aspect \nbased summarization but probably the \nmost interesting test in my view is the \nmulti-hop question answering because \nit's probably the most well understood \nuh you know data set and metrics for \nthis kind kind of thing so this ability \nof the active retrieval to have this \nImprovement when you're kind of trying \nto like answer these complex questions \nthat require retrieving from multiple \nsources or like asking new questions \nwhile you're generating that's quite an \ninteresting Improvement probably the \nreal question here though is how well \ndoes flare compare with self-ask \nprompting where you explicitly prompt it \nour follow-up questions needed here you \nknow yes and then follow-up questions so \nwe do get a better result with flair it \ndoesn't seem to be a super you know way \nbetter kind of result but it's \ndefinitely interesting to think about \nwhat's more efficient between you know \nlooking at the log probabilities of the \nnext token doing that returning the log \nprobabilities it's very interesting as \nwe saw earlier that now open AI is \nletting you see that and you know and \nthen so it's going to be super quick to \njust multiply those together and then \nsay if it's less than the threshold you \nknow compared to the our follow-up \nquestions needed which is more of a \nblack box algorithm so it's pretty \ninteresting when you use the log \nprobabilities to do this active \nretrieval or whether you just kind of \nblack box it and prompt it to ask it if \nit wants follow-up retrieval so you know \nthere are definitely a lot of \ninteresting questions this is this is \nprobably the debate that I think is the \nmost interesting with this of the future \nof this kind of active retrieval \naugmentation so some additional details \nthey explore they also look you know \ndoing this across the data set so this \nis again this is again showing you more \nof the details behind how these plots \nare produced so you see the different \nmetrics and these different data sets no \nretrieval single retrieval or the \nprevious window so flare performing the \nbest but you know not too much on these \nother data sets which is pretty \ninteresting but but again these data \nsets they're you know asqa and Wiki ASP \nas we saw these are like these long \ngeneration benchmarks and so I don't \nreally think we have the greatest \nstandardization of data sets and metrics \nfor that kind of thing yet \nuh so then what they're ablating is when \nto retrieve so this this would be an \ninteresting hyper parameter if you \nimagine as we build this into alleviate \nyou'd have some kind of hyper parameter \ncalled like Theta like similar to the um \nthe alpha in weaves hybrid search where \nthe Theta is saying when like what \nthreshold of uncertainty to do this \nextra retrieval in \nso what they find is between 40 to 60 \npercent uh uncertainty works the best \nand more than that they find to be \nactually distracting because you're now \nlike retrieving every single time you \ngenerate something and they find that \nthat doesn't work as well as some \noptimal intermediate value of uh \ncertainty another really interesting \ndetail they explore is that idea of \nmasking the implicit query so when \nthey're going to be doing that implicit \nquery idea which if I can find the slide \nthis is this idea of you you know you \ntake the query is going to be just the \nnext sentence and then you're going to \nbe masking out the uncertain words and \nthen you have a hyper parameter of with \nwhat log of probability do you uh mask \nout the word so they find a bit of a \nvariance with this so you know you know \nnot mattering too much but showing that \nthis 40 thing I guess is the best with \nmasking out those tokens that you send \nthat over so after reading this paper \nhere are some of the reflections that I \nhad on this General concept of active \nretrieval augmented generation and \nparticularly this algorithm so \nparticular to this algorithm I'm very \ncurious about sort of the generalization \nof alphago mu zero this kind of like \ntree search look ahead with text \ngeneration so one idea would be you know \nas you're decoding the next sentence in \nlanguage models you could have several \ndifferent potential next sentences that \nhave a pretty high total probability so \nI think it'd be very interesting to you \nknow Branch out this retrieval augmented \ngeneration and have it go along these \nseparate branches of the tree to do \nthese generations and then you know at \nthe end so you have the you know the \nforward look ahead kind of the Monte \nCarlo tree search exactly how it is in \nalphago and the game playing AI is where \nyou you know you're looking ahead to \ngenerate and then you kind of see how \nthat works at the end so I think it's \nvery interesting to see that kind of \nlook ahead search in text generation so \nthe second thing I think is really \ninteresting is just large language model \nevaluation I'm very very interested in \nthis um in this software framework \ncalled chat Arena there's another one \nfrom UC Berkeley that I don't remember \noff the top of my head but basically the \nidea is that language models are given \nlike an ELO rating similar to like like \nvideo games where they chat with each \nother and then you have like a third \nlanguage model to decide like okay he or \nthat language model was smarter in this \nuh debate or conversation so it's I \nthink it's a very interesting way to \nevaluate language models it's you know \nmore hand wavy than the benchmarks where \nyou annotate you know ground truth and \ncompare it but I think it's a little \nmore realistic for how people are you \nknow using these kind of systems and \nit'll be very interesting to see how \nthat kind of evaluation work evolves so \nas kind of my analysis of the paper was \nI think when you have short answer \nquestions and you can do exact match \nlike the multi-hop question answering I \nthink you get a really great Benchmark \nfor that kind of thing and then what \nthese benchmarks can do is they capture \nthe long tail well you can see like the \nfailure modes when you create like a \nhundred thousand examples and then run \nit and then you can see like okay it's \nbad at this particular distribution of \nquestions what's the similarity and then \nyou can maybe add data to fix it that \nway but I think more so this broad like \nchat with each other who wins the chat \nor like I don't know I think the space \nsome evaluating language models also \nevolving is in a very interesting way \nthe third thing I think is extremely \ninteresting is just this continued \ndevelopment of large language models so \nfirstly we're seeing the latest news is \nanthropic has a 100 000 inputs and then \nyou know Mosaic ml they have their MPT \nwhich is 65 000. so \nyou know I think that we're going to be \nable to retrieve so much information to \nput in the context and you know I you \ncould say that I'm biased by working at \na vector database and saying this but I \nthink it's unlikely that the best way to \nretrieve is just to put like some \nmassive document of the same context \ninto the window I think there's still \nNuance to how do we use retrieval so you \nknow is the best way to say it's not the \ngreatest specific question but when \nyou're asking that question of uh where \ndid Joe Biden what what degree did Joe \nBiden do should you just look at the \nentire Wikipedia article or maybe yeah \nit's not a good example but like every \nlittle passage from everything on the \ninternet about Joe Biden's experience in \ncollege if that makes sense like if \nyou're looking at the thing of like what \nis reftubec how do I use it for my app \nrather than just taking the one blog \npost from we've ate on rustavec if you \nlook at like these Snippets like code \nretrieving from every code base just \nlike you know retrieval from everything \nthat uses ref I still think that's a \nbetter way to like pack the problem with \ninformation and then I also think this \n100K and inputs it'll be very \ninteresting how that kind of skill \ndescription so we saw these like few \nshot examples of how to use a skill like \nyou know compositional reasoning so \nyou'll be able to pack in like a ton of \nexamples of how to use skills and it'll \nbe interesting to see if that kind of \nlike search action gets better with \ngiving it like I don't know 20 examples \nof how to search but and then I also \nthink this Laura thing is people are \nfine-tuning their models and their \ndomains that's just another really \ninteresting thing to be looking at how \nwill that impact retrieve augment to \ngeneration \nso then just the final thing of how do \nwe use retrieval I'm pretty curious \nabout like yeah just generally like um \nyou know when it's retrieving so that \nthis is the first this is one of the \nfirst things we're seeing on like this \nlike active retrieval you don't just \nretrieve one so yeah it's very \ninteresting like as we have this kind of \nlike Auto gbt style you come up with an \naction plan when in the action plan are \nyou going to do more retrievals and I \nthink it's this is very interesting that \nthis kind of like we like this idea of \ngenerative feedback loops where you save \nintermediate Generations as well so like \nwhen would you then want to retrieve \nsome kind of intermediate generation as \nyou're like in the middle of executing \nsome wildly complex task so anyway so so \nhere are some takeaways I hope you find \nthis interesting thank you so much for \nwatching this explanation of active \nretrieval augmented generation the flare \ntechnique uh please check out wevia on \nweave.io
