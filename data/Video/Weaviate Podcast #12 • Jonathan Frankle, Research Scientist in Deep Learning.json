{"text": "Please check out Composer from MosaicML! https://github.com/mosaicml/composer Jonathan Frankle is the Chief Scientist at ... \n[Music] \nthank you so much for checking out the \nwva podcast we've had a lot of great \nguests in the wv8 podcast but i'm super \nexcited about our next guest we have \njonathan frankel from mosaic ml jonathan \nis one of my favorite research \nscientists and deep learning to follow \nalong with since the debut of his paper \nalongside michael carbon his advisor at \nmit the lottery ticket hypothesis this \npaper i won an iclr best paper and it \nwas just an incredible finding about the \nability to apply these sparse mass onto \nthese sub-networks and this kind of idea \nof pruning and how you can kind of \nachieve this training of the sparse sub \nnetwork from scratch is theoretically \npossible and now jonathan has continued \nthis research developing all sorts of \nthings related to efficiency and \nefficient deep learning algorithms \nexploring the benefits of things like \nmasking with pruning and all these kinds \nof things that jonathan will explain to \nyou better than i will in this quick \nintro but i'm so excited to learn more \nabout jonathan's latest company uh \nmosaic ml and the product composer and \nfor our weev8 community this is super \ninteresting because you know they're \nmaking it more efficient faster cheaper \nto train models and then we get our \nvector embeddings that we can search \nthrough for semantic similarity and all \nsorts of things so jonathan thank you so \nmuch for coming on the wba podcast and \nuh can you tell us about mosaic and ml \nand maybe what i've watched in my quick \nintro no no this is great so \nthe story of mosaic ml goes back almost \ntwo years now \nand really it started with an email from \nour now ceo naveen rao to me and my \nadvisor saying hey nice lottery ticket \npaper i want to do a start up based on \nthat \num and my first reaction anybody's \nreaction who knows the lottery ticket \npaper well should be are you insane \ninteresting science not useful um and \nyou know i'm willing to admit that you \nknow this work is not practically useful \nit was meant to be an exploration into \nunderstanding deep learning but \nin order to use lottery ticket \npractically you would need two things to \nbe true \nnumber one is you need some magic way to \nfind sparse networks early in training \nthe work is all about showing that these \nsparse networks exist but it doesn't \nshow an efficient way to find them and \npeople have been working on this problem \nin the literature but in my mind there \nhasn't been a ton of progress to be \ncompletely honest and i can say more \nabout my thoughts on that in a moment \nthe other piece is that suppose you \nfound one of these sub-networks \nyou need to train efficiently when you \nhave a sparse network and you know for \nthose who aren't familiar \njust because a network has fewer \nparameters doesn't mean it trains faster \nthe network will hypothetically require \nfewer compu fewer calculations fewer \nfloating point operations to be able to \ntrain but that doesn't make it go fast \nbecause our hardware can't actually take \nadvantage of the topology of the network \ngpus and modern tpus and hardware like \nthat can't take advantage of sparsity \nvery effectively it's used to processing \nyou know contiguous matrices or tensors \nor vectors \nso i kind of looked at this email you \nknow getting back to the topic i looked \nat this email from davina went is he \nnuts like this is a pretty smart guy \num but we got to talking you know my \nadvisor and i sat down and talked to him \nand you know hanlin tang his colleague \nfrom \nfrom his nirvana days also joined now \nour cto um and we came to the following \nconclusion \nthere's a lot of opportunity to improve \nneural network training by making the \ntraining algorithm more efficient \nand what i mean by algorithm is the \nfollowing because it's worth clarifying \nhere \nso there are a lot of ways that you can \nmake training more efficient one is you \ncan build a faster chip like nvidia just \nreleased the h100 it's a lot faster than \nthe a100 which is a lot faster than the \nv100 that makes training more efficient \nand cheaper \num another thing you can do is write \nbetter compilers you can take the same \nset of operations and run them more \nefficiently you know this is these are \nthings like cu dnn and kernels and you \nknow triton and that sort of thing \nbut i think the interesting observation \nhere is all of this is taking the exact \nsame math the exact same way of training \nevery operation that you're doing and \njust finding ways to run it faster you \ncan you know spin the gpu faster you can \nhave you know faster tensor cores you \ncan you know run pick the right \noperations to run it faster but it's \nstill the same math you'll get exactly \nthe same weights in the network assuming \nyou know non-determinism doesn't kick in \non the gpu or things like that \nand \nthe lottery ticket work is interesting \nbecause it says actually we can change \nthe math we can get you a different \nnetwork than you would have gotten \notherwise but it's just as good and \nhypothetically in our fantasy land where \nwe can accelerate sparsity it would have \nbeen more efficient to get there we can \nchange the algorithm to make it more \nefficient \nand that's what mosaic is built on is \ntrying to look at ways that change the \nmath that fundamentally change the \ntraining algorithm to make things more \nefficient and i'll give you two reasons \nwhy this you know makes a lot of sense \nto me intuitively \none is that you know think about the \nmath behind deep learning \nthere's nothing correct about this it's \nnot like we're doing the right thing and \nmosaic is doing the wrong thing but you \nknow making it work \nwe're using sgd which is a convex \noptimization strategy in a non-convex \nlandscape if you want to get that \nnetwork to train you need like all the \nright hyperparameters just the right way \nif you set the learning rate a little \nbit too high or low bad performance you \nneed batch norm or layer norm or pick \nyour norm you know you \njust like we're living in this tiny tiny \nspace of networks that work well \nit's minuscule it's like you know you \nyou step off of this tiny little island \nof stability and you fall into lava and \nyour network doesn't work very well so \nyou know there's nothing correct about \nwhat we're doing so we shouldn't be \nafraid of changing the math \nthe other reason why i think i think \nthis makes sense is \nlook at this tiny space of networks we \ndon't know how to describe this tiny \nspace theoretically i can't give you a \nproof or a statement or a set of \nassumptions to describe it \nand i think of this kind of the analogy \ni like to use is biology \nso imagine we have the laws of physics \nthink of that as all the neural networks \nthat are out there we can describe them \nall think about biology in you know the \nreal world this is one emergent property \nof physics we are just physics this is \none outcome of the laws of physics if i \ngave you the laws of physics you would \nnever predict the biology here on earth \npartially because it's one very small \npossibility in the range of a huge \nnumber of possibilities \npartially because it's so complex \nthat from first principles it would be \nhard to predict \ni look at the neural networks we train \nin practice kind of metaphorically like \nthis biology it's these are highly \ncomplex systems that have emerged from \nvery simple dynamics like physics but \nit's one specific thing that might have \nemerged and we can imagine all sorts of \npossibilities in theory we have to \ncontend with all these but in practice \nwe only deal with a tiny portion of them \nand when we study biology um \nyou know we \nwe don't go down to the physics \nimmediately we look at motifs and \nsystems and behaviors and mechanisms and \nall these higher level abstractions \nthings that you know we wouldn't \nnecessarily think of from first \nprinciples in physics and so i think of \nthis in the same way as deep learning i \ndon't care what might happen i don't \ncare what you can prove i care about \nwhat is happening and how to describe it \neven if the descriptions aren't perfect \ni don't need a proof i just need good \nempiricism \nand then you can think of what we're \ndoing is almost like pharmaceuticals \nwe're designing some kind of chemical or \nsome kind of intervention that takes \nadvantage of processes we understand to \nget a different behavior out of the \nsystem \nand so we design a lot of these \ninterventions the lottery ticket is one \nof those your body chemistry is no \nlonger functioning the way it was before \nbut ideally you'll get to a similar \nplace or you'll be you know just as \nhealthy as you were before but you know \nideally we can make that outcome happen \nin some desirable way \nand you know there i'll continue this \nmetaphor for one more moment one of the \nbig challenges is not just you know okay \ndesigning one pharmaceutical you need a \nlot of pharmaceuticals to treat \ndifferent conditions to address \ndifferent aspects \nand you know lottery ticket you can \nthink of as one pharmaceutical at mosaic \nwe have you know i think 25 and counting \nright now and that encountering is \nbecause we've got a lot more in the \npipeline that you'll expect shortly um \nand the last thing i'll say here is if i \nhad to do 25 pharmaceuticals you \nwouldn't take them all you wouldn't just \npop all the pills into your mouth and \nsay ah i will be better now \nthese drugs can interact in really \ndangerous ways \nand so a lot of the magic of our work is \ntrying to understand the science of how \ndo these things interact what's going on \nunder the hood in these networks that \ncauses things to interact negatively \nsome of this is systems optimization \nsome of this is \nyou know just two methods seem to over \nregularize or what have you but there's \na science here that we're starting to \nuncover and that helps us build recipes \nso i'll stop there i'm rambling but \nreally mosaic improving training \nalgorithmically i think this is a new \nlayer of the stack \nand i think this composes really nicely \nwith what lots of other folks are doing \nat other layers of the stack hardware \ncompilers all the way up to good you \nknow ux and mlabs so you know that's \nwhere we are \nwow this is absolutely fascinating and \nfirstly uh to preface this i hope that \nthat story of the email ends up in these \nstartup books one day i get that idea \nthat \nyou get an email and that's the start of \nmosaic ml that should be one of those \nbooks but um yeah i'd love to the 25 and \ncounting the composer the interaction \neffects of things like uh \nuh ghost batch normalization stochastic \ndepth and maybe the og mix ran data \naugmentation strategy so \nbefore coming back later on i think i'd \nlove to dive more into the design of \ncomposer and it's kind of api and how it \nintegrates into most of the existing \nworkflows of people working with deep \nlearning but i think it would be great \nto transition right now into some of the \nmethods of composer and you mentioned \nthe interaction effects of these methods \nand the new science is just absolutely \nmind-blowing such a fascinating thing \nbut um so could we kind of come through \nthis list a little bit and maybe could \nwe start off with um \nso i kind of as i went through the early \ndocumentation on method on the \nmethodology and the composer i kind of \nchunked it up into categories of data \naugmentation normalization what i call \nmodel augmentation and then label \naugmentation and optimization so maybe \nlet me start off with model augmentation \nin which i grouped \nthings like \nswa \nrunning average of the model weights \nstochastic depth replaces specific layer \nwith a stochastic version that randomly \ndrops a layer of samples during training \ncan you tell me more about these kind of \nthings like layer freezing uh squeeze \nexcite and how these kind of things come \ntogether \ndefinitely so \nthat i think you've actually done a \nreally good job chunking these off i'm \ngonna have to steal this because we're \nwe're struggling with this right now \nthis is one of the challenges of \nbuilding the science is kind of you know \ni look at something like let's start \nwith stochastic depth because i think \nthat's an interesting one so you can \nthink of stochastic depth as kind of a \nfancy version of dropout what it does is \nin a residual network you can skip a \nlayer and the network still works you \ncan just kind of chop it out but you \nhave those residual connections that go \nthat route around it so \nin a normal feed-forward network if you \ncut out a layer like the network's \ndisconnected and it makes no sense in a \nresidual network you can drop layers and \nso the idea in stochastic depth is you \ncan do this two ways one is that you \njust for your mini batch you drop some \nof the layers and you just skip them on \nevery forward pass the other is that you \ndo this example-wise so \neach example kind of takes a different \njourney through the network and on each \nlayer you only run through some of the \nexamples \nso stochastic depth has a complicated \nstory on the one hand it should \nhypothetically make things more \nefficient because you're not using the \nwhole network on any given pass \nso this should be you know beneficial to \nspeed \nyou might think of it as a model change \nin that way but it's a regularization \ntechnique as well \nso the reason why i'm picking on this \none is it kind of some of these methods \nreally defy categorization or fall into \nmore than one category which is what \nmakes the science so interesting and \nalso so difficult and stochastic depth \nhas an interesting story so there are \ntwo things i'll tell you about this one \nis that you know the paper that came out \nwith it makes a very compelling case \nthat you know this leads to speed up \nbut we actually tried it using the same \nmethods from the paper and we didn't see \nany speed up in fact we saw worse \nperformance \nwhat it turns out happened was the paper \nhad some pretty terrible bass lines \nyou know they trained a c410 network for \nhundreds of epics usually you know 160 \nepics is enough i think they were \ntraining for 500 epics in the context of \nthat 500 epics the regularization really \ndoes help you and you can get better \naccuracy and therefore the appearance of \nfaster training time but you know when \nyou look at normal training \nregimes this doesn't actually help at \nall and in fact we found it to be \nhurtful so this is a good chance for me \nto take a step back and ask what does it \nmean for a method to be good what does \nit mean to have a positive intervention \nand so here's the way we look at it at \nmosaic you know there are a lot of games \nyou can play in the research literature \nto make something look good \none is that you can you know just have a \nbad bass line \nyou can like train your bass line for \ntoo long way past the point where it's \nnot helping your accuracy and then show \noh i made things faster \nby you know showing that it doesn't take \nas many iterations but the baseline \ndidn't either \nyou know \nanother technique is that you can go \nthrough and say well \nhypothetically i reduced the number of \nsteps it took for you to reach a certain \naccuracy \nwhat i'm not going to tell you is each \nstep takes five times as long and i'm \npointing at the sam paper here the \nsharpness aware minimization where this \nis a huge problem each step takes twice \nas long \nand you can train in fewer steps but it \nslows things down and we had to mitigate \nthis \nin the case of stochastic depth there \nare two issues here one is the baselines \nweren't good in the paper um the other \nis that \njust because you can drop examples \ndoesn't mean you can get speed up from \nthat going back to that sparsity example \nwith lottery ticket you know if you drop \nthe examples on each layer you've got \nthis weird shape tensor you have to \nreshape the tensor run it through the \nlayer and then reshape it back and then \nended up slowing things down to the \npoint where the method didn't actually \nhelp from a speed-up perspective \nlandon uh who were our research \nscientists who worked really hard to get \nthis method up and running tried his \ndarndest to find a way to get some speed \nout of that and struggled \nbut it also has a positive \nregularization effect so especially for \nlonger training runs it is still \nbeneficial so these two failure modes \nhere one is you know bad bass lines and \nwe've seen this a lot the other is these \nhypothetical fantasy land speed ups like \nlottery ticket is a hypothetical fantasy \nland speed up at mosaic we care about \ntime and cost those are very unforgiving \nmetrics \num you know well clock time doesn't care \nabout flops and it doesn't care about \nnumber of steps it just cares how long \nit takes to get to a certain accuracy \nand so stochastic depth does help \nbut you know i hope there are two \nteachable moments there for people who \nare thinking about this space \nso if i can unpack just uh a quick thing \nabout the short and long training time \nsay 160 epochs to uh to maybe test a new \nalgorithm compared to maybe \nuh you're training the new gbtx on your \ndata set and you basically want to run \nit for as long as you can right like how \ndo you think about these two resumes of \nshort and long training times \nso the way that i think about this is in \nterms of pareto curves \nthe the entire view of the world at \nmosaic is about pareto curves so i don't \nthere's no right answer to the amount of \ntraining time really it comes down to \nwhat is your budget and what do you care \nabout and maybe you don't have enough \nmoney to train gpt3 forever \nmaybe you know you do \nmaybe you're a big tech company and \nyou've got a bunch of new data \nyou need to get a model deployed for ad \nrecommendation as quickly as possible so \nyou don't have time to train it for \nweeks \neven if you have all the gpus in the \nworld and so \nthe way that we think about this is we \ntrain the model for all different \namounts of time \nfor any given model our baseline is not \none baseline we take our baseline and we \ntrain it for 10 fps and 20 epics and 30 \nepics or we actually double you know \neach time but we say we don't know the \nright amount of time to train so we will \ncreate a pareto curve where we look at \nthe trade-off between \nnumber of seconds it took or dollars it \ntook versus accuracy if you train for \nlonger generally you get higher accuracy \nthat's not true in general you know you \nmay eventually start overfitting or \nsomething like that but by and large \nlet's just take that assumption for the \nmoment so you get this beautiful curve \nand a speedup method is valuable \nif it moves that curve up into the left \nso if it moves that curve you get a \nbetter trade-off at all these points or \nat least at many of these different \nnumber of training steps and you know so \nyou can think about a couple scenarios \nlet me give you a method that takes the \nexact same amount of time to train but \ngets you higher accuracy like you know a \nregularization method like mix up which \ntakes two examples and interpolates \nbetween them and then runs that through \nthe network \nmix-up doesn't really take any \nadditional time but it gives you better \naccuracy \non the one hand that means you know for \nthe same amount of time or the same \nbudget you were putting in you get \nbetter accuracy on the other hand you \ncould just train for less time or fewer \nsteps and get the same accuracy you had \nbefore accuracy can be traded off for \nspeed these two quantities are \ninterchangeable that's really the key \nidea that a pareto curve shows you \nand so things that regularize and \nimprove accuracy are speed ups for the \nmost part some of them like stochastic \ndepth actually you know hurt you on \nshort runs and benefit you on long runs \nso there is you know there's a little \nmore nuance to it there but you know by \nand large we think about this in terms \nof pareto curse and that means that bad \nbaseline is just a point that's way far \nout on the right but it's way past the \npoint of diminishing returns and so you \nknow it's kind of a silly point that \nisn't even it may not even be on the \npareto frontier as far as we're \nconcerned because it may be that you can \ntrain for a lot less time and get \nexactly the same accuracy which means \nit's not on the pareto frontier and so \nwe would just ignore that point as you \nknow non-relevant \nthat's such an interesting way of \nthinking about it and yeah i saw a lot \nof fredo curves as i was looking around \nthe mosaic website and getting caught up \nand so uh so yeah i love that way of \nthinking about how to think about the \ncontribution of these methods but if we \nkind of step a little uh back into model \naugmentation and um you mentioned \nstochastic depth works for resnets but \nif you have a just a sequential network \nwhere you know say node a goes to b goes \nthis c goes to d and you can't drop a \npath because then what are you going to \ndo so it's kind of specific to the \narchitectures and then so another thing \nis um you've implemented a squeeze \nexcite and i love squeeze net \nall that research the squeeze bert when \nthey generalized it from computer vision \nto nlp as well and uh there's also uh \nalibi replace attention with alibi and \nthat those sparse transform all that \nattention stuff obviously yep so \nexciting so how does um \nand before we really get into composer \nand the interface and how to use it how \ndoes that um how do those layers \nintegrate with the the way that you've \ndefined your model code \nso the way that they integrate is we do \nthis thing called model surgery which is \na module that we've written it's part of \nour library which basically allows you \nto do find and replace within a model \ngraph \nand this is really important for these \nkinds of model modifications i want you \nto be able to start with standard code i \nwant you to start with torch vision or \nstart with you know hugging face and \nthen you can use our methods to replace \nthe modules that you want in hugging \nface you can replace the attention \nblocks with alibi attention which you \nknow \ndoesn't you know doesn't cost you \nanything in the speed side and gets you \nmuch better you know short to long \nsequence generalization which means you \ncan train on shorter sequences which is \ngreat for efficiency or squeeze excite \nwhich is kind of this interesting animal \nit gets you much better performance and \nresonance but it it makes the model \nbigger so it can lead to memory issues \nand it can and it slows down inference \nso it's actually a trade-off there in \nterms of squeeze excite we don't include \nsqueeze excited on some of our top \nbenchmarks because the one golden rule \ni've had at mosaic so far is don't make \ninference worse i don't want people to \nhave to say well you made training more \nefficient but i have to trade off \ninference \ni want people to be able to say you know \nmosaic is just strictly better using \ncomposers strictly better these methods \ndon't hurt me they only help me no side \neffects or at least no side effects and \ninference so squeeze excite is great \nit's kind of a basic form of attention \nbetween channels of a convolutional \nnetwork that's the way that i think \nabout this \nand so i you know those kinds of methods \nare tricky because if you modify the \nnetwork you're getting into this tricky \nterritory where you may change the cost \nof inference blur pool another example \nwhich which uses anti-aliasing on down \nsampling same idea thankfully slow down \nfor blur pool is very small \nfor squeeze excite there's an \nappreciable slowdown but it's so helpful \ntraining becomes faster inference that's \na trade-off \none other thing i'm curious about is um \nsay you're trying to maximize how much \nmodel slash gradient you can fit on one \ngpu is that uh say is gradient \ncheckpointing the best way of doing that \nright now \num yeah i think so so we have deep speed \nintegration so we can use deep speed \nzero which does great in offloading um \nso it'll actually you know or activation \noffloading so it'll send activations off \nof the gpu onto the cpu and then pull \nthem back in so that you can basically \ncram an arbitrarily large model into \nyour gpu memory if you'd like to um so \nwe we have integration with deep speed i \nthink zero one and zero two um so you \nknow you can go ahead and use those \ntoday our friends at deep speed have \nbeen really helpful to us again this is \nthe nice thing about being a new layer \nin the stack you can kind of collaborate \nwith everyone i could pretend i'm still \nan academic because you know i like to \nthink we don't really have any \ncompetitors just friends \nso you know deep speed is available and \nyou can do this you know it does cost \nyou something but that's something can \nbe worth it if you're able to cram a \nbigger model on there \nyeah so also on the friends topic \ni really love when i was looking through \nthe composer examples the integration \nwith hugging face and how hugging face \nhas done so much abstraction on the \nmodel code layer that it's like as much \nas auto model for language modeling auto \nmodel for sequence classification is how \neasily you can interface these \npre-trained weights and all the \ncomplexity behind the model definition \ncode is completely abstracted away and \nyou just point at the task i can tell \nyou a little more about the integration \nbetween composer and then hugging faces \nit's just like a tren does the model \nsurgery super interesting and and then \nit just has like a new training layer to \nit yeah so what we're really doing is \nyou can bring in your model pick your \nfavorite model and just bring it in \nbring it into composer and you can use \nit with our methods in our trainer in \nfact there kind of there are two levels \nto this one is that for all of our \nmethods or for most of our methods at \nleast we have what we call the \nfunctional api which is where you can \nuse these methods in any trainer you \nwant in any training loop you want to \ntake these supply torch lightning go \nahead um now there's a reason we built \ncomposer \nwe built composer because it's really \nhard to deal with some of these methods \nand get them to intervene at the right \ntimes you need a lot of if statements in \nyour training loop if you want to do \nthis right and we there wasn't really a \nframework out there that provided the \nfaculties we needed by inventing a new \nlevel of the stack \nyou know we needed \nhooks and tools that nobody had really \nconceptualized before because you know \nnobody had thought about this use case \nbefore \nso we needed to design a trainer for \nthat reason and you know we started off \nin pi torch lighting but it really \ndidn't have the capabilities we needed \nto actually integrate all these methods \nand you know getting back to that \ncomposition of methods question the \nreason why we call it composer \ngetting all the methods to interleave \nproperly and run at the right times if \nyou want to use more than like two \nmethods \nis \nincredibly difficult if you're doing it \nin your own code so composer takes care \nof all that work for you it you know \neach method can have we have events that \nhappen at different points of the \ntraining loop each method you know can \nget triggered by events at different \ntimes it can modify the state of the \ntraining loop we make sure all the \nmethods in or leave in the right order \nif you know there's one operation where \nall the methods go in you know we \nbasically have a stack you know the \nfirst method is the last method out \nbecause you know methods need to clean \nup when they're done \nand those sorts of details are really \nreally hard to replicate in a place like \npytorch lightning um \ni don't say we took a lot of inspiration \nfrom our friends at fastai we really owe \nthem an enormous debt of gratitude not \nonly for the inspiration on a lot of the \nideas that we're using but also on the \ninspiration for the trainer where we use \ntwo-way callbacks where the callbacks \ncan modify the training state so our \ntraining loop is very clean and then you \nwrite these callback functions that can \nyou know \nthat can take root at any time during \nthe training process based on these \nevents and can modify the training state \nthat allows you to inject arbitrary code \ninto your training loop without getting \nthis wildly complicated training loop \nfull of if statements \nso again thank you to our friends at \nfast ai we really owe them in that \nrespect but you can bring your own model \nto composer if you want to \nand you know hugging face has a bunch of \nfantastic models we're not going to redo \nthat work that's you know great work \nthat our friends at hugging face did and \nyou know people already use those models \nwe use those models so \nwe had integration for that you know um \nour friend ross whiteman who produces \nthe tim library of computer vision \nmodels we have integration there as well \nso you can bring in your model from tim \nand use that we're working on \nintegration with several other model \nzoos that are out there because quite \nfrankly we don't want to build these \nmodels from scratch that's not our core \ncompetency that's not what we should be \ndoing anyway and \neven if we did you'll want to use the \nmodel for that's industrial strength \nalready you wouldn't want to use our \ncomposer version so \nyou know we have them there if you want \nto use them we have some basic models we \nbuilt in or bring your own and you know \nour method should be compatible and if \nthey're not it's pretty easy to modify \nthe model surgery to fit the new model \nthat you brought in if you know the \nlayers have different names or what have \nyou \nit that's such a fascinating engineering \ndesign and the two-way callbacks the way \nit lets you interface with these \ndifferent things one other thing i'm \nstill kind of trying to piece together \nwith my own knowledge is how the data \naugmentation flows with it how you have \nsay the data loader and then because \nusually i kind of think of it as like \nimport your data set define how you're \ngoing to be sampling batches from it \ndefine your model code and then the \noptimization logic so how do you kind of \ntie together that optimization logic \nwith the data loading part \nso the you know we use the the standard \npi torch data loader right now um and \nwe're working \none of actually the big things that \nwe've been working on a lot of streaming \ndata loading because at the end of the \nday you know you don't want to have to \nkeep your data locally especially for \nbig data sets and so we want to make \nsure that experience is seamless we're \nusing the web data set project um and \nwe'll be moving to the new pi torch data \nloader that's coming out soon um but \nwith respect to the data augmentations \nthis is a part of the pipeline i'm less \nfamiliar with but my understanding is we \nhave you know it's just another event \nis that you know \non the data loading we can you know run \nan augmentation at that point just \nanother place in the pipeline to \nintervene so it's just another place \nwhere callback can show up and modify \nthe data \ncan you tell me a little bit more about \nhow you think about which operations \nhappen on the cpu and which operations \nhappen on the gpu because \nthis is a messy messy question so \nthis is this is a less of a problem for \nnlp where the data is smaller and you \ndon't really augment the data typically \nthis is actually a pretty big problem \nfor computer vision where we do a lot of \ndata augmentation especially in you know \nthese mod these modern self-supervised \nmodels where we actually do a crazy \namount of data augmentation much more \nthan we would do in a standard you know \nsupervised vision setting \num the problem with data augmentation is \nyou gotta run it somewhere and it takes \ncompute to run these image \ntransformations \nyou have two choices you can either run \nthem on the cpu using you know standard \nlibraries you can run them on the gpu \nusing nvidia dolly \nif you run them on the gpu you're giving \nup some of your gpu throughput and you \nknow in our experiments you gave up 10 \nor 15 of your a100 to do data \naugmentation there shouldn't end up \nbeing worth it for us on the other hand \nif you run it on the cpu you can end up \nbottlenecked on the cpu \nit can take you so long to do the data \naugmentation on the cpu that you're \nactually not using your gpu fully \nyour gpu is way more expensive than your \ncpu so you never want to be in that \nsituation and what we found is that \nthere are a lot of really interesting \npapers out there that use you know these \nkinds of crazy data augmentation methods \num and advertise like you know you can \ntrain in fewer steps yes but you're \nbottlenecked on cpu \neven you know the a100s on aws are very \nclose to cpu bottleneck on rest at 50 on \nimagenet as it stands because the a100s \nare so fast and quite frankly amazon \nselected a pretty crappy cpu to go with \nthem all things considered on our own \ninternal cluster \nyou know which \nyou know stay tuned on whether other \npeople might be able to access that at \nsome point soon we picked cpus \nspecifically for this purpose to make \nsure that they were powerful enough to \nkeep up with the augmentation so the \nproblem here is that you know our best \nnumber resnet 101 at about 3.5 x speed \nup on those awsa 100s that is data \nloader bottlenecked \nthat is actually bottlenecked on cpu \ndata augmentation we could go faster \nwe've broken aws's \nassumptions about the nature of the \ninstance they should build in the \nworkload by speeding things up so much \non the gpu \nthat now the cpu has become the \nbottleneck and you know now we're \nworking with our friends at mit who \nwrote the ffcv library to get that \nintegrated because that's a way of \nbasically doing a lot lower level \noperations and the cpu to speed things \nup um and you know we'll have that \nintegrated i think it's actually already \nintegrated on cfr10 and should be up on \nimagenet soon which should alleviate \nthat bottleneck and you'll see all our \nnumbers on imagenet go up a bunch more \nby virtue of that so it's you really got \nto think whole system on this stuff \nthat's so interesting and i see that as \na lot of these methods i think they have \nto do some kind of offline style \ncomputation like maybe it's an \nexponential moving average of the \nweights and it has that kind of \nbackground computation of doing the \nexponential moving average or the \nstochastic weight averaging similarly i \nthink the um the sam sharpness aware \nminimize i think it also has some kind \nof \noptimization computation it does \nwhat are you oh sorry oh yeah yeah for \nsam you have to basically do the \nbackward propagation step twice \num which you know can get pretty \nexpensive \nso i'm also really curious if you if you \nthink about these like pretty kind of \nambitious meta-learning loops where you \nhave sort of like a teacher student you \nhave like a teacher inference so maybe \nthings like uh \nyou know meta pseudo or even maybe kind \nof coming more into the things that are \nalready in composer we have og mix where \naugmix has what augments is for people \nwho don't know is you take your original \nimage you form three augmented versions \nof it by randomly sampling three \nconfigurations from rand augment then \nyou do a pixel-wise averaging of that to \nget the final augmented image and the \nthe next extension they did was augmax \nwhere they add an adversarial controller \ninto the weighting of those \npixel wise averages so you're starting \nto add more kind of optimization in \nthese little things how do you see that \nkind of idea of adding optimization not \njust in the gradients of the classifier \nbut also in say \nthose kind of \nmeta layers of these kind of algorithms \nplaying into the composer design as well \ni think it starts to necessitate a \ndifferent \ncomputational architecture at that point \nbecause the augmentation stuff has \ngotten so expensive \nso we don't use augmeix we have it \nimplemented augmix we have found no \nscenario where we can get around that \ncpu bottleneck for aquavix you have to \ndo nine image augmentations \nyour cpu bottlenecked across the board \nrandogman we found works decently if you \nhave you know if you have a good enough \ncpu to gpu ratio that can either mean \nyou slow things down on the gpu you use \nmethods that you know make things slower \nbut reduce the number of steps or \nyou know again it's a balancing act we \ngot to make sure that you know our gpu \nand cpu throughput are balanced or you \njust use a bigger model which you know \ntakes longer to train or you have a \nbetter cpu like we have in our own \ninternal cluster that you know that \nallows you to use rand augment \nproductively another interesting \nscenario where this starts to help \nif you look at the aws t4s not the you \nknow not the 100s but the t4s they're \npretty wimpy gpus they're built for \ninference so they're about a third as \nfast as a v100 but aws way over \nprovisioned the cpus \nso actually on a t4 you can use augmix \nand randognet just fine \nso in fact in scenarios where you want \nto do a ton of augmentation and you \ndon't really care about how long the job \ntakes just cost the t4s may actually be \na much better bet than the v100s or \na100s \nbut you know augmix we haven't really \nfound any other scenarios where it makes \nsense randogman it makes sense in \ncertain scenarios especially for long \ntraining runs \nbut by and large we you know matthew \nlevitt who implemented these methods for \nus you know i think was pretty \nfrustrated at the end of the day that \nyou know they didn't make sense simply \nbecause they were slowing down each step \nand they were taking you know the \nbottleneck was no longer on our most \nexpensive component on our gpu it was on \nthe cpu so you know great methods very \nuseful but when i look at some of these \nself-supervised learning papers and i \nsee the amount of augmentation they're \ndoing i kind of take a step back and go \ni wonder if they're fully utilizing \ntheir gpu \num but in terms of how to do this going \nforward or you start to get into these \nadversarial scenarios you need an \naccelerator just to do your augmentation \nlike and i think nvidia i haven't looked \ntoo much of the h100 set up if i recall \ncorrectly they have kind of this \ncoprocessor h100 that does networking \ndata loading and preparation to send it \nto the real a100s \nor the real h100s so you know i think \nnvidia's got in the memo that having \nthese co-processors is necessary you \nneed a gpu just to prepare your workload \nfor your gpu then you get into questions \nof you know is that the best use of your \nresources or should you just drop it all \ntogether um you know that's a complex \nsystems optimization problem but \nthis really changes the architecture and \ni will say that makes a lot of sense for \nvision i think it makes a lot less sense \nfor nlp where data is just smaller in \nterms of number of bytes and we don't do \ndata augmentation so this does beg the \nquestion do you need two different \nhardware setups for vision and for nlp \nwhich complicates the hell out of \neverything \nyeah and i think maybe in nlp too you um \nyou don't really like repeat through \nyour training data as much like if \nyou're going through uh yeah like web \ntext you probably will never even make \nit through the whole data set with most \nof the training so it's like why \naugmented to begin with and maybe just \nquickly i wanted to see what you think \nabout maybe like offline data \naugmentation where you kind of \nstart storing so it's not stochastic \nanymore it's deterministic and you store \nthe \naugmented data set there's a paper \ncalled the deep bootstrap framework \nwhere they sample from a ddpm generative \nmodel and they uh they store the data \nset it's cfar five million it's \navailable on github so you can you know \nyou have this offline \nuh in that case it's sampled from a \ngenerative model but you can imagine \napplying rand augment and then storing \nit do you think that would be \na useful direction going forward \ni think the data sets end up getting too \nbig you know for imagenet you're \nrepeating through the data set let's say \n90 times conservatively that used to be \nthe standard back in 2015. in the past \ncouple years i've seen this creep upward \nto 180 and then to 300 then to 600 times \nthrough the data set um \nimagenet is already uncompressed \nprobably about you know 400 gigabytes \ni'm guessing \nnow you have to do that 100 times over \nand you're talking you know what is that \n40 terabytes of data \num so then you get into questions of is \nit worth the storage costs and is it \nworth the network bandwidth costs to \nstream this data you know over your \ncluster that can become its own issue \nespecially if you're streaming the data \nfrom you know one cloud region to \nanother from one part of the cloud to \nanother usually for data sets like \nimagenet you can cache them locally or \nat least they automatically get cached \nin memory if you have about a terabyte \nof memory \nyou you obviously can't do that for a \ndata set of this size so i think this \ncan work for cfar \nonce you get beyond cfar i don't think \nit makes a ton of sense and really at \nthe end of the day you start thinking \nyou know in terms of storage costs it's \ncheaper to have a co-processor that will \ndo augmentation or to just buy some \nreally big cpus than it is to pay for \nthat extra storage \nso one more idea i want to run by you \nbefore coming back to the efficient \nmachine learning is what if maybe we \nstored the vector representations of \nimagenet so we had something like some \nkind of api offering that produces \nvectors and then we saw those vectors \nand then we start \nhaving complex networks from vector \nrepresentations or maybe it could be \nlike the vq vae where it's still like a \nmatrix but it's like you know how they \nmap it into the discrete codes but \nthere's some kind of compressed \nrepresentation and maybe we could have \nstorage and things like a vector \ndatabase \nthat would store those things no i think \nthis is a this is a great idea and in \nsome sense that's almost where we are as \na community you can think of simclear \nand moco or you know whatever the latest \ngreatest method is you can tell them a \nyear out of date on this topic um \nyou know that is what we're getting \nessentially is you know if we were to \njust train a network on top of those \nvector representations you know that's \nwhat you do when you fine tune sim clear \nmoco assuming you're just fine-tuning \nthe head and not the actual network if \nyou fine-tune the network obviously it's \nmore complicated um one of the biggest \nchallenges there is again augmentation \nwise yeah you've got to actually perform \nall this augmentation at some point but \ni guess to your point if we have a \nsmaller representation of the image then \nwe can do all that augmentation offline \nand i've also always wondered i'm sure \nsomeone's written a paper about this can \nyou find you know ways of basically \ndoing an augmentation to a vector that \nthat is equivalent to an augmentation \nyou know \nof the image itself and you know so that \nyou don't even have to store the image \nso yeah i think this is a yet another \nplace where these vector style \nrepresentations are incredibly valuable \nso you know i'm all ears on that the \nbiggest challenge is still you've got to \nget that simclear moco style network \nand what i'm finding and chatting with a \nlot of folks in the community is \nthey want to train their own network on \ntheir data because they have a huge \namount of data \nself-supervised learning unlocks this \ngigantic amount of data that most \ncompanies and just many individuals have \nfloating around and everybody nobody \nwants to use gpt they all want their own \ngpt nobody wants to use a pre-trained \nsim clear moco they all want their own \nand you know people often ask me \nif you know we only do fuchsia or zero \nshot learning what's the point of \ntraining you know what's the point of \nmosaic \nif people are using you know these \nvector representations and that's it \num my response is you know so far \ni have seen no evidence that people are \ntraining less um the h100 would not be \ncoming out if people were training less \nso as far as i'm concerned as long as \nthere's training there's mosaic and \npeople seem hungry to have their own \nbert model pre-trained on their own task \nor you know fine-tuned quote-unquote on \ntheir own data but they have more data \nthan the burt was pre-trained on to \nbegin with anyway so \nrumors of the death of training have \nbeen greatly exaggerated i'll say that \nmuch \nyeah i think that's one of the most \nfascinating topics in our current stage \nof deep learning is this can we just use \nprompting where we just have these maybe \ndiscrete prompts or predefined templates \nto get large language models to do \nwhatever we want train on infinite data \nand but even even then you would have \nlike a continuous prompt tuning usually \nwhere you put the prompt into a latent \nspace and you still want to put \ngradients through it and those papers \nseem to be the ones that are more \nsuccessful anyways and so kind of and \nthen quickly before coming back to \nprompting but and then the idea of yeah \nlike one can one model produce in vector \nsearch when we talk about embedding apis \nit's like can one embedding api produce \nembeddings for every kind of application \nwhether it's e-commerce biomedical \nliterature mining you know news reviews \nand it's like there's a paper called \ndon't stop pre-training which shows that \nyou know that's not really the case \nfine-tuning on the domain it's going to \nbe useful so coming back to prompting \nand this idea of still putting gradients \nthrough continuous things that you put \nin the middle of the networks uh what do \nyou think about and there's papers like \nvnl adapter where they only tune four \npercent of clip they don't fine tune the \nwhole architecture what do you think \nabout that kind of masking in the \narchitectures to you know put these \nlittle layers \nthat you update \ni think this is a great idea i've seen \nthis you know i wrote this paper on \ntraining only batch norm \nwhere i started with the randomly \ninitialized network um and thought it \nwas cool that you could still get good \nperformance just by training the batch \nnorm parameters which you know for \nreference don't even they're not really \nreal parameters they're kind of scaling \nfactors and bias factors for random \nfeatures in the network i thought it was \ncool that you can train even okay with \nthis let alone train somewhat decently i \nwon't claim you can train well that's a \nbridge too far for that paper \nbut you know in writing that paper i \ndiscovered this is an old idea most \npeople aren't starting with randomly \ninitialized networks but there's this \ngreat paper called k for the price of \none that shows okay you just you know \ncreate new sets of batch storm \nparameters for each downstream task and \nkeep all the other weights fixed so i \nthink this is a pretty profound idea \nand it's a nice spin on the idea that \nwe've always had of transfer learning \nwhere you just replace the head of the \nnetwork and keep everything else it \nlooks like the right answer is actually \nyou know having trainable features \nscattered throughout the network is the \nway to go \nso you know i think this is a deep \nprofound idea the biggest challenge \nbeing as soon as you scatter these \nparameters it's not as efficient as just \ntraining the head because you have to \nyou know forward prop and back prop \nthrough all these other layers in the \nnetwork there's a cost to doing this \nbut you know given how much better it \nworks i'm sold you know i think this is \na fantastic idea it's i won't give \ncredit to any one person for this idea \nbecause you know i'm sure this idea goes \nback into the 80s and before if we \nreally were to dig and find evidence of \nit just as all good ideas in deep \nlearning do but it's an idea that seems \nto keep coming back and there's a reason \nit keeps coming back \nyeah that paper training bash norman \nonly batch norm that just was like how \ncan that work how it like similar to \nthings like uh layer sharing i can't \nbelieve layer sharing works either these \nthings that kind of defy sort of like my \ncore like principles of how these kind \nof things work and so yeah mentioning \nthat um you still have to kind of train \nthis whole thing and so is that kind of \nstill was bottlenecking bringing all the \nall the way of the spar sub network \nmasking back to life kind of \nnot really i think this is i'm guessing \nif you were to sit down with a couple \nfolks from industry and i have no \ninsider knowledge on this \ni'd guess that you'd hear that if folks \nhave kind of a multitask setting they're \nusing this especially i'm guessing on \nmobile devices things like this are in \nuse \nit's a great way to \nyou know to efficiently store many \ndifferent networks \nin a small amount of storage so \ni would i would hypothesize to you that \nthis may be running on your phone or \nyour computer right now and you just \ndon't know it \nand i don't know it right now so it's a \ngood enough idea i'm sure it's in \npractical use \ndo you like the vowels of google \nsomewhere who's doing it \ndo you like these like mixture of \nexperts models do those kind of things \nexcite you \nthey do excite me i think they excite me \nfor a couple reasons one is that you \nknow it's a way to train bigger models \nwithout increasing the cost of inference \nyou're kind of you know you get more \nparameters for free in some sense it's \nnot quite free you have to manage all \nthese experts and you have to use the \nright ones at the right times but \nassuming you know ideal costs and not \nthinking too much about how do you load \nthe right experts at the right times and \nall that good stuff \nit's basically keeping the cost of \ninference fixed as you increase the \nparameter count that's that's a huge \nbrilliant idea \nand the other piece is you know it's \nsparsity i like sparsity and you know \nthat's what i'm known for sparsity shows \nup in all different forms of neural \nnetworks and as i mentioned weight \nsparsity which i've studied probably you \nknow in i would say it's the most \ninteresting part scientifically but one \nof the least useful parts of sparsity \nmixture of experts is really interesting \nto me scientifically but more \nimportantly it's incredibly useful \npractically so i'm a believer i think \nthe biggest challenge with mixture of \nexperts is there's some threshold you \ncross where you need a sufficiently \nlarge network before mixture of expert \nstarts to make sense \num \nand the question we should ask ourselves \nis is that threshold going to increase \nover time or decrease over time will we \nget better at training non-mixture of \nexpert models to the point where you \nknow \nreally you know mixture of experts \naren't useful until 100 billion \nparameters aren't useful until a \ntrillion parameters um or actually a \nmixture of experts going to scale down \nto the point where they start being \nuseful all the way down i think this is \na big question for us as a field \ni'll point to one trend as context for \nthis i look at vision transformers this \nis something that you know i still train \nresnets i'm still a believer in \nconvolutional networks vision \ntransformers are popular and i think \nthey're really exciting \num there have been a bunch of papers in \nthe past few months showing that \nactually if we just give all the \nresonance the same tricks we gave \ndivision transformers \nwe can you know resonance work to larger \nand larger scales than we would expect \notherwise and do better and better um \nthe threshold where it makes sense to \nswitch from a resnet to a vision \ntransformer is getting higher \num and you know if that trend continues \ni kind of wonder \nwill vision transformers always be niche \nto some extent because we'll keep \ngetting better and better at training \nour cnns \ni'm not entirely sure but \nyou know it's always a question to watch \nwhere do those thresholds go do they go \nup in which case cnns may be the future \ndo they go down which case vision \ntransformers may take over same thing \nfor mixture of experts does that \nthreshold go down and do we you know do \nwe have a small mixture of experts that \nare more useful than the equivalent \nsmall models or do we get better and \nbetter about training those you know \nquote unquote small models as in smaller \nthan 10 billion parameters to the point \nwhere a mixture of experts you know only \nmakes sense at the absolute largest \nscales \nyou know open question but always worth \nkeeping those trends in mind \nyeah that's fascinating the idea of \nbringing the mixture of experts down i \nyeah i mean it kind of it kind of seems \nlike the like the spar sub network's \nidea it's very similar to it right in \nkind of the purest form of it \nand um so i kind of did want to ask you \na little more about attention and \nconvolution just quickly um i've really \nbeen liking attention for say uh like \nfeature like latent space fusion and \nparticularly with like multi-modal image \ntext models where you you kind of \ncompress it into bottleneck all the way \nsuch that you have a vector \nrepresentation of the image you have a \nvector representation for the text and \nobviously we like to search through the \nvectors with our dot product but then \nwhen you want to fuse that you can have \nthat attention \ndo you like that kind of attention layer \nfor that thing and \nwhen you think about generalizing it do \nyou think convolutions \nmaybe like an mlp layer to fuse them or \nyou know you could just concatenate them \nalong the i think with some computer \nvision architectures you just kind of \nconcatenate a tensor of features along \nthe channel axis and then just \nconvolve away with it right \nso i think they you know i'll give you \nthe boring answer which is what i like \nhas nothing to do with it um at the end \nof the day it's what works \nand you know i'm a believer in the \nscience and we should do the science and \nunderstand what works best for \napplication we should look at the \ntrade-offs in performance um you know i \ndon't have enough experience with \nmultimodal models to tell you what the \nright answer is i will say cnns are \nstill pretty darn good for you know \nbasic computer vision tasks \nbut you know when it comes time to \ncombine features from multiple different \nrepresentations or multiple different \nyou know kinds of features from \ndifferent kinds of backbone networks it \nwould surprise me if convolutions work \nwell in that setting because really they \nare a great fit for dealing with image \nactivation maps and not so much for \ndealing with you know arbitrary tensors \nalthough there were a lot of cnn based \nnlp models in the pre-transformer days \nso i would expect that you know \nattention or a feed-forward layer would \nwork better as to which one and in what \ncontext um you know i leave that up to \nyou to go and do the research and find \nout for yourself and report back to me \nand let me know i know there's been a \nlot of push back and forth of like mixer \nmodels \nand you know just kind of non-attention \nbut attention looking not attention \ntransformer style models versus \nattentive models at the end of the day \nwe can do the science and find out for \nourselves and you know i like whatever \nworks best you do the work let me know \nthat's a great answer transitioning into \nwhat i wanted to ask you next is um you \nhave such a clear thinking about asking \nscientific questions i really admire \nthat i think the way that you're able to \npose these questions identify the \ninterventions confounders that are in \nthese experiments is is you know very \nprofound skill and i want to ask you how \nyour experience has been with your \nscience and then starting a startup how \nhas the science and the startup creation \nplayed together \nthe startup will not succeed as a \nbusiness unless we do good science \nand that is somewhat by design um you \nknow i \ni don't want we have a big research team \nat mosaic it's about a third of the \ncompany right now and it will you know \nit may not always be that large because \nwe got to build a business but it will \nstill be a significant research team and \nit's going to grow the company will grow \nfaster than the research team you know \nthe research team may be growing by 50 \nor more by the end of the year also you \nknow mosaicml.com jobs come you know \ncome apply for a job we're growing but \ni don't want us to be a google brain or \na fair where this is a fun \nthis is a fun diversion for an executive \nwho's already made all their money and \njust wants to do something interesting \nyou know no pointing fingers but \ni want to make sure that we're doing \nscience that is essential to the \nbusiness \nto get these speed-up methods to work \nwell we have to intervene into training \nvery carefully and we have to understand \nwhat we're doing and why the why makes \nus more efficient in terms of developing \nthese speed-up methods the why is good \nfor the business \nwe are certainly in this wonderful \nscenario right now mosaic where the \nscience and the business are aligned we \ncan't have one without the other \nand \nso we you know we have to we have to do \ngreat science we have to be rigorous we \nhave to turn over every leaf we have to \nbe even more rigorous i would argue than \nyou have to be in academia because we're \nnot just trying to sneak some graphs \nthrough the publication process \nand you know sneak some claims through \nthis has to actually work \nand it's you know anybody who's written \na paper knows going from getting a graph \nin a paper published to getting it to \nactually work is really hard and really \nscary and often we say we'll leave that \nto the practitioners well here we are \nwe're the practitioners and also the \nscientists and we have to make this \nhappen \nso \nyou know i think the science we're doing \nat mosaic is as good if not better than \nthe kind of science that would be done \nin academia and it's impacting the real \nworld so that makes it all the more \ndifficult i will also say when it comes \nto scientific communication as i \nmentioned before \nyou know we need to basically put \nprescription labels on each of these \nmethods and describe everything about \nthem it looks like you've seen our \nmethod cards which our researchers \nworked really hard on and i spent most \nof the past month on i'm just revising \nand cleaning up all of them \nto tell you how does this work what does \nit do what are the trade-offs what are \nthe warnings associated with this what \nside effects might it have \nbecause you need to know you won't trust \nme to say like i did something crazy to \nyour model and i won't tell you what it \nis we have to earn your trust \nand so we have to communicate all this \ninformation a publication is not the \nmost efficient way to do so but \nscientific communication is still \nparamount for our research team so as \nfar as i'm concerned science and \nbusiness completely aligned and i'm \nreally grateful for that kind of \nopportunity because you know i think it \ngives the researchers so much more of a \nsense of meaning than you'd have if you \nwere just writing papers all day \nyeah it's so great that's so interesting \nto hear and um yeah the the startup and \nthe science the way it plays is so \ninteresting and i didn't want to quickly \ncome back to um the yeah i love the \nmention of the interaction effect \nbetween these different methods and you \nmentioned that at the beginning of the \npodcast it was just like mind blown for \nme thinking about that do you see that \nas the way that you're going to \nempirically collect these data these the \nexperiments to see uh how does \nstochastic depth mix with augments and \nhow does ghost batch normalization \ninteract with \nsome kind of other strong regularization \nsuch that your regularization is going \nto be you know ruining the training is \nthis kind of similar to hyper parameter \ntuning where you might use things like \nmaybe osha where you have uh different \nresource allocation these kind of \nstrategies to \ntest all these configurations how do you \nplan on exploring the combinatorics of \nthat space it's sort of like hyper \nperimeter tuning except that you know \ni'm not sure the space has the nice \nsmooth shapes that you want for hyper \nparameter tuning where you know as you \nincrease the learning rate accuracy gets \nbetter and then worse for example \ni don't think the space necessarily has \nthose dynamics because adding a method \nor not adding a method is a discrete \ntransformation in a lot of cases you \ncan't just kind of slowly phase in a \nmethod in a way that would make \nhyperparameter tuning work much better \nand you know these methods again have \nthese weird crazy interactions that are \nyou know not smooth in the way that \nhyperparameter tuning would expect \nso really i think the way that we're \ngoing to do this is a couple of ways \none is we're getting intuitions for the \nway that these methods might interact \nfor how you you know i mentioned before \nbalancing the training process if i've \ngot something that you know requires \nextra augmentation on the cpu \ni want something that will actually slow \ndown each step on the gpu \nideally that is traded off for training \nfor fewer steps something again like sam \nlike sharpness aware minimization \nbut sam if it can reduce the number of \nsteps and not slow things down too much \nthat can make room for a better \naugmentation technique and you hit this \nvirtuous cycle so it's it's a systems \noptimization question in that respect \nthere are also things like the \nregularization budget where you know we \nhave a lot of different regularization \nmethods we could use we should use the \nones that basically impose the least \noverhead for the best improvement in \naccuracy we developed this method \nin-house called call out it's a lot like \ncutout which is where you take an image \nand just cover up a square patch of it \nexcept instead of covering up a square \npatch we eliminate rows and columns from \nthe image so that you can actually lower \nthe resolution \nit's like cut out but faster because now \nyou actually can take advantage of those \nmissing pixels \nso these are the sorts of tricks that \nyou know come in handy \nand you know these are the ways of \nthinking about it but there's a science \nhere and by improving that science we'll \nget better about coming up with these \nrecipes not only ourselves but ideally \nautomatically for customers \num you know and then on top of that \nonce we have a good recipe for a \nparticular vertical like say resnet50 on \nimagenet our hypothesis is this should \nwork reasonably well for other related \nmodels like densenet or for other image \nclassification tasks so there's a way of \nkind of \ntaking advantage of all of this \nbut it's right now it's kind of it is \nmore alchemy than science and we're \nwe're trying to develop a science in a \ncompletely new area for the record i \nthink this is a great academic problem \nand i would encourage folks in the \nacademic world this is one of several \nbig new exciting academic problems i \nwish people were working on right now \nthat i've discovered only through kind \nof being pressed into the real world and \nhaving to deal with some of these \nconstraints that i can usually avoid as \nan academic \nand um \nso it's super interesting i mean the \nidea of lowering the resolution all \nthese efficiency gains in general maybe \ncan enable say video processing where \nwe've been bottlenecked by having to \nhave these absolutely massive data sets \nto try to have high resolution high \nframes per second video but \nreally what i wanted to ask you about \nnext is um have you been like how have \nyou \ngrasped your intuition with the deep \ndouble descent phenomenon and things \nlike rocking where they show that you \nthey leave it running i think they even \nsay that their experiment they had just \nleft it running accidentally and what \nhappened is it was like overfitted then \nlike two days later suddenly it like has \nlearned generalizable representation \nsomehow has how do you uh wrap your \nunderstanding around \ndouble descent and these kind of things \ndouble descent \nbends my mind a little bit \nyou know \ni there's a paper that i'm working on \nwith you know a student in in my old \nresearch group where we're looking at \nthe relationship between sparsity and \ndouble descent to try to understand you \nknow maybe \nyou know is the double descent \nphenomenon really just you know having a \nlot of parameters means you find a small \nsubset of parameters that actually work \nwell it just gives you more options but \nyou're still learning a low dimensional \nrepresentation \nso this is something we're talking about \nand thinking about to some extent the \ndouble descent phenomenon doesn't really \nmatter in practice and i'll go out on a \nlimb and say that for a few reasons \nfirst of all we're often not training \nthese models to the point where they can \nmemorize the data often the models \ncannot memorize the data gpt3 can't \nmemorize the training set it's nowhere \nnear big enough resonant 50 can't \nmemorize imagenet it's not big enough \nso you know on that hand we're \nyou know we're not really in that regime \nnecessarily double descend is maybe an \nexaggeration of a regime the other part \nis that in order to get those two \ndescents in order to get like that sharp \npeak in between you have to work for it \nyou have to like the deep double descent \npaper had to use random labels to get \nthat to show up that wasn't something \nthat just shows up naturally it looks \nalmost like a smooth curve with kind of \nmaybe a little bend in it \nbut \nyou wouldn't really tell this phenomenon \nis happening so it does i think beg the \nquestion coming back to where i started \nat the beginning of this conversation to \nwhat extent is this a natural phenomenon \nand to what extent is this an artificial \nphenomenon that you know we can \nwe can suss out to use to understand \nwhat happens naturally but you know \nthere's always that question of when you \nsee an artificial phenomenon how much \ndoes it have to do with practice and how \nmuch does it have to do with the natural \nworld um you know i i think deep double \ndescent does have a lot to do with the \nnatural world perhaps i don't understand \nwhy yet and we don't understand why yet \nbut it's always worth asking that \nquestion how well does our model or how \nwell does our \nsetting of inquiry actually relate to \nyou know the settings we care about and \nin deep double descent i \ni think we've oversold a little bit just \nhow natural these settings are they're \nnot that natural \nat the moment \nthat's an eye-opening take away from me \nbecause yeah i've just come to accept \ndeep double descent as something to be \naware of but yeah i actually haven't \nreally encountered it in the experiments \ni've been running it \nit hasn't really been something that has \ncome up with me but so the next topic \nthat i'm super excited to get into is i \nsee mosaic ml as almost being like \nelectric cars in the way that this is \ngoing to help with climate science and \nsay the damage that is done by training \nthings like gpd3 and if if we just \ncontinue this arms race of you know just \nrun as much as you can to you know build \nyour ai businesses compared to these \nkind of efficiency algorithms which are \nreducing that kind of \nuh footprint on this can you tell us \nabout your mission on helping with \nclimate science with this with these \nalgorithms \nyeah so a big part of at least my \npersonal motivation here is the energy \nusage aspect \num you know just as these models cost a \nlot to train and they take a lot of time \nto train you know time is money and time \nis co2 \nnow we haven't looked into co2 emissions \nthat much at mosaic simply because i \nrecognize it's easy to do a bad job of \nco2 emissions calculations these data \ncenters are often using renewable energy \nor near energy sources that are less co2 \nintensive these data centers may use \ndifferent mixes at different times of \nthe day \nso the amount of nuance you need to be \nable to tell people yes doing using \nthese methods reduced your co2 emissions \nis actually \nreally difficult \nand i you know this is the scientist in \nme i don't want to do it unless i can do \nit right so if there's someone out there \nwho has expertise in this topic or is \nexcited about looking to work on this i \nwant to hire someone to basically \nspearhead this but i know i'm not the \nexpert and i'm not going to read a \ncouple papers and become the expert \nsomeone has to have studied this for a \nlong time to really know exactly what to \ndo here so you know i don't want to do \nthis until we can do it right but by \nthat same token just if you look at \nsheer energy usage you know time is \nmoney and time is energy and we know \nthat at least from an energy usage \nperspective if you can train more \nefficiently you can reduce the energy \nusage and i look at the h-100s i you \nknow i had a rather uh cynical tweet \nyesterday that i will try to explain \nwhich is you know the h-100s are pretty \nremarkable \nthey're 6x faster at least if you look \nat the sxm highest bin part one that we \nprobably won't see for another year but \num you know 2x of that is from floating \npoint eight so kind of you know a little \nbit of cheating in some sense \nas you start working your way down that \n2.5 x or 3x faster that you get \nis by doubling the power \nyou know you're going from 350 or 400 \nwatts to 700 watts on the sxm parts on \nthe highest end \num \nmoore's law is dead \num you know dinard scaling is dead \nthe idea that every two years you get a \nnew part that is the same cost as it was \nbefore but is twice as fast for the same \nenergy that's dead \num we got a new part for twice the \nenergy that is about three times as fast \nand you know jury's out on the price but \ni expect it'll be pretty expensive at \nfirst \nso you know plot that trend out \nand you know maybe the next part we get \nwill be 2x the power 2x the price and 2x \nof speed i don't know how much further \nwe can keep pushing this without \nthrowing more power at the problem \nand so we've just hit our limits the \nmodels are getting bigger what is it the \nstat is like 4x per year larger um in \nthe past couple years um hardware has \ngotten let's see we've got two years um \nwe doubled our power output um \nand we you know 2.5 x or 3x star compute \nso 50 improvement over \ntwo years um call it 25 per year uh 25 \nper year in terms of hardware efficiency \nper watt um and probably efficiency per \ndollar \num \n4x \nor 400 \nincrease in model sizes and model you \nknow model fluffs \nyou can do the math and see there's a \npretty huge gap there \nand we just need more compute and more \npower to keep up with these models it's \nnot like the good old days of the 90s or \nthe 2000s where you know what was the \nsaying you know um you know intel \nintel makes and then microsoft takes you \nintel doubles the amount of compute for \na dollar microsoft makes software twice \nas resource consuming \nwe're we're not in those days anymore \nwe're just consuming resources way \nfaster than we can keep up with it and \nhardware is not going to do it \nall the fancy architectures in the world \nthat folks are coming up with are very \nexciting and video is still the fastest \nmost efficient ship in town despite all \nthe interesting hardware architectures \ncoming out from startups and you can see \nwhat's happening to nvidia so \nwhat's going to close that gap either \nit's just going to be out of reach \nincredibly expensive and incredibly bad \nfor the world or we have to change the \nalgorithm \nthat's where i think mosaic comes in i \nthink this is \nthis is the future of how we're going to \nbe able to take that 400 increase per \nyear and make sure that it's at the same \ncost \nand i think that was one of the uh the \ncomments on your tweet was uh if you \nhave it people are just going to run \ntwice as many uh hyper parameter \nconfigurations they might \nat the end of the day people will spend \ntheir budgets \num but budgets are not going to increase \n400 per year so we can talk about energy \nwe can talk about you know time but \nlet's focus on cost at the end of the \nday somebody's going to say \nyou need to spend how much money to \ntrain this model you spent four times \nless last year what are you talking \nabout \num and if budgets don't scale that's the \nend of the day if people want to use \ntheir budgets to do more you know if \npeople get their budgets 4x and want to \ndo hyperparameter tuning you know to \nsome extent more power to them i can't \nstop them and you know \nmosaic will do better as a business if \nthey decide to do that \nbut \nyou know i like to hope at least you \nknow \nat some point some executive's gonna say \nwhat the hell are you doing \nwhy are you spending all of our money \ntraining this one model and at that \npoint you know we're going to have to do \nsomething different \nsuper cool jonathan thank you so much \nfor uh for your time and for coming on \nthe podcast and discussing all these \njust amazing things i think the work \nthat you're doing mosaic ml everyone out \nthere should really try the composer \nit's such an easy thing to add on to \nyour existing workflows and testing out \nthese methods is so incredible so thank \nyou jonathan so much for telling the \nstory \nthank you so much for having me i'll \ngive two quick shout outs actually three \nquick shout outs at the very end one is \ni'm just the messenger this is the work \nof a huge team of researchers engineers \num you know everybody at mosaic so it's \nreally nice that i get to show up and \nbrag about 30 people's worth of work \num you know i really am the manager here \ni have not written a line of code since \ni got to mosaic so credit where credit \nis due to the incredible team um and \ni'll say you know if you want to join \nthat incredible team we are hiring like \ncrazy so mosaicuml.com jobs and the last \nthing i'll say is you know check out \ncomposer give it a star um you know i \npromised everyone that you know i try to \nget us to a thousand stars by the end of \nmarch and the end of march is coming up \nso you know a star would be great um \ncomposer.dev you can take a look thank \nyou so much for having me \nthank you and uh the composer to give it \na star i'll be linked in the description \nof the video first thing so go click \nthat and do that right now \nthank you \n[Music] \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Podcast #12 \u2022 Jonathan Frankle, Research Scientist in Deep Learning", "path": "", "link":
