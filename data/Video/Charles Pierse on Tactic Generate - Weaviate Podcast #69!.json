{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the 69th episode of the Weaviate Podcast featuring Charles Pierse from Tactic! \nhey everyone I am beyond excited to be \nwelcoming Charles Pierce back to the \nwevia podcast Charles was our second we \nVA podcast guest and now he's back for \nthe 69th episode of the wevia podcast so \na ton has changed in the space of large \nlanguage models and Vector databases as \nwell as what Charles has been working on \nso when we first talked Charles working \non kinius and now Charles is building \nthis incredible tool tactic generates I \nwanted to quickly give a tour of what \nthis is I think this will also really \nhelp ground the conversation topics in \nthe podcast to get a little sense of uh \nwhat this looks like so to get to get \nstarted I've loaded in three papers that \nI'm currently looking at EXA ranker \nperspectives on large language models \nfor relevance judgments llms can \naccurately predict Searcher preferences \nand so all I did is I just you know \ngrabbed the archive URL from these \npapers click sources add import URL and \nthen drop the paper in so what you can \ndo is you can ask questions across \nmultiple documents so if I ask the \nquestion what are some of the challenges \nof using large language models to \nannotate search relevance I can get an \nanswer based on each of these different \npapers so so each of these different \npapers might have found a different kind \nof conclusion about these questions if \nyou have a question like you know say \nyou loaded in different retrieval \naugmented training papers and you say \nyou know how effective is this versus \njust fine-tuning without retrieval and \nthen you have this question answered \nacross multiple documents I think it's \nsuch an interesting tool the user \ninterface makes it so easy to kind of \nask these really complex questions as \nwell as to export your summaries and \nshare it across your team so I think \nthis is going to have a huge impact on \nresearch and how we use these kind of \nretrieval augments generation tools so \nhopefully that gave you a sense of what \ntactic generate is about with that said \nI love this podcast it's such a fun \nconversation let's dive into it hey \neveryone thank you so much for watching \nthe weba podcast I'm super excited to \nwelcome Charles Pierce back to the weba \npodcast Charles Pierce was our second we \nV8 podcast episode and now we're back \nwith the 69th episode of the Eva podcast \nnearly a year and a half later Charles \nwelcome back to the podcast thanks very \nmuch Connor it is great to be back \num very happy to be back on the podcast \nand to catch up on what's changed \num it feels it's only been what a year \njust a bit over a year and a half but I \nthink in the land of ML and AI That's \nprobably like 10 years so I think \nthere's a lot to catch up on \nyeah the the scope of everything I I \nre-watched our episode preparing for \nthis and we were talking about you know \ngraph embeddings rotating and and that \nwas kind of the most exciting thing of \nthe time and now we have these llms and \nyeah everything is totally different um \nso maybe to kick things off last time we \nwere framing our podcast around kinius \nand now you're building uh tactic and \ngenerate can you tell me about what \nyou're working on yeah so I'm working at \ntactic working on kind of the on all \nthings machine learning there and uh \ntactic has \num you know we kind of have two uh core \nkind of products that we're working on \nand the first are our core product of \ntactic which we've been building uh for \nthe last two years or so is really \nfocused on kind of sales and marketing \nteams \nand it's really to help them uh do uh \nkind of enrich their accounts in their \ncrms and to do research on all of those \naccounts and that's really really high \nhigh scale so you know in the tens of \nthousands \num and if like you know discover a new \nnet net new accounts and yeah that kind \nof stuff but it's very much focused for \nlike kind of sales marketing rev-ups \npeople \num and whereas lately the last couple of \nmonths we've been building this new \nproduct \nand it's called tactic generate and \ntactic generate is really aimed towards \na problem that we've definitely heard a \nlot from our existing customers which \nwas \nyou guys are really good right now at \ngoing out into the internet and like \nretrieving relevant Snippets and \ninsights for us to help us enrich our \naccounts but we also have all of these \ndocuments internally and we have all \nthese really really big PDFs or \nyou know Excel sheets or PowerPoints \nwhatever \nand they wanted to do analysis on those \nand or do some really kind of in-depth \nresearch on those and we heard that \nproblem a lot and we decided to build a \nproduct for that and that's what tactic \ngenerators it's built for kind of \nresearchers analysts journalists and in \ngeneral it's it's really for knowledge \nworkers people that are doing kind of \nFairly in-depth um knowledge work and \nwhat it isn't is it's not a chat tool \nyou know it's not exp you know we're not \ntrying to do \num a chat gbt or anything like that \nthere's some really great products out \nthere that do that and that's not that's \nnot kind of the Wheelhouse that we want \nto operate in for this you know where \nit's a slightly different Target \nuh it's super interesting yeah I'd love \nto stay because um you know firstly I \nreally like the interface of you know \nyou have the kind of like left panel of \nupload the documents and you put up you \nknow let's say five documents and then \nyou have the middle interface for the \nyou know the questions that you've \nanswered and yeah I love this um I kind \nof maybe diving in a bit quickly but \nthis uh like llama index one of the most \ninteresting kind of like llm framework \nthings has been this kind of like uh \ncomparison across documents prompt where \nyou kind of uh like one of the examples \nwas um let's say the five PDFs are like \nuh laws and I think in the tactic \ngenerate video it's like uh where was \nthis established and it's like this one \n1930 this one 1940 this one 1960 so that \nkind of like uh question answering \nacross the documents can you tell me \nmore about how you think about that just \nlike yeah like question answering across \nmultiple documents yeah like comparing \nmultiple documents with LMS yeah \num I think this is really \nthis is really why we we decided to \nbuild this is because I think a lot of \npeople out there when they you know they \ncan upload a document or two maybe to to \nsome of the existing uh chat \napplications out there but you know when \nyou get in the scale of you know tens to \nhundreds of documents \nit gets kind of hard and a lot of the \nservices out there actually block you \nfrom doing this anyway because you know \nunderstandably that's a lot of context \nand if \nif they don't if they're not using a \nlet's say vectors like vector search in \nthe back end they're trying to fit this \nin context and it becomes impossible \nso the way we wanted to think about this \nwas if you want to do cross document \ncomparison that should be super easy to \ndo and we know that there's a lot of \nresearchers out there that have kind of \ndocuments that might be similar the \nexample we often think of is annual \nreports so a public company that's doing \nannual reports every year you might have \nyou might be working for you know a \nfinancial institution and have 100 100 \nannual reports that you have to ask the \nsame set of questions about extracted \nthe same side of information across \nand you need to get all that data and \nyou need to do it fast well in the \nmanual research world this could \nprobably be you know our best two days \nwork of worst a week or two is worth \num but it's it's actually it's \nrelatively easy task but the the format \nthat you extract that data in is \nactually quite important you know people \nlike to have this in a in a tabular in a \ntabular kind of format or an easy way to \ndo comparisons so this was the initial \nkind of starting ground for tactic \ngenerate when we thought about it we \nwere like we want to enable this one \ntask first to begin with so \nwe built it so that you can upload 100 \nannual reports and then ask a set of \nquestions of those annual reports and \nthen bring all of that data back \num and then have a nice table uh display \nbut then furthering from that you know \nwe also want to go with go forward with \nthe next step of what analysts and \nresearchers do which is probe that data \nand you know \nwe're really trying to mimic \num and learn from the workflows of \nresearchers and the the users we're \ntrying to build this for so we kind of \nkept asking ourselves okay we've \nextracted this data and and then what \nyou know what do we do next with it so \nthat's that's what we're really focusing \non as well which is actually \nonce we get this data extracted having \nsome actions that we can take so if I \ngive you if you give me a table of \num answers about 100 annual reports I \nshould be able to reprompt this or like \nre-question ask a question now overall \nof this extracted data \num that \num you know is a more complex piece of \nanalysis like given given this data \nabove which of these companies is best \npositioned \num in you know to utilize AI in a in a \npositive way or given giving the above \nresults which of these uh which of these \ncompanies is sensitive to interest rate \nchanges you know these types of like \nmore complex questions \num so that's kind of like what our \nthinking around it was \nyeah well that's so interesting I mean \nthe um yeah just the idea of turning you \nknow you have questions is the columns \nand like a CSV and the the value is the \nanswer to the question for each of the \ndocuments and then applying some kind of \nyou know processing on top of that yeah \nthat's also amazing I think kind of like \nyou know in our theme of catching up \nafter a year and a half this kind of \nlike um like llm calls kind of like this \nis like chaining this like the core idea \nof laying chain where like it does these \nintermediate inferences and then from \nthere you can do something else with the \noutput of that llm call it kind of \nsounds like that to me yeah yeah that's \nthat's that's a big way kind of in which \nwe think of it and \nanother really tricky part of this that \nwhere you know we still kind of very \nmuch consider ourselves in the beta beta \nphase you know we're getting a lot of \nfeedback because we had a great response \nto it when we released but what we \nreally are trying to do as well is \ntry to automate as much of this process \nin the background as well so you know \nwhether it's query routing or deciding \nwhen to chain or when not to chain based \non the data we have or you know as lamb \nindexes we've learned from when to when \nto create queries and combine those back \nit's all of these kind of complex things \nare really important when building an \napplication like this \num and yeah it's quite exciting and you \nknow it's pretty much changing changing \nevery week but um yeah \nyeah this is music to my ears I think \nthis is so interesting it kind of \nrelates to like we have this kind of \nleviate land idea called generative \nfeedback loops where you take the data \nTransformer with an LM and then save it \nfor further processing and I guess like \nmy question so yeah this whole like sub \nquestion query engine Islam index calls \nit or this kind of you know question \ndecomposition transform the data to use \nit in some way later it's also \ninteresting I mean I yeah I've been \nreally trying to reason through this \nbecause I know that some people think \nthat you know the kind of like Auto gbt \nstyle where you just kind of let the llm \nrecursively decide to split the task \ninto more tasks and it goes on and on \nand people say you know okay that makes \nfor a great demo but it's quite hard to \nreally tame that thing for something \npractical I think what you found where \nyou you know break it into kind of these \ntasks of first asking a question over \nall the documents and then trying to you \nknow reason about how you combine those \nanswers from each of the documents is \nyeah it sounds really I love this kind \nof thinking and yeah I'm just curious \nlike \nso I guess my question so you found this \none this kind of chain of like and we \nvia also we have like a generate uh API \nwhere we would call this like single \nresult prompting where you apply it to \neach of the search results and then you \nhave a group drizzle \nso it's like you found this chain that's \nreally useful so yeah that I think my \nquestion is like what is your sentiment \non these chains the discovery of these \nkind of chains and yeah I guess how you \nthink about applying new chains and this \none particularly where you transform uh \ndocuments into question answering pairs \nnow you have a structured View and now \nyou have some uh comparison prompt \nyeah yeah that's actually \nhow we think about chains has been \nsomething that's really been on my mind \nbecause \num I kind of agree with what you said \nabout you know these when you hear about \nthings like Auto GPT a lot of the time \nis they're really they really are great \nfor demos \num but for anyone that's tried to ship \nthem in production and everyone knows \nit's a it's a very different situation \num and as well as that it can also \nbecome prohibitively expensive if you're \ndepending on you know third-party \num and I think this is why \nyou know I've seen I've seen topics on \nTwitter where people say will Vector you \nknow are vectors \nVector is Vector search needed in this \nlike constantly evolving world can we \neffectively just put everything into uh \none big giant context and I'm in the \nvector search \num and I have a good reason for it and \nit's because you know llms \num can be used kind of like a hammer for \neverything but it can be a very \nexpensive Hammer if you use it for \neverything when it doesn't need \num and you know if uh you know open AI \nrelease a new model tomorrow which has \n100 100K uh context length well then \nsomeone's just going to start wanting to \nput in 100 documents that have a million \ncontext lines and then if they increase \nit it's just gonna it's gonna be this \ncut and mouse game so I think you know \nit's always important to actually keep \nefficiency in mind when we're designing \nthese things so when we think about \nChains It's like they're useful \num and doing the kind of chaining \nchaining sub-actions is a useful task to \ndo but preferably we would like to \ncontrol as much of that ourselves and a \nlot of the time it usually ends up with \nus building some micro chains and it's \nnot maybe not using a chain a framework \nthat will do it for us and just kind of \ndoing it ourselves out of the box \num a lot of the time because it can be \nyou it just gives you that bit of \nfinesse and control that when you have \nkind of a kind of a vertically \nintegrated app you need some sort of uh \nsome sort of like business kind of \nknowledge applied to that \num so we find that helps and yeah we've \njust found that you know if we can if we \ncan smartly combine Vector search and \nnot just Vector search but also the \nembeddings you get back it's really \nimportant remember the embeddings you \nthat we store in weeviate are very rich \nin themselves and you know if if for \npeople out there you know what were once \nconsidered like you know big uh normal \nmachine learning tasks like clustering \nthey might be I feel like they're really \narchaic now but obviously not but you \nknow if you know how to do a few tricks \nwith embeddings and understanding what \nthe you know those latent spaces and \ncinematic representations mean you can \ndo a lot of these tasks that are \nexpensive llm calls just using those you \nknow the embeddings are very powerful \nobjects and they're much cheaper to play \nwith than llm calls a lot of the time so \nwe've had really good good \num good luck and we'd like to we like to \nuse it that way so I think to summarize \nwhat I'm trying to say is chaining \nchaining queries together is great but \nhaving a bit of uh control over them \nlike manual control is important in \nproduction situations \num and also exploring what Avenues are \nuh cheaper Avenues are there in terms of \ninference and overall cost is really \nimportant and for the equivalent results \nI think a lot of the time \nyeah I really want to come back to well \nthere are two things I want to come back \nto with the yeah like how you discover \nthese micro chains you mentioned and I \nhave something interesting for that as \nwell as then the cheaper inference thing \ntoo but \num yeah maybe the like quickly touching \non these points I think the the \nclustering the topic modeling thing it's \nstill so fascinating to me I love that \nkind of topic I see startups I see you \nknow Martin grutendorf who he still had \non who we had on the podcast he's still \nhitting it with the topic modeling \nadding the llama2 to it and he's doing \nawesome stuff and then we have like \ngnomec Ai and arise AI that are and I \nthink weights and biases has like a \nvisualize your latent space part of \ntheir product too but yeah there's I \nbecause I imagine this um you know \ncoming back to tactic General like I I \ngive you a hundred annual reports or you \nknow I I give you a hundred slack \nmessage or like a customer support thing \nor something I think about a lot and \nthen you cluster it and then you tell me \nthe topics I think there's still so much \nuse in that and and then one other kind \nof little thing I wanted to touch on \nmaybe we'll come back to it later was um \nyeah yeah like this Vector search thing \nI'm actually my perspective on weeviate \nthese days is I'm I'm kind of thinking \nof you know my scope of weavate is \nexpanding for how I personally see it \nlike um you know we weave has an \naggregate API as well so with this \ngenerative feedback loop thing what you \ncould do is um you know you Trend let's \nsay um the the one of the questions \nyou're asking each of your documents is \nuh what was the annual revenue for this \nyear and then you store that as an in \nproperty and we V8 like feed it back to \nev8 and then you can have you know \nwhat's the average revenue so you can do \njust those symbolic aggregations and so \nI think especially as retrieval \naugmented generation is evolving like \nwe VA I think it's would be it's cool \nfor people to know that you can use it \njust for like Json retrieval like you \ncan just apply filters and just get your \ndata out of it you can also do SQL style \nand then you can also do Vector search \nand I think the scope of that is going \nto continue to evolve as well you know I \nthink I could write like a whole blog \npost and diving into that topic but yeah \nso I really want to come back to so \nthese these micro chains and I've heard \nthis I so there's this there's this \nthing I've been exploring from omark a \ntop called dspy or dspi I think where \nit's about uh you you compile these \nintermediate steps for some kind of \nchain and so you so as so how do we \ndiscover These Chains to do do tests \nthat's kind of the question I think is \ndo do you give the llms like some kind \nof action space like here's the kind of \nthings you can do and then it searches \nthrough it somehow \nyeah I think for us it was it's been \nkind of easier to discover these chains \nbecause you know we're very much you \nthis product is very much driven by what \nwe think our users kind of want so we're \nwe're trying to be very ux-led with the \ndesign of this product and I think \nthat's quite important with AI uh \nproduct design these days so because of \nthat we're very user-led we're listening \nto what uh people that want to use it or \npeople that are using it so we're kind \nof trying to we're trying to look at \ntheir workflows and say what are the \ncommonly occurring kind of like modules \nor like facets of their workflows and \nthen those are kind of our chains you \nknow saying oh whether a summary what \ndoing a summary or doing like a \ncomparison or doing like a kit like kind \nof a splitting out key points or doing \nlike a topic extraction doing an \nextraction of people or looking for key \nfigures these are these are kind of like \nwhat we would probably consider chains \nso it's kind of easier for us to reason \naround them because they are very much \nconnected to like requests and you know \nus just aggregating in requests we get \nfrom users so I think that's kind of \nthat that's what makes it easier I \nsuppose for us to specify out these \nmicro chains I was talking about because \nthey're very much related to things we \nknow people people want and then you \njust kind of have rooting you just \nfigure out how to root those to the \nright place when you get a question in \num now in figuring out how to do that \nmore and more intelligently is difficult \num but that's that's kind of the way we \nthink about it \nso I think another thing that makes it \nso interesting is like uh one podcast we \nhad was with Yana wellender who's \nbuilding craftful and so she's like uh \nshe's kind of like what you're doing \nshe's marrying these two skills where \nshe's a product manager and she's like \nhas a really good sense of you know llms \nand prompting and all this kind of stuff \nand so she does she combines that to \ncome up with the micro chains for \nproduct manager tests like analyzing \nuser feedback prioritizing a road map \nlike that kind of thinking and I think \nit sounds like what you're doing with \nthat but with crms and sales and that \nkind of stuff yeah it sounds like a \nreally nice marriage of these things \nyeah and uh yeah sorry I have one other \nidea that I forgot maybe we'll come so \ncome coming back to this I I do also \nkind of want to talk about \num so you know there used to be this \nthinking around like to have like a moat \nwith your ml product you would have to \nlike open AI is just gonna if all you \nhave is prompts they're just gonna \ndestroy you eventually yeah \nhave these conversations \nwhat's your sentiment I I personally \nbelieve no because yeah I think this I \nthink there's so much to structure like \nwhere you see the structure and I don't \nI don't know but you know obviously the \nend-to-end Deep learning people think \notherwise yeah yeah so you know \nthis is why we're not building a chat \napp you know it's uh it's been done it's \nbeen done really well \num it's not where we saw our mode and \nit's also we we know where our skill \nsets are and it it was in uh building \nbuilding products that solve kind of \ndifficult uh uh problems for researchers \nand an analysts and extracting key \ninsights and then the a huge part of \nthat is ux and I think ux's role \nin um AI product development has I'm not \ngoing to say underplayed but it's not \nlike the the part that gets the most \nmedia attention or the most hype around \nit but I think it's like incredibly \nimportant and if if there's to be in the \nworld of like you know open Ai and all \nof these great providers of large \nlanguage models if there's if their \nmodels or their modes you know the the \nmodes for other companies out there \nshould be things around \num ux and then like just how they \ncombine all of these little tasks \ntogether in a very user-friendly way \num and you know we when before we even \nwrote a single line of code for this new \nproduct we really just thought about \nwhat's you know what's the user \nexperience we wanted to to deliver and \nI'm not and that's not even to say we're \nnowhere near where we want to be but \nwe're really thinking about it and \ntrying to trying to get there is \num kind of thoughtfully and fast as as \npossible \num but what was a really big uh thing \nfor us a big kind of aha moment was \nwe had a realization about what the what \nthis generate would be kind of from a ux \npoint of view and I think for any data \nscientists out there are people who are \nkind of have worked in data science or \nanalysts it could make sense from a data \npoint of view but I was a big consumer \nof Jupiter notebooks Once Upon a Time \njust as a data scientist so I was I've \ndone a lot of work in Jupiter notebooks \nover the years and people that work with \ndata they understand implicitly how much \nof a change those added to the world of \nlike data analysis and how big a deal \nthat was \nso we kind of asked ourselves we said do \nwhy does something like this exist for \nlike kind of language knowledge \nextraction where the data the primary \ndata is actually a natural language and \nwhat we kind of thought about is no it \ndoesn't \num so \nthat's actually a big inspiration for \nour ux is we are kind of we view \nourselves as like an AI notebook for \nknowledge workers that's kind of like \nour house thinking around it and what \ndoes that mean well it means we think of \nwe think of your application your in \nterms of cells so things are cells just \nlike the way they are in notebooks and \nyou can add a question cell or you can \nadd a question table cell which is like \nthe comparison stuff you've seen you can \neven add in text notes which can be \nmarked down or whatever \nbut Beyond just the UI those being like \nvisual cells there's something else \nthat's bigger there and that's \nreproducibility \nso when we talk about reproducibility \nwhat we mean is let's say you've figured \nout a really nice way to analyze annual \nreports you have this workflow kind of \nlike an application almost you have an \nAI workflow a way of asking questions \num and conducting analysis on \num a bunch of annual reports well that's \ngreat annual reports come out annually \nand quarterly reports come out quarterly \nso this is actually a repeated task \nsomething that you'll want to do \num on some sort of time frame and this \nis where the notebook ID I think really \nshines because using that we can kind of \nyou know use the same structure of your \nnotebook and reapply those questions to \neither new data or updated data and this \nis kind of the reproducibility aspect \nthat we've been thinking about so you \nknow I can share my notebook schema with \nyou \num and then you can copy that onto your \nown type of data as long as you know \nhoping that it's from the same sort of \ndistribution \num we're not there just yet but we have \nkind of the Scaffolding in place to to \nbuild out this notebook structure Rick \nwe have like the notebook visuals and uh \nwe're getting towards in the kind of \nmedium term towards having this \nshareability and reproducibility in \nthere and I think that's a game changer \nbecause \nit not only allows people to do things \nlike you know a common analysis over \num an annual report but you know it \ncould allow people to create weekly \ndigests from an AI you know based off of \nuh whether it's reports coming in for an \nexecutive from uh people that you know \nthat are reporting into them or one \nother integration we added in at the \nvery start was GitHub you know what if \nI'm a CTO and I want to know what my \nteam has been working on every three \ndays well I could conduct have this \nreport that runs through scans my GitHub \naccount runs it through this report and \ndelivers it to your email it's that kind \nof reproducibility that we've been \nthinking about \nI'm building these kind of like AI \nnotebooks or AI applications for \num kind of a really large variety of end \nusers and when we think about trying \nthis all back to where we started that \nisn't really an llm problem that's a ux \nkind of design problem as well and \nthere's a lot of other kind of \nengineering \num problems that you need to solve in \norder to be able to deliver that so I \nthink that's where we think our our \nmotives and that's what kind of \ndifferentiates us \nyou know firstly that was fantastic that \nwas mind-blowing I I know I'm gonna make \nhim know I'm cutting that out and \nputting just the last five minutes on \nTwitter \nand I'm not even just saying this \nbecause we're friends when I saw the \ntactic generate I had this similar kind \nof thought that like you have um you \nknow tamed The Prompt into a UI so to \nsay this is like a document comparison \nthing that makes sense and yeah I think \num like in addition to Chad gbt I think \nprobably a lot of our listeners know \nwhat uh perplexity AI is and uh \nperplexity AI they have like this kind \nof like cite your sources a GUI with the \nuh chai GBC so you know it's a little \nmore like search engine llm fused \ntogether and you know we've yet we've \nbuilt an open source verba which shows \nyou you know like yeah the the the \num the front end and the ux is so much \nopportunity and I mean just the last \nthing you said really was is really \nexciting to me because um like I think \nabout like um you know with me say I \nhave this hypothesis about out like \ncurrently my hypothesis is like oh I \nthink gorilla llms are going to do such \nand such a thing and so I might imagine \nlike you know I one thing that I do like \none of my I've got this from Tim scarf \nhe said this on the machine learning \nStreet Talk is um like what's your \ninformation diet and so part of my \ninformation diet is I comb through the \nthe tweets I've liked for the last week \nand I just kind of you know \nsee what happened basically and so I can \nimagine yeah dragging and dropping all \nof that into \num into tactic and then saying like a \nquestion of like would any of this \nchange my hypothesis about the current \nthing because like you know when Falcon \n180b you know arbitrary thing that came \nout this week is like maybe that changes \nmy hypothesis about \nfine-tuning llms or yeah something like \nthat yeah yeah that's what you kind of \nsaid there is exactly how we're thinking \nwhich is we know there are people out \nthere that have kind of like their own \npersonal workflows for how they like and \na lot of it could be in your process \ndata and then the questions you ask of \nthat and what we're trying to do is just \nfigure out a way to like weave all of \nthat in together and give you just an \napplication to do that so we're like a \nwe're like an intelligent data pipe for \nworkflows \num yeah so I have a question for you \nthis is something I've been thinking \nabout like with the verba project is um \nis like does fine-tuning have any role \nlike um you know so verba is a quick \nbackground is like you know it's like \narbitrary vlogmens a generation app and \nwe're dog fooding our own weevia you \nknow you have to issues for the we V8 \ndocumentation that's how you do it and \nso I think about like you know what \nwhether you would um you know thumbs up \nthumbs down the responses and then rohf \nand whether that still has a role in \nthese kind of things or if we're just \nkind of like zero shot LMS \ngo for it yeah like I think the thumbs \nup and thumbs down definitely has is \nimportant but like the \nI like when I think about this the \nproblem with it right is \neven even though like you know \nreinforcement learning with human \nfeedback has gotten it's we know how \ngood it is you still need like a \ncritical mass of data to get going \nand I think it's hard to say to people \nwell you need to get like ten thousand \nten thousand responses like thumbs up \nand thumbs down to this before you get \ngoing I think anyone that's developed an \napplication where you're looking for \nlike Thumbs Up In terms then responses \nno it's generally it's hard to get \nclicks and stuff like that even if \nyou've got a really busy product a lot \nof people just don't leave that kind of \nfeedback \num but when it comes to fine-tuning in \ngeneral and then versus something like \nrag \nthe way I've been thinking about it I \nsaw a really great tweet that like stuck \nhas like stuck in my head ever since \nI've seen it and I think it was saying \nthat you know fine-tuning is for style \nand retrieve rag is for facts and like I \nstick I think that's like that makes \ntotal sense to me and I even seen the \nwork you guys did last week with Gorilla \nthat I think that like still adheres to \nall of that because you know the style \nthere is actually like a structural \nstyle of you know emulating graphql so \nstyle is important in that instance \nbut if if Fox \num and retrieval and just bringing back \nthe right data is important I think \nretrieval suits more to that need you're \ngoing to get a lot more out of retrieval \nthan fine dining because most people's \ndata isn't too far out of distribution \nlike your data has to be fairly \nsignificantly out of the original data \ndistribution I think in order for \nfine-tuning to make a ton of sense \num and I know there's a lot of there's a \nlot of people that do fine-tune these \nmodels on very particular data and it is \nof course it has its place but I think \nfor a lot of you know Enterprise users \nand stuff like that the value add \nfrom uh from fine tuning mightn't be \nexactly what they think it will be \nespecially if it's like trying to imbue \nlike if there's a certain if there's \nlike facts and information figures you \nwant to be returned I would just use rag \nright you know that's that's it just \nseems so much cheaper so much faster to \niterate on and to control than \num fine-tuning \nyeah I think my I have a few a few \nthings on this like um so our last \npodcast with farshad fireboxy and the \nGen AI specialist at AWS he presented \num instead of style he phrased out his \nskill versus knowledge and and he used a \nlawyer example where it's like you know \nme I could have the world's greatest \nlike I could have the perfect uh laws \nthat I need to help get you out of jail \nand you're still going to jail if it's \nme who that has to reason about the laws \nthat help you out so it's like but I I \ndo agree that like um you know I think \nwith um I think as we think about like \nthe future of this too I think probably \nthere's going to be some like let's say \ngbt5 like what do we think that's going \nto look like we we're seeing these long \ncontext llms like we had ophira press on \nthe podcast to explain how Alibi \nattention works and like there's even \nlike a week later there's like yarn \nscaling it like moves that fast and and \nso so it's like um I think that you'll \nbe be able to put so much context into \nit that it'll really be that that will \nreally take over and just zero shot with \ngreat context but so I kind of but um so \nstaying and yeah the style for so I \nguess I'll make you one more point on \nthe gorilla thing with that thing is \nlike I think there are some for me \ngorilla is about \num like you don't need a massive \nlanguage model to write graphql yeah \nit's like and and there's a lot of \nlittle tasks like that \nthat's kind of how I see the gorilla \nthing yeah and I it's probably because \nyou know graphql the great thing about \nit is it's a structured language so I \nimagine when when finding tuning lamb on \nthat it like it probably really picks up \nand uh picks up and the the structure of \nit fairly fast because it's it's a it's \na programming language so it's actually \nnice and has a limited syntax which is \ngood \nyeah I'm so excited about like uh \nDestiny coder there's like a new code \nFoundation model that's it's oh man it's \nso interesting how the how you fine tune \nbut you need like the foundation model \ncheckpoint to fine-tune from and it's \nlike well can someone give me a smaller \nFoundation model \nyeah and it's all really crazy I mean \num yeah and like I also think the text \nto SQL models would probably be smaller \nmodels like you know this yeah but so I \nkind of want to talk a little more about \nfine tuning and so you know you I think \nwe both agree that to have your llm you \nknow reason across your documents \nprovide these summaries and like \naggregate the results from the single \nquestions in the tactic sense that you \nprobably don't need to fine tune it to \nreason about your specific thing it \nprobably is going to just be such a \ncapable reasoning engine that with some \nretrieve context and with the current \nthing it will get you there but there's \nstill this idea of fine-tuning the \nsearch models maybe yeah like maybe you \nfine-tune ranking models or embedding \nmodels how do you currently think about \nthat yeah Yeah well yeah I see what's \ngreat about search models and embedding \nmodels and rear anchors is they are like \nyou know orders of magnitude easier to \nto fine tune and they're just like \nlighter cheaper models in general \num and there is it's they're just so \nmuch smaller and I actually think \nretrieval models are such a fantastic \nexample of how bigger isn't always \nbetter for in terms of you know in like \nlarge language models you know retrieve \nlike retrieval models are just so much \nbetter than uh like very very large \nlanguage models for you know picking at \nthe top K candidates and I know llms \ncan't really even do search but you know \njust what if you look at the the the top \nretrieval models um kind of in \nbenchmarks out there at the moment \nyou know open AIS uh Ada two is like \nkind of in the middle of the results and \nyou have these open source models that \nare like \nyou know probably under two gigabytes in \nsize \num like vastly outperforming them like I \nmean I think that's a really good sign \nshowing that if you've got like specific \nvery task specific things you know \nthat's where there are so still there \nstill exists exist cases where llms are \nnot the king it might \ngive it a year and let's I'll probably \nyou know change my view on that but \nright now that's still the truth \num so when it comes to retrieval models \nthey're they're great they're really \neasy to to to fine tune so let's say you \nknow we decide oh we've got a really \ngood use case for for law or for Health \nCare well then you know to to train \ntactic for health or tactic for law \nthat's a that's a lot easier for us to \ndo and then to pass that into uh uh llm \nto kind of pick out the passing and the \ninformation it needs so picking up \nimproving the retrieval is a much easier \ntask and you know \nfor the right for the right if the if \nthe down if the other domain is you know \nsignificantly out of domain you know you \ncan only fine-tune llama \nor something like that on on that domain \nthere's always an option to do that and \nyou know it there's there's probably \nlike a strange correlation between the \nindustries that would require you to \nself-host the model anyway and how to \ndistribution their data is I'm talking \nabout like healthcare and like people \nstuff a lot of the time these might be \nIndustries where sharing you know the \ndata is so sensitive it can't be sent \nover in llm so you might as well just \nfine-tune your model on it anyway \nbecause it's it's going to be \nself-hosted or I think that's what I \nthink there is going to be anyway when \nI'm seeing what's happened with llama \nthe last couple of months is it's going \nto be a lot of you're going to see a lot \nof people looking for expertise or \ncompanies out there that can help them \nfine-tune and deploy their own special \nmodels in-house because they're just \nthere's just there's a bunch of \nIndustries out there and they're just \nnever gonna allow certain data to move \nover the net over their apis no matter \nhow secure \num \nuh the the API provider is or the \nservice provider is they're just they \ncan't you know I live in Europe you know \nthere's just there's no ways can allow \nsome of that data move over move over \nthe web that easy \nyeah well I I want to parse out this um \nyou know easy to up easy to train \nretrieval models I think firstly I'm \ntalking to the wrong guy because I \nremember in our other podcast you had \ntrained you use the pie torch big graph \nthing and I mean that is like pretty \nhard but I I think I think the um for me \nthis is actually kind of the phase shift \nin training and betting models I mean \nfirst the first thing that happened with \nllms is it was looking like you could \nuse the LMS to generate synthetic \nqueries and that was like the oh now we \ncan you now we have positive pairs you \nknow and that was kind of exciting it \nbut I think and especially for the long \ntail queries like you know queries that \nare sorry documents that are frequently \nqueried on you can kind of even out the \ndistribution more this way by having \nqueries for those documents but I think \neven that for me you know contrastive \nlearning I don't think that was going to \nI don't I don't know I you know like we \nsee products for fine-tuning in the \nmarket but I think this end to end you \ntrain the llm the gradients from the LM \ngo back to the encoder as well that \nmakes training embeddings so easy yeah \nyeah \nso yeah I think that's really \ninteresting \num I I the whole world of fine-tuning to \nme I think is in flux \num I don't know if you saw this week but \nyou know there's a new kind of \nthere's a new continuation of \nreinforcement learning for human \nfeedback called the acronym so difficult \nto remember but reinforcement learning \nfor AI feedback \num so it's you know the exact same as \nhuman feedback but just replacing the \nhuman in the loop with a kind of an AI \nagent that's prompted to understand that \ntask somewhat \nand to me \nmaybe it's not my kind of unpopular \nopinion on oral HF is that I don't think \nit I think it's actually a \nit \nit's it's going to be something that \nshouldn't exist in five years because it \nactually highlights issues with our \ncurrent training regiments for fine \ntuning and for training for training \nmodels in that the the latent data that \nthe original model is learning from \nisn't good enough or the architecture of \nthe model isn't good enough \nto train a model you know to be able to \ndo these chat tasks in a in a really \ngood way you know that so you actually \nneed to do this fine-tuning step whereas \nmy expectation would be that you know we \nget enough compute and enough we improve \nthe architecture enough that in a couple \nof years we're kind of just back to \nwhere we were with the original \nregressive Auto regressive models which \nis you're just passing in the data it's \nand you're not giving it any you don't \neven necessarily need to do this \nreinforcement learning task it's just it \nit has enough capacity to learn I'm in a \nchat context here or here I'm in a \ninstruction context or here I'm in an \nextra context that to me seems more pure \nthan this layer at the end of doing fine \ntuning \num \nnot not that I think you know \nreinforcement learning hasn't been \namazing it's been what's given us kind \nof the last year's worth of improvements \nbut it feels like an in-between step \nhmm \nyeah I don't I don't really have a great \nthought on this my I just I guess for me \nit's like um uh the difference is always \nI guess I don't really understand the \ndifference that well honestly like with \nreinforcement learning with human \nfeedback it's like you like the answer \nso you could also just kind of language \nmodel that answer it's not necessarily \nthat it has to be plus one minus one \noptimized with proximal policy \noptimization and uh you know have a \nreward model and all that kind of stuff \nI'm not sure I understand you know I I \nknow that there is like if people out \nthere listening are curious like Nathan \nLambert has written a lot of great stuff \nabout this at hug and face and I just I \nhaven't read it yet I I don't know but \num this um this kind of like llms versus \nsynthetic data is so interesting I mean \nkind of coming back to tactic I mean I \ncan imagine like um and maybe not the \ncurrent generation of albums with the \nmultimodal LMS that like use a UI or \nwell I mean yeah maybe coming out of the \nUI and just let's say just with apis \nright like we could have LMS like a \nmulti-agent kind of system \nthis kind of yeah what do you think \nabout this kind of direction of like I \nthink there is a paper it's like uh it's \nlike a large language models content and \nbehavior language models something like \nthis but but yeah it's like about \num the llms like you know they simulate \nusing because you mentioned like a gbt4 \neval where the LM is prompted like with \nthe instruction response pair did the \nresponse follow the instruction and \npeople are that's that's actually like I \nthink the most common way people \nevaluate the question answering systems \nyeah yeah so like I I do think we're \nprobably going to see a world where it's \njust gonna be \nlike it's going to be models calling \ncalling models \num I mean what you guys have done with \nGorilla I think you could you could if \nyou think about it you could probably \njust extend that outwards right which is \num \nyour your model gorilla is for kind of \nGRA has knowledge of certain graphql \nschemas well I I have my private model \nwhich I also have trained on my private \ngraphql scheme or maybe it's the rest \nmaybe it's SQL \nthose models can now talk to each other \nin like natural language they actually \ndon't need to know each other's schemas \nso my one can request data from yours \nvia like natural language queries and \nvice versa and then they can convert \nthose in the background to the accurate \nschemers return it so I think there's \nthis I've vaguely thought about this \nwhere you have this world now where you \ncan have models effectively um \ntalking to each other that are \nfine-tuned on very specific schemas but \nthey have no knowledge that the other \none has like a specific schema behind it \nbecause the model would probably still \ncome back you know in a natural language \nresponse but like it's it's actually \ncreating a structured database whether \nit's SQL or graphql or whatever it is so \nthat yeah that's kind of one once what I \nsaw you did last week I was like oh yeah \nyou could potentially have this world of \njust like agents talking to each other \nvery just through natural language but \njust distilling it down \nyeah I'm really gonna like dream into \nthe future with this one but I I've also \nbeen thinking a lot about crms and \nparticularly like um you know like my \ndream with the gorilla project is kind \nof the Integrations angle where you \nwould say uh you know uh build a llama \nindex query engine from my notion \nworkspace titled biochemistry store the \ndata in weeviate embed the data with \ncohere re-rank it with cohere or like \nvisualize over the rise like I want to \nsee this like combination of all these \nthings together and so I think like um \nyou know with with like a CRM this has \nkind of been you know when when Bob was \nfirst like pitching like you know \nexplaining his vision for generative \nfeedback loops this kind of idea of like \num personalization has always been like \nthat I just I love that like we when we \ndeveloped a blog post it was like Airbnb \nlistings and it's like write an \nadvertisement for Connor who travels \nwith his dog Bowen or Bob who's a power \nlifter and he's like a special kind of \ngym and so it's like uh this kind of \nthing of like um you know why would uh \ndeep set be interested in my gorilla \nblog posts like you know help me you \nknow come up with something for me right \nand so that that's where I see like crms \nand you know like thinking about the \nother agents in your system \nwith the future of like API design and \nyeah and I think the tricky part there \nright is the routine systems because now \nwe need all these routers and it's like \nit's kind of funny that \nthese concepts are returning that people \nhaven't really had to think about for \nyears you know like since the you know \nthe initiation of the web so now you \nhave this now you have rooters in the \nsense of for for large language models \nand you know sending things to I suppose \nin a way you kind of call them the right \nexperts or whatever \num \nand but you kind of still need this \nrouting system on top \num and I think that that's a problem I'm \nworking on like today trying to figure \nout like trying to figure out when when \nis the right time to use a router \num how like why should you use one and \nthen if if they're talking to \nwith these experts like the the ones \nyou're using how do you represent what \nthat expert which which expert can do \nwhat you know is it just like a is it a \ndescriptor or does the can this router \nactually go out there and talk to these \nexperts and say which of these ex which \nof you is the you know it can provide \nthe best candidate answer to my question \nyeah yeah it's just you're in I had just \nsharing Tianjin from Berkeley the \nauthors of girl I asked them the same \nexact question like are we going to need \nto have a hierarchy of gorillas like \nyeah I feel like just um I I guess it's \nlike um well for what we've done so far \nwith the graphql apis I can fit all of \nthat into you know it's it's 46 apis but \nit's like uh you know there there are \nAtomic apis and then we get a lot of \nsome compositionality like how you \ncombine like you know Vector search with \na wear filter limit the results see the \nobject Vector so you know like you could \nfit all the atomic apis in the prompt \nwith some explanation of how the \ncompositionality works and if you give \nthat to gbt4 obviously use the strongest \nthing you can to see if it works at all \nand then like that yeah yeah and then \nthat could give you like the natural \nlanguage command to then hand to the you \nknow smaller more economical weviate \ngorilla so yeah that's how I kind of see \nthat thing and I guess if I can ask one \nmore question on the crms thing because \nI really like exploring this idea is \nlike I feel like with business kind of \nlike the most effective thing you can do \nis kind of like try to make a lot of \npeople more success right like and it \nkind of like I feel like tree of \nthoughts this kind of like planning \ncould have such an interesting \nintersection with these CRM kind of \nthings where it's like \num you know like I have these different \nprojects that I could pursue right and \nit's like if for each of these ideas you \nknow the these like CRM reasoners could \nlike you know go in and say okay well \ndeep set probably wouldn't get too much \nout of that streamlit might get \nsomething out of that and then like put \nit all together and then say hey Connor \nI've done the analysis I think you \nshould do this project \nyeah I mean that that's like that's a \nwe've kind of had a very equivalent \nthought about around crms but \nspecifically with some of the users we \nhave in our existing core product which \nis kind of sales and marketing people \nwhich is you know they feed us \num a list of accounts from from their \nCRM and we help them \npick which ones are the best ones for \nthem to Target you know to to do their \njob the best and to have the highest \num efficiency and success rate so if you \nthink about a reasoning agent there \nwhat tactic does is we pull back in our \ncore applications we pull back \ninformation and data we extract data \nabout all these companies so reasonably \nyou could hypothesize that using a CRM \nand then you know using uh you know if \nyou specify out like a kind of a \na prompter some kind of reasoning around \nwhat ideal customers look like you \nshould be able to allow this thing you \ncould feasibly have like a Chain of \nThought going on looking at these \naccounts the knowledge you have about \nthem and reasoning giving you like the \ngiving like a you know you're a \nsalesperson you're an account you you \nknow account exec you're going to be \ncalling people tomorrow you might come \nback in tomorrow morning nine o'clock \nand you check your CRM and you have like \na list of today's Target accounts and \nthen you have reasonings why and you \nhave like some explanations in your CRM \nbeing like we want to I think you should \ntalk to this person at this company \nbecause uh this change has just occurred \nthey've just hired this you know this \nchange has happened in the market \nthat'll be really cool and I I don't I I \ndon't think stuff like that is you know \ntoo far off to be honest you know we've \nexplored parts of that so \nyeah I guess maybe the biggest part with \nthat is um maybe it's I mean you know \nthe whole uh connecting data to \nalleviate that's exploding like you know \nwe um we just did a podcast with David \ngarnets from Vector flow you know \nthere's uh unstructured we did a podcast \nwith and there are a few that we're \ntalking about but this like how do you \nyou know like how do I keep Charles's \nlast week updated in my CRM right like \nyeah yeah it's really interesting yeah \nyeah it's such a cool topic I love \nthinking about kind of the future of \ncrms because I I do feel like that would \nbe the big thing is like if we could \njust better organize business better \norganize our effort better coordinate \neveryone sort of right like it it's kind \nof I mean yeah like I love thinking \nabout the multi-agent perspective of LMS \nof like not necessarily like yes \nelements but like you know the the way \nthat things work sort of like it needs \nto you need at the end of the day your \nthing your building needs to like appeal \nto a person otherwise yes yeah 100 like \nI think \nyou can kind of tie that back to what we \nwere talking about at the start with \neven with tactically generate in terms \nof workflows you know people you know \nlike leaving the land of just talking in \nterms of Agents uh what llms are trying \nto do is or the value I think that you \nknow people see in them and investors \nseeing them is that everyone has all \nthese workers out there have these \nworkflows and there's repetition Within \nThese workflows and there's tasks that \nneed to be done and these workflows can \nalso be defined somewhat \nso using these models you know the the \nidea is make workers more efficient by \nautomating the parts of this these \nworkflows that can be automated and \nthere are Parts in there and by actually \ndoing that when we make when we automate \naway \num these parts you make workers more \nproductive by allowing them a lot more \nof the the deeper the deeper thoughts \nthe more complex parts of their job and \nI think that's that's where we see \num the power in llms is that you know we \nknow that there's people out there that \nhave processes that they work through \nand it's like okay how do we like best \ncapture capture those and like you know \njust solve the the parts of that that \naren't enjoyable or that are just real \ntime suckers you know the things that \nreally take up take up your time and I \nthink any everyone in most Industries \ncould like if they think about it can be \nlike what what do I still do every week \nthat's manual and there's always \nsomething so something out there that's \nlike a manual research thing that people \ndo and of course anyone can build their \nown \num if you have the if you have the \nknowledge you can build your own you \nknow really intelligent kind of \nautomation around that so what we're \ntrying to do is build those four people \nand you know a lot of that will actually \nend up as well being Integrations on in \ninwards and outwards Integrations you \nknow like you know we take in data from \nGitHub from Salesforce and we export it \nto you know wherever so that kind of \nflow as well will be really important \nyou know integrating with a lot of \ncommon workflows for people \nyeah that's amazing I just imagine how \nmuch everyone will be super charged by \nthat because it's like \nit's like not only do you have your own \nassistant that kind of manages like you \nyou have six emails today you have this \nme like how you might think about like a \n1970s secretary now it like uh could \neven organize it could even like \nschedule your like you know I have you \nback to back with Charles and say I have \nsomeone else working on a similar \nproject because like it wouldn't be too \nmuch of a context switch for you to then \ntalk to someone else similar to Charles \nand or like you wake up and it's like \nyou have this meeting and here's why you \nknow like \nit can be something as simple as you \nknow you've been away I was I was away \non holidays last week so you know I come \nback and I I just want to know what's \nbeen going on in my slack you know and I \nknow the fields out there that you know \nthat they already do to that but that's \none integration so how do you build a \ntool that can kind of build those \nIntegrations for everything \nand repeat that and this is where you \nknow and the questions you know uh a \ntech person or an engineering person \nmight ask a slack might be very \ndifferent to what someone in go to \nmarket go to market function would want \nto ask \num and again you know extrapolate that \nto GitHub and what a CTO might want to \nknow about you know what how their team \nhas been getting on and what bugs have \nbeen occurring and you know imagine you \ncould ask okay what bugs have been \noccurring and like what parts of the \ncode are these occurring in and like \nthat might help you realize oh and we \nneed some better testing on like this \npart of our database or sorry this part \nof our code repo because bugs are like \nconsistently occurring there and you you \nknow you could always discover that via \nyour own analysis but these are things \nyou can actually automate a way as well \nwe think \nyeah that is the killer that that's \nreally that's really exciting I mean \njust yeah like testifying from with \nweavier and trying to keep up with \neverything that happens in the slack and \nthen yeah and then also trying to tie \nthat to the code base which is itself \nlike an entire like city of complexity \nyeah oh yeah yeah I understand I \nunderstand the band I think anyone \nthat's worked on any kind of project \nthat's going in complexity knows you \nknow I recently looked at the weba code \nbase and I had looked I'd worked on a \ntiny bit you know maybe two years ago \nsmall contributions I was like oh wow \nit's completely different I I had \nthousands of commits to pull down when I \nchange my job so yeah yeah but yeah that \nthat um the that that would probably be \none of the biggest applications of that \ngenerative feedback loop thing I think \nis think is uh summarizing the slack \nso I one more question I wanted to end \nwith from our talk uh you know a year \nand a half ago we were talking about uh \nwe talked pretty heavily about graph \nembeddings and knowledge graphs and I \nwant to hear like where is your \nsentiment on that now I'm I'm still I'm \nstill long on on graph embeddings I \nthink they're like I think this back to \nwhat I was saying earlier and that \nthere's like there's expensive ways to \ndo things and llms are an expensive \nHammer brilliant and that's great but I \nthink uh in order to really connect data \nthat's not just language and you know \nthat are kind of topics and objects and \nuh I think that's where graphs graph \nembeddings are still going to or graph \nmodels are going to take off or like \nthat they will be relevant \nwhat I saw in the last week which was \nkind of cool \num is a lot more people working on \ngenerating graphs from llms and I we \ntalked really briefly about this I think \nmaybe two years ago I kind of discussed \nthat but we're probably now in a place \nwhere that is \nway more feasible and that you say to a \nmodel \nhere's a here's an article uh just write \nme every single here's the set of \nrelationships that we can have \num between objects and and here's the \nset of objects types that can exist or \nnode types that can exist just send me \nsend me in whatever graph format because \nthere's like a million graph formats out \nthere but just send me send me whatever \nI want in like you know head relation \ntail format all the relations you see in \nin this text and then you can slowly \nbuild up like a a graph database then of \nall of these things and then you could \nfurther train this to to model the \nlatent space of these and that that \nwould be a much cheaper way in my \nopinion than to build like a a Knowledge \nGraph understanding of you know what's \ngoing on in your data without having to \nllm absolutely everything and build my \nopen AI bill \nso I still I I do I I do probably I \nwould say graph stuff graph embeddings \nhas probably not probably fallen out of \nthe Limelight a little bit within the \nlast year or two just because of how \nhow easy \num llms have made it to do a lot of the \ntasks people were looking looking to \nthose for but I do think that um \nthere's a lot of value in them and I I \nI've still used them for little projects \nover the last year or so and I just \nthink it's quite amazing actually when \nyou see them train how like those little \nlatent spaces of graphs is just so cool \nto me still so yeah I still I still have \na I have quite a bit of belief in them \nstill \nyo I guess um \nfor me the um like the connection of \ngraphs and then causal inference has \nalways been what keeps me interested in \nthis topic more than anything else \nbecause I like earlier I mentioned that \num you know I get my new week of Twitter \nand basically the question I'm asking in \nmy own head is does any of this news \nchange my world model of how things work \nand and then thus how how I'm planning \nto spend my time because of my belief \nand how things are and so I do think \nlike if you extracted you know and it's \nlike the comparison across documents \nthing if you extract the structure of \nthe you know relation uh entity relation \nentities and then you know compare them \nwith each other it might be a more \nefficient way of saying this document \ndisagrees with this other document \ncompared to just looping through with \nthe llm being like does this paragraph \noccur this one actually really good \npoint because there is you know a \nwell-known \nwell-known problem class in graphs is \nnot just no classification but also like \ngraph classification and graph \ncomparison so if you're building up sub \ngraphs um I think reasonably compare a \ngenerated graph versus a generated graph \nand you know have a similarity score \noff of that which is again cheaper than \nllming that straight out of the box you \nknow \nyeah well I think there is so much that \nI mean I guess it's like like \nI guess one thing that I'm really \ninterested in is like if uh some \nsomething happens that changes \neverything in your document before then \nthen what do you do about that kind of \nand \nyeah I know the whole thing is pretty \ninteresting I mean yeah graph embeddings \nI guess here would be my question about \ngraph embeddings that I've struggled \nwith is I really like this idea of like \nI have all my documents and I connect \nthem with symbolic structure and maybe I \npropagate that to have better embedding \nsomehow but then how do I put my query \ninto the graph as well \nso how do you query the graph yeah so we \nI actually have done stuff on this in \nthe past \num \nand \nthere's like I think there's like a \ncouple of there's like a couple of ways \nin which is like \nyou could if you're like embedding a \ngraph into \nlet's say I'm creating like a evade \ninstance and the the vector embedding is \nlike an actual graph well then what I \ncould have is like the query \nthe query could link to \num some textual representation I have of \nlike an object in that graph and then \nfrom there I could resolve that down to \nlike an item within the graph so let's \nsay let's say you know I search I want \nto discover films uh about Ben Affleck \nwell then the query might be Ben Affleck \nI have a text object that I know \nresolves to the resolve that down to \num the maybe it doesn't have to be one \nbut resolve that down to like a couple \nof nodes so one of them might be Ben \nAffleck one might be the you know the \nBatman films and from there then you can \ntry and return relevant results from \nfrom that graph back \num but resolving natural language to \nthat's one idea maybe I had for I have \nfor how you could resolve natural \nlanguage that back down \num to graph embeddings but I know it is \na tricky thing \num \num because it doesn't naturally \ntranslate right you know they're very \nvery abstract Concepts like an item or a \nnode embedding \nyeah I heard that same idea from uh \nProfessor Laura Dietz from the \nUniversity of New Hampshire was on the \npodcast and yeah she she explained that \nsame kind of idea of uh you know you \ncould like retrieve with the embeddings \nand then re-rank with the graph or vice \nversa and yeah it does sound like a \npretty cool way of doing it yeah awesome \nCharlotte's been such an interesting \npodcast let me ask you one one more big \nquestion which is uh oh actually sorry \nbefore this \nI'm very curious because you're building \nyou know an actual product with llms and \nI'm very curious um where your sentiment \nis on the Llama CPP ggml this kind of \nlike um you know would you replace gbt4 \nwith llama 2 with those kind of \ninference libraries what would it take \nfor the Tipping Point to hit \num I think it's probably more a matter \nof like when if it when we're gonna do \nthis \num and I think it also is kind of use \ncase dependent but you know a big \naspiration of ours that we're going to \ndo is we're going to have an Enterprise \noffering of this where we'll we'll Host \nthis model for you we'll get that set up \nand this I spoke about it briefly but in \nthat world it's not going to be gpt4 \nit's not going to be whatever it's going \nto be those models are going to have to \nbe you know on someone else's on someone \nsome someone that we're hosting this as \nfar as Cloud you know on their AWS \ninstance it's going to have to be their \nmodel it's gonna their data can't leave \ntheir AWS uh VPN or a VPC I should say \nthis is going to stay within there and \nin that world when we get to those \nbecause we want to help those kind of \nEnterprise customers out that have this \nkind of they want to use what tactic \ngenerate can do but the data can't leave \nand when we get to solving those \nproblems that's where we know we're \ngoing to have to to use these types of \nmodels and you know we're we're very \nwell aware of that and we're we're \nworking on it looking at llama and we're \nsaying we're kind of having we have our \nplan of action for \nwhen we need to execute that we're ready \nto go and kind of deploying those at \nthat version of that of tactic generate \nto do that when we need it \nyeah that's super interesting to hear \nyeah I think like what Amazon is doing \nwith that is really interesting I also \nwe had a podcast with Rohit Agarwal from \nportkey and I think kind of this um like \nload balancing between the LM apis \nmanaging updating it and taking one down \nI think there's another software layer \nin between there and yeah that sounds \nsuper interesting so so yeah let me ask \nyou kind of the big uh kind of \nconcluding podcast question which is uh \nlike what is sort of the thing that is \non the frontier that excites you the \nmost \nwow that is a big question \num \nwhat's on the frontier that excites me \nthe most \nokay I would say \num \nI'm \nI'm a big I I read a lot I like a lot of \ncreative things so I'm really excited to \nsee \nhow creative models can really become \nthe point where not that it's like a \nnovel novelty interesting I wanna I \nwanna see some \nI want to see stuff generated by models \nthat's like you know you know effects \naffects you like the way a good book or \na good film would affect you I I and I \nthink you know people might laugh at \nthat now or they might find it kind of \nfunny but you know the very first four \nyears ago or whenever gpt2 came out I \nfine-tuned a model on scripts film \nscripts I was able to generate film \nscripts and I thought that was amazing \nand now GPT 3.5 can do that with barely \nany specific fine tuning on that so the \nfact that that's like the change that \noccurs in like three four years I think \nyou know probably in very less than \nthree years three years being a high \nconservative estimate you're probably \ngoing to see \nsome really cool art being \num created by these models I don't know \nwhat the modality will be \num but something will happen so that's \nlike kind of a fun one of the fun cool \nthings that I'm I'm waiting to see \nhappen where people are very happy to \nconsume media that's generated by these \nthings \num \nnot maybe not all of it but I that's \nsomething I'm looking forward to and I \nthink it's going to happen so \nyeah I agree completely it sounds so \nexciting I mean I I've always liked \nthinking about like I always talk about \nthis as like compositional \ngeneralization like the avocado shaped \narmchair is like the concept of avocado \ncomposed with armchair and yeah I think \nI guess there's like that trying to \nthink too hard about like what it means \nto be new art right and then there's \nlike I I like the I like this other kind \nof you know people who are skeptical of \nAI art and stuff where they say you know \nthere's quite a lot to the human \nconnection to it like I like this Travis \nScott song not just because it sounds \ngood but it's also like he's putting his \nbrand his reputation behind it and \nthere's something like kind of like this \npodcast right like you and I are both \nlike you know humans behind the content \nsort of yeah so like where where I kind \nof fall on that is like 100 degree you \nknow I like to read especially you know \nif it's you can feel something personal \nin there or whatever it is but the \ncompositional aspect I still would think \nwill probably still exist in there right \nyou know \nif you probably showed songwriters the \nequipment that's available nowadays for \npeople to create music they would maybe \nsay something similar which is like \nthat's not creating music because \nthey're not using real instruments or \nit's not you know that that wasn't \nthat's not a real piano that's not a \nreal keyboard it's not a real drum it's \ngenerated or it comes from a key like a \ncomputer so \npeople are going to still have to like \nprompt these these stories in a certain \nway um or there's gonna have to be there \nwill be some sort of thing in there that \nlike will be some compositional element \nand I think I think humans will you're \ngonna have people that are better \ncomposers of these tools than others and \nI maybe maybe that's where we'll see \num people kind of have their foot \nfingerprint \num putting their stamp on on their own \nart with this \num but yeah who knows \nyeah that's awesome Charles and Charles \nthank you so much for coming back on the \nweba podcast is such a fun chat I \nlearned so much and I hope everyone \nlistening checks out uh tactic generate \nit is you know I think we already kind \nof talked about it thoroughly but I'd \nsay it's like the same way perplexity is \nyou know bringing together search and \nLMS you're bringing together kind of \nlike multiple personal documents and \nthis interface it's super cool so I hope \neveryone checks it out and Charles thank \nyou so much again thank you so much it \nmeans a lot cheers thank you \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Charles Pierse on Tactic Generate - Weaviate Podcast #69!", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_nyz1xs9AU", "timestamp": "",
