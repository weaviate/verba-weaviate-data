{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the 72nd episode of the Weaviate Podcast with Madelon Hulsebos!! Madelon is ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching another episode of the weeva \npodcast I'm super excited to welcome Dr \nmateline holos one of the world's \nleading scientists on table \nrepresentation learning and \nunderstanding structure and AI I think \nthis is just one of the most exciting \ntopics I'm so excited to talk to maton \nthank you so much for joining the \npodcast wow fantastic Conor thank you so \nmuch for the invitation and great great \nto be here just one correction I'm not a \ndoctor yet oh sorry no no no I'm about \nto actually hand in my te is NE today so \nuh no it's almost accurate almost that's \nawesome yeah I I actually had the same \nthing where I did I submitted my \ndissertation and then did a podcast with \nBob like right after so awesome glad to \nbe a part of that but so it's successful \ntiming I guess right yeah yeah yeah so \nso this topic of table representation \nlearning I think this is just so \nexciting I've been trying to understand \nthe role of structure in Vector search \nfor so long and I think kind of the the \nquestion I'd want to kind of set set the \nstage with is to understand you know \ntabular data it's always has this \nNarrative of you know all the world's \nmost of the world's data is in tables \nand people have this mix of like numeric \ncategorical features that they organize \nand to just kind of understand like um \nthe intersection of that in embeddings \nand how you kind of see \nthat um well I think in terms of the \nintersection of of tables and embeddings \nI \nthink I think it's always been very \nconfusing to people um as people well I \nthink now most of the research has been \nfocused on you know language embeddings \nand just you know a very raw raw text \nembeddings and and then um everyone is \nof course very keen to adopt such \ntechniques and models and embeddings \ndirectly for tabular \ndata but I think what has been often \nmisunderstood is that tabular data isn't \nas simple as as just text um so there \nare many intersections though between \nthe two and of course many tables also \ncontain text but as you said there is \njust a lot of structure in tables you \nknow columns all relate to each other \nrows relate to each other um but they \nhave also very specific properties uh \nthat we I'm sure will get to in a later \nstage um but yeah I think it's it's a \nhard Challenge and interesting challenge \nto also see how we can tailor all these \nyou know representation learning \ntechniques towards embedding for example \nnumeric data as well and see how they \ncan perhaps complement each \nother yeah well I I and I I think I \ndidn't mean to limit it just to \nembeddings I mean kind of this whole \nidea of machine learning on tables and I \nknow things like you know table tosql is \none of these topics that we'll cover in \nthe podcast and so I guess that kind of \nidea I want to explore more like so \nembeddings of numeric properties so \nmaybe like you have a patient electronic \nhealth record and you'd have like an \nembedding for the age attribute so is \nthis is this kind of the thinking like \nyou you take like a a table row that \nwould describe you know electronic \nhealth record maybe just to stay in that \none and instead of maybe translating it \nto text and sort of putting the text \ntranslation of the tabular row into like \nopen AI embeddings you instead have some \nway of learning representations for \ntabular \npatients ah yeah so I think there are \nquite some flavors to to this task one \nof them is indeed for tabular machine \nlearning where indeed you have rowwise \nembeddings and want to perform some kind \nof classification task on top of that so \nthat's one big field that is now \nactually coming up with um pre-trained \nmodels such as step pfn very interesting \ninteresting to to check that out it was \nuh coming out last year um and you can \njust use such embedding models on top of \nindeed for example healthc care data to \nclassify for example diseases perhaps \nalthough it's of course um well relevant \nto First evaluate that on specific uh \nuse cases and domains um but then \nthere's also another field that is that \nhas been training these models across \nlike Millions of tables to for example \nuh retrieve embeddings to service the \nsemantics of columns for example to \ngenerate metadata so you know if you \nwant to build a data model and um \nperform for example data validation on \nall such columns that you know contain \nage ages for example of patients um it's \nvery relevant to understand how you know \ndifferent kind of tables relate to each \nother so what actually I've seen a lot \nis that different Healthcare Providers \nthey want to integrate different sources \nof tables um of their data and then they \nwant to integrate this data together but \nbecause everyone has different concepts \nto refer to ages for example and \ndifferent ways to specify such \nattributes it's very hard to map a \ncolumn of Ages in one table to another \num so this is a very interesting use \ncases that can be uh performed if you \nhave you know accurate semantic \nembeddings of table columns for \nexample yeah I think as I was studying \nyour work and learning about this kind \nof semantic type detection for columns \nthat was quite new for me to to have \nthis idea of you're looking through a \ntable and you're like what is this \ncolumn uh talking about right is I'm \nalmost like I'm I'm very like kind of at \nthe crossroads of where to go next in \nour conversation because we could talk \nmore about this kind of column uh type \ndetection or that idea of like table \nembeddings like not just individual \npatient level but searching through the \nwhole the whole table I find that to be \nso fascinating so yeah maybe if uh we \ncould stay on the type detection we'll \ncome back to the whole table embedding \nlevel but this this semantic type \ndetection can you just kind of yeah like \nthe beginning because I imagine this is \nkind of new for a lot of \npeople yeah so I think one of the the \nthe key top asks in many data management \nand many data analysis applications is \ndriven by the semantics of columns so \nindeed you know what do columns really \nrepresent what's in that column um in \nlike real world Concepts so for example \nwith the with the example of Ages you \nwant to label that with like \nstandardized semantic types age address \nand there are like millions of different \ntypes that you can think of but then all \nin a standardized way and this is \nactually a key task for table \ncomprehension so basically table \nunderstanding as you might also see for \nexample analogous to for example images \nwhere you have object detection you want \nto understand you know if there is a you \nknow a cat in an image or something like \nthat you want to have something similar \nfor tables to understand what these \ntables actually contain but this can \nalso be used for for example data \nDiscovery um if you have accurate \nembeddings or representations of columns \num and you can generate metadata such as \nsemantic column types from that then you \ncan use it also for data Discovery for \nexample or gener recommending data \nvisualizations for specific tables um \ngiven that the tables contain certain \nsemantic \ntypes yeah I think the timing on that is \namazing with snowflake acquiring Ponder \nand I listened to Doris Lee things like \nStanford seminar this like kind of uh \ndata Discovery like kind of uh \nrecommendations on analyses and \nvisualizations of your data and I guess \nI'm I'm so just so curious like I I've \nseen your work on git tables where \nyou've extracted millions of csvs from \nGitHub very cool I love the data \ncollection is always awesome but so so \nyou have all these tables and now you're \nnow you're trying to say I know like \nmaybe two three out of the five \ncolumns try to use that in the values to \ninfer the type of the fourth one maybe \nhelp me further understand just kind of \nlike the application of the type \ndetection of the column and sort of the \nthe context it sits \nin um so ideally we want to train \nmachine learning models over all these \ntables to perform for example semantic \ntype \ndetection um labeling table columns with \nsemantic types and we want to do that \nalso for new and unseen \ntables so that's basically the idea and \nwe can do that in of course very \ndifferent ways you can even just look at \nthe header so for example the column \nname um but the the values in these \ncolumns are very you know they provide \nvery important signal to what these \ncolumns are about of course so typically \nwe try to embed full columns um to \npredict the semantic type of \nit yeah I'm I'm so maybe looking at the \ndistribution of the values and so yeah \nwith that kind of thinking I'm very \ncurious like how language models and \nsort of you know chaining maybe you you \nhave like how you can call the pandas \nfunctions like DF do describe is kind of \nlike a common function that like gives \nyou all these views of your data and \npandas how have kind of the language \nmodels help with that interpreting what \na column is in the characteristics of \ncall well I think that's a that's a very \ninteresting one and basically where \nwhere I myself started off with um was \nwith word embedding so assuming that \nmany tables actually contain textual \ndata and this is a severe limitation \nactually of this approach um what we did \nback then is just trying to map every \ncell value in a column to I think back \nthen we had like glove embed things um \nso we basically try to to aggregate all \nkinds of word \nfactors extracted from from column \nvalues now I think there is you know \nwith representation learning and um this \nhas been extended to tables as well with \ntable representation learning we see \nthat typically what what what is well \nmost common to do is serialize entire \ncolumn columns like cell by cell into a \nsequence and then provide it to language \nmodels basically and there are kinds of \nlike adaptations of the me uh attention \nmechanism to also learn for example \nrelations across different rows across \ndifferent columns so there are many like \ntailored approaches to adapt such uh \nlanguage models to tables as well and \nthis is super cool this has enabled \nactually very interesting applications \nfor you know Beyond table comprehension \nso beyond semantic type detection this \nhas enabled for example question \nanswering fact verification over tables \nand it's really really super cool to see \nthat um but of course there are also \nlimitations to such \napproaches yeah I think it would be a \nreally nice transition to asking more \nabout your work on that kind of uh table \nbased question answering I think we've \nseen a lot of uh kind of like in the \nretrieval augmented generation tooling \nWorld we've seen a lot of text tosql \nkind of things and yeah if you could \njust continue on how you see that table \nbased question answering uh \napplication yeah I think it's so one of \nthe driving forces of uh git tables was \nactually that most of these models for \nexample um uh pre-trained table models \nfor question answering they have been \ntrained on tables from the web um and \nassuming certain structures of tables \nthat were slightly shortsighted so \nthere's you know so many specifics to \ntables that uh you cannot just you know \nassume these models to to uh work with \nout of the box um but for question \nanswering what what I've seen is \nthat um when you try to serialize these \num these columns and rows one thing that \nis typically missed is that there is you \nknow for example properties such as row \norders insignificance and column order \ninsignificance about in databases so in \nrelational tables and what what is \ninteresting about these these current \npre-trained Table models for question \nanswering is that they can be very \nsensitive to such characteristics so one \nof the the driving forces of for for \nexample get tables but also um more \nanalysis uh work that we've been doing \nwith for example \nObservatory um is to try to figure out \nhow well these table embedding models \ngeneralize to different applications and \ndifferent data bases and I think one of \nthe shortcomings now is that well we \nhave many steps to make still when it \ncomes to scalability so these models \nhave been trained on well relatively \nsmaller scale um data sets of tables now \nvery recently a huge table uh collection \nhas been introduced as well by \napproximate Labs very cool to to see \nwhere that is going um this data set is \ncalled \ntlib and then I hope that these models \nwill also become more robust for example \nto uh for example small semantic \nperturbations in tables so what we've \nseen with Observatory is that which is \nan analysis tool for um trying to \nunderstand what table embeddings how \nrobust they are \nbasically um one of the things we found \nthere is that if you make very small \nchanges to for example the question you \nask um or the table that you ask a \nquestion on even though the semantic so \nthe meaning of the question remains the \nsame um they don't really capture that \nwell and I assume that when we skill \nsuch models up \nthat you know as with large language \nmodels these models will also become \nmore robust to such semantic variations \nfor \nexample I think with me I'm trying to \nunderstand um like the the the language \nmodel kind of uses like uh pandas or SQL \napis to kind of answer symbolic \nquestions like it could take in the \nschema of the table and then it can \nformat like you know select from where \nlike the the CLA and so I'm trying to \nunderstand like how you would have uh \nlike instead passing the table directly \nto a machine learning model that would \noutput some kind of uh \nanswer you you mean if if that is what \nwe should be \ndoing yeah I guess um sorry if this is \nisn't super bow form but I'm trying to \nunderstand that I guess for me it's like \num these tabular machine learning models \nI guess they take as they take as input \na table \nright or maybe a a a row and and then \nproduce the answer based on you know by \nprocessing the table with some kind of \nlike maybe columnwise attention and this \nkind of thing and so I'm just really \ncurious how that differs from say uh \njust interfacing my large language model \nwith like a pandas or SQL API where it \ncan um if it if it's doing symbolic a I \nguess like if it's doing symbolic \naggregation like what's the average age \nof country music singers I I say that a \nlot now I guess but like then you know \nit just has to like select from the \nsinger's table where genre equals \ncountry music right so I guess that that \nkind of yeah indeed so these Pro this \nthis problem of question answering uh \nspecifically has been approached from \ntwo directions indeed one mapping \nnatural language questions to SQL and \nthen executing that on a given table \nwhere of course the table schema is \nintegrated into that uh because you need \nto understand or need to map the like \nSQL attributes to a to a given column I \nthink that's actually a very very good \napproach to take and it's I think a very \nlogical one also given the sequence to \nsequence uh modeling approaches that we \nthat we currently have um and I think \nwe'll we'll \nsee what I I think it's a it's a very \ninteresting approach um to take but it's \nit's of course also limited I think um \nwith what applications you can serve \nwith that \num but I think the the other approach of \nI think they they kind of relate to each \nother uh as well a lot um but for \nexample for fact verification where you \nwant to \num give a fact or check a a given fact \nagainst a certain table then we might \nneed different embedding and different \napproaches \num to this problem um but I think text \nto SQL \num I think it it works well for \nrelatively simple basic cases at the \nmoment and I'm really keen on seeing how \nwell it works if our queries our \nquestions become way more complex and \nvery recently there's a new Benchmark \nintroduced that actually tests text to \nSQL models \nfor way more complicated schemas but \nalso more complicated questions because \nso far we've been only working with with \nvery small questions on a single table \nand I think as soon as you want to you \nknow ask more complicated questions on \nyour data then it will become much \nharder to generate relevance \nequel yeah I think that's so inter I \nI've studied a little bit of like the \nspider data set for text tosql and I I I \nhave a bit of experience with this \nbecause I've been working on the uh text \nto graphql gorilla with we v8's graphql \nAPI and so yeah this this thinking of \nlike these complex schemas like with we8 \nwe kind of have like a collections like \nabstraction where you have like a uh you \nknow like student teacher book these are \nlike separate classes and so it's like \nyou'd only retrieve kind of one schema \nat a time to format the query for one \nschema hopefully that makes sense but \nlike if you're if if you're like joining \nI can imagine like complex join is where \nthis problem gets really difficult and I \nactually think that would be a really \nnice transition into the embeddings of \ntables as a whole because I imagine \nthere's maybe something to the Joint \nkind of with what you were saying \nearlier with um I have this electronic \nhealth record where I have patients and \nI have age is one of my column values \nmaybe want to try to join this to some \nother table but I'm not sure what which \ntable right so I need to kind of like \nsearch through tables to maybe do that \nkind of \njoins yeah I think especially for for \nsuch cases you really need to embed the \nunderlying data as well you just mapping \ncolumn names to um natural questions and \nlike generate SQL queries from that I \nthink won't work um if you want to for \nexample integrate data from very \ndifferent sources um so I'm I think \nthere's actually a later a newer \nBenchmark called bird and birds really \nprovides more complicated queries that \nall these models really really uh find \nchallenging so I think it's really \ninteresting to see that such \napplications will will you know Empower \nus to ask natural language questions \nover our data but there are definitely \nmany many challenges ahead also when it \ncomes to for example um the input limit \num if you want to embed tables that's a \nthat's a sever \nElation um because of the amount of \ncontext that you can provide um if you \nwould then need to scale up um across \ndifferent different tables this becomes \nalready quite \nchallenging yeah I think that there \nthere's so much that I want to keep I I \nI guess I really like this kind of like \nwhen I thought back about like \nelectronic health records and embedding \npatient rows I really like that kind of \nrag where you would retrieve similar \npatients and then maybe have that kind \nof you know the supplement in the \ninputting input that comes from that \nyeah I guess um yeah I kind of want to \nstay more on these um complex questions \nthis text to SQL thing and I'm very \ncurious about this kind of like um uh \nlike query execution planning like I I \ndon't know too much about how SQL does \nthis but I I know that there's like a \nlot of underlying mechanics to like how \nto optimally uh do a query do you think \nabout this kind of thing as well and how \num machine learning could help yes yes \nthat's a that's a great question I have \nbeen thinking about this a lot um but I \nhaven't been working on this and to be \nhonest I think no one really has so I \nbut there are so many opportunities I \nthink when it comes to query \noptimization as well but this is just \nyou know gas work at the moment and \nneeds more experimentation but I think \nthere are very interesting opportunities \nwhen it comes to for example cashing or \nuh you know as you said um yeah I think \nthat's an interesting um direction to \nexplore \nfurther super cool so uh kind of \npivoting topics a little bit I kind of \nwant to talk about um the kind of I'm \nvery curious like what you think about \ngraph neural networks because I've heard \nyou talk about like columnwise attention \nand these kind of particular \narchitectures for tables and relations \nand I think you know graph networks it's \nlike \nalways trying to figure out what what \nit's going to be uh what that's going to \nbecome I have seen some interesting \napproaches um that indeed use graph \nneural networks \nto try to model the relationships and \ntables and I think they are very success \nthey can be successful but I have I I \nmust admit that I'm personally not a big \nfan of of GRA networks themselves \num I don't know why it's just something \nthat you know I don't know it hasn't \nreally taken off so far I think um but \ndefinitely there are different ways to \nalso you know perceive tables and you \ncan also see them as you know they can \nbe well represented by crafts as well so \nI think there's definitely value in that \num but I haven't looked into this \nmyself yeah I I guess it's it almost is \nlike I guess with the graph Network you \nneed to have like the whole graph is \ninput and I always thought that was kind \nof like it makes the inference kind of \nuh challenging and so I guess kind of \nanother thing I'm curious about is your \ncurrent sentiment on on like XG boost \nand like especially in kind of like \nsearch and recommendation that like \nhaving a symbolic features about your \ncustomers to then like rerank your \nsearch results with an XG boost model is \nquite a popular thing and so yeah \ngenerally I'd love to just get your take \non \nEX I think it it was super interesting \nlast year um we organized this Workshop \ntable representation learning for the \nfirst time at \nNubs and by then I've been mostly \nfocusing on data management applications \nwhere we were more interested in the \nsemantics of data in generating metadata \nwith for example semantic column types \nthen when we organized this Workshop um \npeople really related this to HG boost \ndirectly anything on tables people think \nlike no but actually \nyou know outperforms anything and I was \nlike oh but this is a different task you \nknow that's rwise inference and not \nnecessarily \num you know across you know generating \nGeneral metadata from from different \ntables and I think now we see that these \nfields actually approach each other \nwhereas for example actually boost is \ntypically trained on one given \ntable but now as we see also um more \nrepresentation learning being effective \nfor learning relationships across \ndifferent tables for tabular like \nrowwise inference like actually boost \nand I think we see now more and more \napproaches that try to try to embed rows \nand see if that works for such cases as \nwell and I think they have been shown \nreally competitive for um against XG \nboost and other tree based um \nclassifiers so so that is super \ninteresting to to see and come together \nbecause before all these um like more \nrepresentation learning approaches they \nalso learned representations from one \ntable and now they start to explore \ntrying to learn representations and like \ntransfer semantics from other tables to \ndo this kind of inference as well and I \nthink that's a super interesting area to \nto see being \nexplored yeah I think well I'm I guess \nit's like this idea of merging tables \nand and I guess generally like this \ngeneralization of uh symbolic that that \nwould kind of be my uh why I don't \nactually prescribe people to train an XG \nboost to rerank their search results is \nbecause the generalization probably \nwon't be as good as if you uh translate \nit to text and use like a cross encoder \nthat has a text is kind of my \nperspective is that because when you \nhave the symbolic things you're like \nreally like uh the machine learning \nmodel is like really fitting to these \nlike high frequency patterns I think \ncompared to kind of text translations \nwhere you have these like Rich \nembeddings that I I think generalized \nbetter U that yeah that's kind of how I \nsee that whole like generalization of \ntabular models but I I definitely am not \nan expert on it like just from your \nperspective because you've been uh of \ncourse coming from from a different \nperspective um more on retrieval and um \nreranking so how do how do for example \ncustomers as weate use EXO to to do \nreranking I guess it with recommendation \nit's like you have like age gender maybe \npurchase history these kind of maybe \ntags and like I did some kind of like \ncustomer turn analysis and maybe I have \na tag on you based on that other Mo what \nthat other model said about you and so I \nhave all these features that I then use \nto rerank like uh the shirts I'm going \nto show you from this your home feed or \nyour search query so that that's kind of \nhow I see it mostly but I can definitely \nI'm I'm definitely starting to \nunderstand this better from listening to \nyou talk about it is this idea of like \nmaybe I have a data set of like I have \nlike my CRM data set and I you know I \nmight have come up with some columns to \ndescribe my customers with that someone \nelse from the company has different \ncolumns that they've been using right \nand now we're going to try to merge \nthese tables and it's going to be like \nis this does this column agree with this \nis this actually the same column kind of \nI guess yeah I think what is interesting \nabout the approach of representation \nlearning for tab ml across uh across \ndifferent tables is that you can \nactually learn General patterns I I can \nimagine that you know different \ncompanies although their data might be \nformatted very differently the same \npatterns might hold and be relevant in \nin other companies for example in health \nit it doesn't really matter how how the \ndata is specified if you can embed this \nand and preserve the generic factors \nhidden in these for example rows that \nmight represent patients or customers I \nthink it can transfer such you know some \npatterns from one say context to \nanother and I think that's that's an \ninteresting thing that actually boost I \nI think will not be able to do it it \njust doesn't have that you know high \ncapacity yeah that's really the well I \nthink maybe it would be really nice to \nkind of like um come into so this idea \nof transferring representations from one \ntable to the other I maybe like to have \nsome examples of visualizing it like I \nimagine maybe I go to Archive and I get \nout like all of the experimental tables \nor I know with your GitHub experiment \nhow you got millions of tables from \nGitHub could we maybe have like some \nexamples of like I guess just like a \ntransferring of table to table more \nso yeah I'm I'm thinking of um beyond \nfor example the data integration um \nproblem \num thinking \nof well what we what we might see for \nexample in in \ncertain certain health health data dat \nbases Healthcare databases you might \nfind specific patterns relating certain \nages with certain \ndiseases um and I think such such \nGeneral patterns might transfer from you \nknow from one city to another city um \nfrom one country maybe even to another \ncountry uh another I think good example \nin in that sense is you have all these \nlike open government data portals \nand there are like millions of T well \nnot Millions but like thousands of \ntables on there um and I think there are \njust general patterns to extract from \nthese tables for example um relating GDP \nwith I don't know other economic factors \nand and try to understand the world \nbetter from that and I think if we would \nwe could use such if we could embed that \nand like retrieve search data for \nexample using we8 then we could use you \nknow we could augment machine learning \nuse cases in companies for example that \nwant to use that econom economic data \nfor I don't know in inference on their \nvery specific company uh \ngoals yeah thank you so much for that \nthat really helping me understand I I've \nseen this data set called like Wiki \ntables that was like also like \nextracting any I'm really I think I'm \ndefinitely like uh my understanding of \nthe whole thing is growing as we've been \ntalking about that all these kind of \ntables and trying to merge them all \ntogether into having this view of the \nworld is so interesting and yeah I guess \nfor me I've always kind of been thinking \nabout like it's almost like with Vector \ndatabases and knowledge graphs graph \ndatabases I think about this a lot is \nlike um what's the best way to kind of \nrepresent a fact like can you just have \nlike a natural language sentence that's \nlike a fact or do you need like a you \nknow like a a knowledge graph tupal or \nlike a tabular data entry so how do you \nkind of think about just like that idea \nof um you know the the I guess the other \napproach of instead of kind of merging \ntables into a big big table I kind of \nlike translate them into facts and I try \nto see like if the facts disagree with \neach other kind of in in natural \nlanguage for like embedding based \nretrieval yeah that's a that's an \ninteresting question I think so I've \nalways been very driven by observing \nwhat data is around and how data is \nstored so one of my observations was \nthat most data is collected and stored \nconsumed through tables in relational \ndatabases for example or or perhaps less \nstructured in CSV files so I always took \nthat perspective and see that that \ntables typically drive very high value \nuse cases from ter prediction to Health \nCare Solutions and so on so I've always \nbeen very you know fond of tables \nbecause of because of that but yeah you \ncould you could also um present facts in \nin different ways but I think the power \nof tables is that they are so structured \nand they provide all these very you know \nmachine readable interfaces to it um and \nI think that makes it a very \nsuitable a suitable format um to present \ndata and facts in particular in um \nsometimes you know tabular formats have \nbeen taken a bit more flexibly so for \nexample Wikipedia now now we need to \nextract tables from Wikipedia and try to \nrestructure it in a very structured \nformat um I think if we would all \npresent it in you know very basic tables \nI think that would help a lot um and \ncould \nalso yeah I think I think tables are \njust super rich also because you can \ncomplement them with \nmetadata um you know they they come with \nSQL for example um as an interface to \nthis data and you can learn for example \npatterns across that how other people \nfor example query specific tables you \ncan learn all kinds of signals from that \num of course similar yeah similar \nprinciples or ideas hold to to less \nstructured data for example just text um \nbut I've been just coming from okay \ntables are really everywhere in \ndatabases so they're you know they they \ntake up the majority of the data \nlandscape the organizational data \nlandscape and they just serve so many \nhigh value use cases across data \nanalysis pipelines so that's actually \nwhy I've been focusing on on tables \nspecifically and structur data um but \nyeah there are different ways to to \npresenting facts and analyzing that yeah \nyeah yeah I love that I mean yeah like I \nguess uh like looking at like uh if \nyou're in the NBA and it's like who's \nthe leading rebounder I like like stats \nyou'll see it in like the tables and I \nlove that it's a good way of presenting \ndata I think that really Nails it it \nmakes me qu I'm very curious about like \nthis um you know now the language models \ncan see right with like the gbt \n4V what do you think about that kind of \nlike that that they can they can see so \nyou might want like visually give them a \ntable language models might want to pass \nvisualizations of tables to each other \nor is that like a native language but \nbut generally like I guess this concept \nof like being able to see data \nvisualization yeah I think that's a \nsuper interesting idea um and I've been \ndiscussing this with with someone this \nweek actually that you know when people \nlook at at tables they kind of grasp \ncertain patterns to to understand it and \nI definitely think that the visual \nrepresentation of a table just as an \nimage of it yeah I'm I'm I'm super \ncurious to see how this you know how \nthis can help also for for the you know \nfor embedding tables and and you know \ngetting insights from them uh I haven't \nseen much of the results I think just \none paper on this where I was like oh \nthat's that's interesting but um it's \njust in very early stages to see to see \nhow it's used I think so far um \nresearchers have been evaluating the the \ncapabilities and the \nchallenges of using large language \nmodels just without the visual um U \nmedium but and they've been trying to \nunderstand how you should best input a \ntable into for example chat GPT um how \nsensitive it is for example when you um \nask a certain question and then swap \ndifferent rows in a table so Tables by \nby default by by their nature are well \nfrom a relational perspective um the \norder of the rows is insignificant so \nthat doesn't carry meaning but some of \nthese large language models can be very \nsensitive to that just as they can be \nsensitive to very small semantic changes \nin for example column name just the the \nsame semantics but just a different word \nfor example can have actually quite some \nimpact so I think that that opens up new \nopportunities for for research and \nseeing how you know how we can \nintegrate properties of relational \ntables um into such models and I think \nthe the \nmultimodality will at some point also \nextend um to Stables but I'm I'm very \nkeen to see where this more like image P \nperspective um and the the \nrepresentation of a table from an image \nwhere that will lead lead to I'm very \ncurious to see to see \nthat yeah I'm also like um I guess \nanother question I have is how the the \nstructured like in in kind of like the \nvector search world there's this one \nidea that you have like an image of a \ndog and then you have metadata about the \nimage like you know maybe the type of \ndog the age of it or color and then You' \nmaybe like uh embed the features as well \nand maybe average these embeddings so \nyou have some embedding of like Golden \nRetriever and then you average that with \nthe image embedding for the dog um do \nyou think that kind of integration of \nlike maybe more unstructured embeddings \nwith the structured components do you \nthink that that you know that that can \nadd to the quality of the \nembedding oh for sure I think that's \nsuch an interesting comment actually um \nwith this latest project called \nObservatory we do some analysis that \nrelate to that so the notion of you know \npreserving relations between objects in \nthe embedding space and I think an \nanalogy into the relational data model \nis functional dependencies so given two \ncolumns in a in a table uh we might \nperceive certain relationships between \nthese columns so for example uh the \ncapital if you have a column with \ncapitals and a column with country then \nyou would well assuming uh you would \nalways see the same values for the same \ncountry so for example Amsterdam is the \ncapital of the Netherlands you wouldn't \nexpect other relations than that and \nwe've been \nanalyzing um table embeddings to see and \nuh particularly comum embeddings to see \nif these embeddings currently preserve \nsuch relationship as well but so far we \nhaven't seen that so and I think there \nis also from um the knowledge graph \nembedding space uh so you have for \nexample trans e uh which is a um an \napproach for preserving such \nrelationships across entities in \nknowledge graphs and I think this would \nperfectly extend also to the notional \nfunctional \ndependencies um to embed values in in \ntables and then we can use such \nembeddings if once they preserve these \nfunctional dependencies so these \nrelationships between between columns \nthen we can also better use that for \nexample for data \nimputation \num um which then serves perhaps \nDownstream a machine learning model so I \nthink there is definitely interesting \ninteractions between these two yeah \nbetween these \nfields and I think it's an interesting \nsuggestion actually perhaps more \ngenerally um to see how certain concepts \nof of tables how that can be preserved \nor how we can find such relations \nbetween certain semantic Concepts in the \nembedding space even Beyond functional \ndependencies I think that's an yeah \nthat's an interesting um approach and we \nshould definitely see if we can preserve \nsuch relationships \nsemantically yeah I think that's so \npowerful I I guess like um that this \nthis kind of yeah like you mentioned \ntrans Z that kind of like uh embedding \nof a particular kind of relationship \nlike I guess right now it's like \nsemantic similarity is just like the one \nsize fits all for all but like instead \nyou if you had some other relationship \nand then uh if you're within this radius \nthat means that you kind of uh you know \nmight also have this relationship and \nthen we store the structure of that yeah \nit's also \ninteresting yeah I think and um um one \nthing that I was interested about from \nfrom we's perspective is but this is \nperhaps a little bit off topic but I was \njust reminded of this but from a \nretrieval perspective but um what kind \nof embeddings do you do you currently \nsee so have you seen at we8 you know do \nyou have customers or I don't know users \num that actually use or retrieve \ninformation and embeddings of \ntables um I haven't seen it personally \noh well actually I do well I remember a \nconversation like I remember earlier \nthere is a bit of like um how do you \nevangelize Vector search with the uh SQL \npeople and and that was kind of an idea \nis like \num I guess back then it it was like you \nwould maybe have like an auto encoder \nand I mean this was like before the zero \nshop mod I think now the the current \nprescription would be could you \ntranslate your uh your table to text \nright to put it into these embedding \nmodels but I haven't personally seen too \nmuch of that that's why I just find this \nconversation to be so kind of like eye \nopenening to me is I I had never thought \nbefore reading your paper on G tables \nand I had never really thought about \nthis idea of searching through multiple \ntables or having you know like a million \ntables it's I think it's quite creative \nto be thinking like that and yes I would \nsay it's quite novel to search uh to to \nuse like vector search search in tabular \nstructured data I think yeah so one I \nthink Avenue interesting Avenue is now \nwith retrieval augmented uh generation \nthat if \nyou I can assume if you have very \naccurate embeddings of I don't know \nmaybe table rows or columns or maybe \neven full tables just one centic vector \nof a of a table I can imagine that if \nyou would then you know this would help \nout with with r as well uh from a WEA \nperspective I can imagine that so much \ndata is eventually stored in tables that \nis relevant to provide as context to \nllms I can imagine that that soon people \nwill start to embed their tables as well \nand I'm just super curious to see how \nyou know how they will retrieve like \nconstruct their embeddings and um Keen \nto see that unfold yeah I I think maybe \ntwo things I see on that is the first \nthing is um with weeva you define a \nschema where you define which property \nyou're going to vectorize so say I'm \nvectorizing content but then I also have \num I I don't know like metad data about \nthe page like a say I'm I'm vectorizing \na the podcast clip and then I also have \nlike what number podcast it is who the \nspeaker is maybe how long the podcast is \nand then I can I can search with the \nembedding of just the content and then \npass in the symbolic data around the \nobject into then the language model and \nthen one other ID I see from llama index \nis this kind of recursive retrieval and \nI think you might find this quite \ninteresting this is where you would uh \nsearch through Wikipedia Pages like \nbased on their title and then whichever \none is the top match that one might have \na a table inside of it and so so like \nit's like a two-level query where first \nyou're searching through the titles of \nWikipedia pages that took me to \nbillionaires let's say and then within \nbillionaires there is a table that was \nlike you know age and exactly how much \nmoney they have and then you would do \nthe symbolic query within the linked uh \ntable super cool \ninteresting super cool uh so maybe \nwrapping up the podcast I I want to ask \nyou kind of like um you know this kind \nof like what's next question like what \nkind of future directions are really \nexciting \nyou yeah I think on that \num first I'm just so focused on \nfinishing this PhD and you know starting \nstarting uh starting up new things one \none particular direction that interested \nin is going from you know Insight \nretrieval from questions to generating \nquestions from tables so basically table \nto to question I would say um because \nnow um most like data teams let's say \nthey they rely on domain experts to form \nyou know formulate their qu their \nquestions fortunately we can now do that \nwith natural language and then translate \nthat to SQL so that already makes it \nmuch easier for domain experts to access \nrelevant data but one thing that I'm \ninterested in is see if we can somehow \nlearn what relevance questions are for a \ngiven table to ask so that we can kind \nof \nenrich um the \nexpertise um without needing the the \nquery let's say \nbecause you need yeah I think there's \njust I think there there is this kind of \nstat that says that we only use 1% of \nthe data that we have in in data \nwarehouses or maybe it's 5% I don't know \nspecifically U but we just use really \nlittle data and I think if we would be \nable to learn access patterns you know \nwhat kind of questions people ask on \ncertain tables I think we could then \nkind of try to move towards more \nrecommendation system \nfor insights saying for a given database \nlike hey we see that I don't know the \nnumber of of diseases for example in \nthis area has gone up and then I think \nthat could be really powerful so that's \nsomething that I'm I'm really eager on \nto move \ntowards I I love that I think that's so \ninspiring that kind of offline question \nDiscovery and especially with this \nperspective on tables and not just kind \nof like the long tail of documents \nthat's all just so amazing I I also \nreally inspired by that direction going \nforward of a more offline kind of \nprocessing of your data and and that \nkind of uh like self-directed research \nit's really amazing matalon thank you so \nmuch oh \nsorry yeah no yeah I'm I'm with you on \nthe excitement and I'm I'm just also \nvery excited to see you know startups \nnow ramp up in this space um more \nresearch you know it's just increasing \nin in embedding uh tables properly and \napplications of that and you know as we \ntouched on for example internal database \napplications for example query plan \nexecution optimization I think there's \nalso so much space to F to still explore \non the application side um so that's \nsomething that I'm very keen on as well \nbut yeah it's been really amazing to \ntalk to you um about this topic I'm \nreally \nexcited matalon thank you so much for \njoining the podcast I've learned so much \nfrom this conversation I'm sure our \nlisteners as well as well and \ncongratulations so much on the on the \nPHD it's super well deserved so many \namazing Publications and this whole \ntable representation learning it's just \nsuper interesting thanks so much Conor \nthanks for having me was
