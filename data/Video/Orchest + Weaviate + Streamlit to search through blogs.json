{"text": "A step-by-step guideline on how to do this yourself using Orchest, Weaviate, and Streamlit. \n[Music] \nhi everyone my name is rick and maybe \nyou've heard in the podcast about this \nexample that i would like to share it's \na pipeline that fetches data by scraping \ncomments off of a form on the internet \nthen inserts it into a vector database \ncalled weaviate which is open source \njust like orcist and it then allows you \nto query set database using a python \nbased streamlet application \nif none of these words mean anything to \nyou i'll go step by step to explain to \nyou what it's all about but basically \nit's about making content searchable in \na semantic way so semantic search \ndoesn't just do a one-to-one mapping of \ntext queries to text content but it \nactually tries to assign conceptual \nmeaning to such \ntwo paragraphs and words of text and it \nwill try to match your query \nwith the underlying meaning to find the \nrelevant content even if it's formulated \nin an entirely different way \nthan in the text query of your search \nand so what you're seeing on the screen \nis the orcis user interface this is a \npipeline developed in orchest and it's \nreally just simply two steps two \nnotebooks that get executed \nand it's really about fetching the data \nfrom a website and then \ninjecting that into a database so i'm \ngonna switch to jupyterlab to show you \nthe code it's actually quite short and \nsimple so this code is responsible for \nfetching the web page and that contains \nthe html that we're parsing that \ncontains the comments it also tries to \ncapture \nthe date stamp so we have a little bit \nof metadata about this comment and it \njust fetches it uh all of it and it \nreally \nuh \nstructures it in a very simple json-like \ndictionary that then gets passed to the \nnext step so this is like the only orcas \nrelated line of code in this entire \nnotebook that's how we pass data and \nmake it available to any step that gets \nconnected to it so in this pipeline you \ncan see that there's this this \nconnection \nand this connection basically \nallows you to \nget access to the data in the next step \nso in the next step this insert weaviate \nnotebook \nwe're basically able to get access to \nthose comments and use the built-in \npython client \nof we vv8 to be able to uh ingest like \nit's basically loading data into a \ndatabase and because they've written \nthey've written this really nice nice \npython client it's very easy to actually \nadd this data into bb8 you can see how \nsimple the code is it's just uh i don't \nknow 10 cells \nthat even do a little bit of stuff you \ndon't really need to do like printing \nthe client and it \njust deletes existing objects so we \nstart with uh from a clean slate fetches \nthe comments using this orches get \ninputs function uh from the previous \nstep in the pipeline and then injects it \ninto the the database and so if we um \ntake a look at the final piece of code \nthat's part of this project which is the \nstreamlet application \nit basically uses a connection to the \nwev8 database to allow you to then query \nusing this simple \nuh structure that is also part of their \npython sdk so it's like all python in \nthis project should be fairly simple to \nfollow source code and the end result is \nthat we can for a given user i've i've \nadded my own user id it fetches the the \ncomments injects it into eva and then \nmakes it available as a python \napplication so let me um \nshow you what it's like to use this \nstreamlet application you can enter a \nquery so i can search for uh like a hard \ndisk and it will actually find this \ncomment even though i talk about hdds \nwhich then we v8 knows \nis \nthis actual concept of a hard drive and \nand in fact we've eat supports multiple \nlanguages and so because this is a dutch \nwebsite i've created uh this example \nusing a dutch language model so having \nability to do semantic search in \nnon-native languages to english i think \nis really cool because it allows you to \nsearch content in all kinds of languages \nand so i can search for dutch words like \nhouse \nand it will actually talk about one of \nmy questions i asked about moving to to \na city and so i think this \nexample really shows you how you can use \norcas to piece together three \ninteresting concepts which is like web \nscraping of comments that are on the \npublic internet then injecting that into \na semantic search database like we v8 \nand then using a simple application like \nuh streamlet to be able to gener \ngenerate a simple ui \nthat allows you to actually uh take \nadvantage of \nthe content or the database that you've \ncreated so i would um \nrecommend everybody to check it out on \ngithub i'll link it below it contains \nthe full repository \nwith all of the information including \nthe readme and yeah i think \ni i hope this was an interesting example \nthat \nyou can use to get started with either \nwe v8 or orcist it has a open and orcis \nbutton in the repository that you can \nuse to spin up the example on orcas \ncloud we have this free tier that you \ncan use um so leave any comments if you \nhave questions we really like seeing \npeople engaged with the content we put \nout \nso \nyeah this this was it for my end and \nhope it was somewhat interesting \n[Music] \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Orchest + Weaviate + Streamlit to search through blogs", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzojafqsVA0",
