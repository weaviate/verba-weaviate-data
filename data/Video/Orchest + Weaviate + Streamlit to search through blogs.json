{"text": "A step-by-step guideline on how to do this yourself using Orchest, Weaviate, and Streamlit. \n[Music]hi everyone my name is rick and maybeyou've heard in the podcast about thisexample that i would like to share it'sa pipeline that fetches data by scrapingcomments off of a form on the internetthen inserts it into a vector databasecalled weaviate which is open sourcejust like orcist and it then allows youto query set database using a pythonbased streamlet applicationif none of these words mean anything toyou i'll go step by step to explain toyou what it's all about but basicallyit's about making content searchable ina semantic way so semantic searchdoesn't just do a one-to-one mapping oftext queries to text content but itactually tries to assign conceptualmeaning to suchtwo paragraphs and words of text and itwill try to match your querywith the underlying meaning to find therelevant content even if it's formulatedin an entirely different waythan in the text query of your searchand so what you're seeing on the screenis the orcis user interface this is apipeline developed in orchest and it'sreally just simply two steps twonotebooks that get executedand it's really about fetching the datafrom a website and theninjecting that into a database so i'mgonna switch to jupyterlab to show youthe code it's actually quite short andsimple so this code is responsible forfetching the web page and that containsthe html that we're parsing thatcontains the comments it also tries tocapturethe date stamp so we have a little bitof metadata about this comment and itjust fetches it uh all of it and itreallyuhstructures it in a very simple json-likedictionary that then gets passed to thenext step so this is like the only orcasrelated line of code in this entirenotebook that's how we pass data andmake it available to any step that getsconnected to it so in this pipeline youcan see that there's this thisconnectionand this connection basicallyallows you toget access to the data in the next stepso in the next step this insert weaviatenotebookwe're basically able to get access tothose comments and use the built-inpython clientof we vv8 to be able to uh ingest likeit's basically loading data into adatabase and because they've writtenthey've written this really nice nicepython client it's very easy to actuallyadd this data into bb8 you can see howsimple the code is it's just uh i don'tknow 10 cellsthat even do a little bit of stuff youdon't really need to do like printingthe client and itjust deletes existing objects so westart with uh from a clean slate fetchesthe comments using this orches getinputs function uh from the previousstep in the pipeline and then injects itinto the the database and so if we umtake a look at the final piece of codethat's part of this project which is thestreamlet applicationit basically uses a connection to thewev8 database to allow you to then queryusing this simpleuh structure that is also part of theirpython sdk so it's like all python inthis project should be fairly simple tofollow source code and the end result isthat we can for a given user i've i'veadded my own user id it fetches the thecomments injects it into eva and thenmakes it available as a pythonapplication so let me umshow you what it's like to use thisstreamlet application you can enter aquery so i can search for uh like a harddisk and it will actually find thiscomment even though i talk about hddswhich then we v8 knowsisthis actual concept of a hard drive andand in fact we've eat supports multiplelanguages and so because this is a dutchwebsite i've created uh this exampleusing a dutch language model so havingability to do semantic search innon-native languages to english i thinkis really cool because it allows you tosearch content in all kinds of languagesand so i can search for dutch words likehouseand it will actually talk about one ofmy questions i asked about moving to toa city and so i think thisexample really shows you how you can useorcas to piece together threeinteresting concepts which is like webscraping of comments that are on thepublic internet then injecting that intoa semantic search database like we v8and then using a simple application likeuh streamlet to be able to genergenerate a simple uithat allows you to actually uh takeadvantage ofthe content or the database that you'vecreated so i would umrecommend everybody to check it out ongithub i'll link it below it containsthe full repositorywith all of the information includingthe readme and yeah i thinki i hope this was an interesting examplethatyou can use to get started with eitherwe v8 or orcist it has a open and orcisbutton in the repository that you canuse to spin up the example on orcascloud we have this free tier that youcan use um so leave any comments if youhave questions we really like seeingpeople engaged with the content we putoutsoyeah this this was it for my end andhope it was somewhat interesting[Music]", "type": "Video", "name":
