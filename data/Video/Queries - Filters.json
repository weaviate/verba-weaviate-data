{"text": "Weaviate Academy Unit 2: Filters. \nhey and welcome back in this sectionwe'll introduce you to filters inwaviitefilters can help you to restrict yourvector searches to the parts of the dataset that you're interested infor example you might have a class thatcontains texts from multiple categoriesof booksin this case if you want to restrictyour vector search to a particularcategory such as historyyou can use a filter to do just thatit might be the same if you're lookingfor posts by a particular user or thosefrom a specific channel in a series ofposts in multiple channelsin other words filters can really helpyou to focus in with your vectorsearches to the parts of the data setthat you're interested insome of the most commonly used filtersinclude where limit and offsetthese filters can be applied to yourqueries to modify the results based onspecific criteria making them moretargeted and meaningfulthe web filter is similar to the whereclause in a SQL queryallowing it to apply a Boolean conditionthe datait can be used with different operatorssuch as like greater than less than andmany moreyou can even use multiple conditionswithin a wear filter to further refineyour query resultsthis can seem complex at first but ifyou think of them as simply combinationsof individual wear filters they'll seema lot more manageablenow let's discuss the limit and offsetfiltersyou've seen the limit filter already anumber of timesit restricts the maximum number ofobjects to be retrieved while the offsetfilter is used to skip a certain numberof resultsthese two filters are often usedtogether allowing you to paginate a longresult set to multiple sets of resultsfor example to display multiple pages of20 results per page you can set limit to20 and increase your offset by 20 at atime starting with zero so the firstpage would have an offset of zero thesecond page would have offset of 20 andso on and so forththis is a common technique that willhelp you to prevent having to fetch allproceeding results to create page Nationfilters are very powerful tools that canhelp you to refine your query results inwaviatethey allow you to combine theflexibility of vector searches with thePrecision of Boolean filters to onlyzero in uncertain parts of your data setthat you're interested inthat's it for this section on filters inwaviate thanks for watching and we'llsee you soon", "type": "Video", "name": "Queries - Filters", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ouOpwdbMQg", "timestamp": "", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
