{"text": "Weaviate Academy Unit 2: Filters. \nhey and welcome back in this section \nwe'll introduce you to filters in \nwaviite \nfilters can help you to restrict your \nvector searches to the parts of the data \nset that you're interested in \nfor example you might have a class that \ncontains texts from multiple categories \nof books \nin this case if you want to restrict \nyour vector search to a particular \ncategory such as history \nyou can use a filter to do just that \nit might be the same if you're looking \nfor posts by a particular user or those \nfrom a specific channel in a series of \nposts in multiple channels \nin other words filters can really help \nyou to focus in with your vector \nsearches to the parts of the data set \nthat you're interested in \nsome of the most commonly used filters \ninclude where limit and offset \nthese filters can be applied to your \nqueries to modify the results based on \nspecific criteria making them more \ntargeted and meaningful \nthe web filter is similar to the where \nclause in a SQL query \nallowing it to apply a Boolean condition \nthe data \nit can be used with different operators \nsuch as like greater than less than and \nmany more \nyou can even use multiple conditions \nwithin a wear filter to further refine \nyour query results \nthis can seem complex at first but if \nyou think of them as simply combinations \nof individual wear filters they'll seem \na lot more manageable \nnow let's discuss the limit and offset \nfilters \nyou've seen the limit filter already a \nnumber of times \nit restricts the maximum number of \nobjects to be retrieved while the offset \nfilter is used to skip a certain number \nof results \nthese two filters are often used \ntogether allowing you to paginate a long \nresult set to multiple sets of results \nfor example to display multiple pages of \n20 results per page you can set limit to \n20 and increase your offset by 20 at a \ntime starting with zero so the first \npage would have an offset of zero the \nsecond page would have offset of 20 and \nso on and so forth \nthis is a common technique that will \nhelp you to prevent having to fetch all \nproceeding results to create page Nation \nfilters are very powerful tools that can \nhelp you to refine your query results in \nwaviate \nthey allow you to combine the \nflexibility of vector searches with the \nPrecision of Boolean filters to only \nzero in uncertain parts of your data set \nthat you're interested in \nthat's it for this section on filters in \nwaviate thanks for watching and we'll \nsee you soon \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Queries -
