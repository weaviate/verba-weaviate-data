{"text": "This meetup by Etienne Dilocker is all about the horizontal scalability of the Weaviate vector search engine, a feature that became ... \nthanks okay then officially welcome to \ntoday's meetup that has the title \nhorizontal scaling uh which is yeah the \nthe 1.8 release that we released today \nwhere we released the release candidate \ntoday \nand really today is going to be \njust about deploying vv8 in a cluster in \na horizontally scaled fashion uh on a on \na kubernetes cluster and uh the last \nmeetup that we had was a lot of theory \nand i'm sorry the last meetup that i \nheld was a lot of theories sort of \naround all the the architecture \num that makes up vvate and today is sort \nof the counterpart to that like um \nwe have taken all of that architecture \nand we have put it into vba and now we \njust want to want to use it \nso today also marks uh the as i just \nsaid the the day that we released the \n1.8 uh release candidate which is i \nthink one of the biggest if not the \nbiggest um \npull request that we merged on bv8 so \nfar so 115 um commits there uh over \nthree months in the making \nuh yeah lots of lots of effort lots of \nof help from a lot of people very cool \nstuff in it and something that i'm also \nsuper proud of is we when we started our \narchitectural roadmap and i'll get to \nthat in a second uh one thing that we \nsaid is that we will release this by the \nend of q3 and today is september 30th \nand hey we actually made that and when \nthat when does that ever happen in \nsoftware development that you estimate a \ndate and um yeah and it actually works \nout \nso um let me quickly \nas i said today is going to be mostly \nsort of very practical but i want to \nvery quickly sort of recap which is \nsix slides or so a very quickly recap \nwhere we are on that roadmap so we \nstarted um the first thing was was just \nimproving the performance of our hnsw \nimplementation that we had way back in \nversion 1.4 \num and then we implemented the ls entry \nstorage which made importing a lot \nfaster because \nactually both of those releases made \nimporting a lot faster uh but 1.5 was \nsort of the point where we said like \nyeah um riding is no longer the \nbottleneck and and this is sort of the \nthe start to our scaling roadmap because \nwe said \nuh scaling horizontally \nonly makes sense if what we're scaling \nis already efficient because otherwise \nwell what what good is it running on \nfive nodes if you could get the same \nperformance out of a single note so \nthat's how we started this roadmap um \nsaying sort of yeah first we want to get \nthe max out of a single node and then we \nwant to scale \nhorizontally \nfor that uh \nwe had the sharded indices milestone \nwhich was completed sometime in august \nbut it wasn't actually released yet \nmostly because the added value of \ncharting your indices really only \nbecomes apparent when you have a natural \ncluster which is the current milestone \ntoday we released one 1.8 um or the \nrelease candidate for 1.8 \nwhich has horizontal scaling uh in in um \nin parentheses here without replication \nthat's the next step on the roadmap and \ni'll get to the the differences what \nthat means in a second \num \nyeah so so this roadmap is still ongoing \nbut today um we have the first release \nthat's horizontally scalable and \nreplication and dynamic scaling is \ncoming a bit later then \nso yeah uh that brings me to to talking \nquickly about uh sharding versus \nreplication and maybe the limitations \nthat we have here and that is also a \nperfect point to switch over to our docs \nwhich have also been updated for the \nrelease so i'm on the if you start out \nuh you end up on the the current release \ni'm on the the 1.8 release already which \nbecause it's just release candidate you \nget this it's wearing a warning here um \nyeah we've revamped this page and \nthere's a lot more i'm not going to go \ninto this into detail now but um there's \na nice new overview about the \narchitecture and we have a whole new \nsection about scaling \nand in here we have sort of the the two \nmajor motivations \nof um why you would want to scale your \nyour bb8 cluster um the first one and \nthis is sort of the one that i'm mostly \ngoing to be showing today \num is if you want to have a larger \ndata set size than a single node can fit \num the motivation is basically to chart \nyour data set onto multiple nodes and \nthen essentially if um \nyeah if onenote could only fit i don't \nknow so so today an article came out by \none of our community members who is \nrunning i think 60 million objects 60 \nmillion vectors on a single node so \nlet's for the sake of arguments say that \n60 million is the limit that one node \ncould handle then you could add two \nnodes and you could have 120 million and \nand so on so this is the the major \nmotivation um of sharding your data \nthe second motivation would be higher a \nquery throughput so if you have a single \nnode and let's say you can handle making \nthis up completely a thousand queries \nper second on that single note \nbut your traffic increases then the \nmotivation would be to scale to match \nthat um \nthat higher throughput and that is what \nwill be possible with replication so \nthis is something that's that's \nimportant to know \nas you chart your data set \nyou don't actually \ngain anything on the querying side but \nyou gain stuff on the importing side so \nso um you have more resources to import \nso that gets faster but not on query \nwith replication that's going to be the \nother way around \nand then the the third one which is also \na benefit of replication is high \navailability so if you have your data \nset running on um yeah let's say \nreplicated on three nodes \nif one of those nodes nodes fail \nthen you can still um \nyeah use the cluster normally the only \nlimitation is going to be that \nthroughput is slightly \nlower \nbut then you could scale sort of for a \nhigh availability and we also have a \nsummary of that \nover here in that section where you can \nsay advantages when increasing sharding \nyou can run larger data sets and you can \nspeed up your imports \nthe disadvantage is that even as you add \nmore resources to your cluster you don't \nactually improve the query side \nand then the other way around for \nfor replication the system becomes \nhighly available and you can scale your \nquery side linearly where the \ndisadvantage is that even though you add \nmore resources to your cluster the \nimport actually doesn't speed up because \nnow it has to be imported or replicated \nonto \nmultiple nodes so this is the the sort \nof intro to that there's a lot more \nthings that we can get into but yeah i \nwouldn't tackle those as part of the \nlive demo \nwhich yeah which will dive right in \nbasically \num so for the first part let's let's see \ni have prepared a kubernetes cluster \num and in there i've created a namespace \nand this namespace is currently \ncompletely empty so if i look at all the \nresources in that first connect always \ntake some time let's see if the cluster \nis still reachable that would be nice \nthat really took long i think subsequent \nqueries should be much faster um yes so \ni have a kubernetes cluster and this \nnamespace is completely empty and now i \nwant to deploy bb8 into that namespace \nfor this we have a new release of our \nhelm chart which let me also show you \nthat \nthere we go \nhelm is the the german word for helmet \nso i always get like these helmet things \nhere but i actually want the helm chart \nuh which has releases so there we go we \nhave let's also release candidate \nbecause it points to the vivian release \ncanada \num for 14 which works with horizontal \nscalability so i've already downloaded \nthat so you can see here i have this \nthis v8 pgc which is just the latest \nhome chart and i have a very very simple \nvalue cml file um which is basically \nmeant to to deploy this so i'm \noverriding a few things i'm overwriting \nwell actually i don't even need to \noverride this anymore because that's now \npart of the release that i had to during \ndevelopment and i have replicas and i \nactually want to start with a single \nreplica \nand then right here this is just some \nsome firewall configuration so i'm \nbasically whitelisting my own ip address \nin the firewall \nand uh yeah we're starting with a single \nreplica and this this is tiny this is \nnot a size that makes a lot of sense in \nin real life probably with just two cpus \non a single node but for now for demo \npurposes that's absolutely absolutely \nperfect so this is my values yaml and i \nhave a deploy script it's almost almost \ndoesn't make sense to call it the script \nbecause it's very simple we're basically \njust running this item potent uh command \nto upgrade in my namespace \nwith that value cmo um yeah so sorry \nthat's a release name and down here is \nthe the namespace \nso let me simply run this \nand we should deploy a vba cluster that \ncurrently has a single node so ignore \nthose warnings i'm running with the the \ngke autopilot cluster so basically as i \ndeploy more stuff on that cluster it \nautomatically provisions uh new \ninfrastructure in the background which \nis kind of cool actually so if we look \nat \nthe parts so it's okay it's just maybe \nthis for for cube ctl maybe easier to \nunderstand if they actually type those \nout uh so we have currently a single um \nv8 note right here which is currently \nbeing provisioned as you can see \ncontainer creating so this is mostly \njust the kubernetes cluster which has to \nto download uh the image \nand maybe just watch this \nwhen it's actually it's actually running \nalready so that's cool so just to to \nprove that this works we can look at \nthe service definition and here we see a \nservice that has an external ip \ntake a look at that and now if i contact \nthis \nthere we go so this v8 instance is \nrunning and right now it has a single \nnode which is not the point of this \nmeetup so let's take our values yaml and \nas with any configuration that you \nchange in um your values yaml that will \nbe applied once you deploy it again so \nlet's say we go for three replicas for \nexample so let's do that and i'm just \nrunning my deploy script \ntakes a second \nclean that up and now again if we watch \ncube cpl get pods you will see that they \nare being created in a stateful set in \nan sort of ordinal fashion so we're \nstarting with the vba 0 and then we're \ncurrently creating instance bb81 \nand once that is done and ready then it \nwill create bb83 so let's just wait for \nthat for a second \nsomething to note while these are um so \nyou can see the one is pending right now \nthat's that means that the cluster needs \nto provision the infrastructure was very \nfast uh one thing to note \nabout um dynamic scaling so as we said \non the roadmap dynamic scaling is \nactually not yet not yet present so let \nme go to the \nroadmap \nyeah dynamic scaling is actually the \nlast point on the roadmap so \nsome things of dynamic scaling so as \nyou're seeing right now i'm actually \nadding notes when the cluster is already \nthere that already works but there are \nsome limitations basically as rule of \nthumb if there's no data in the cluster \nyet you can do whatever you want if \nthere is data in the cluster and you \nincrease its size that works however if \nyou um there's basically no way yet \nto to drain a node or to tell a node \nthat is being decommissioned and that \nwhatever load is on the node should be \nmoved to a different node so that is \nsomething that will come in the \ndynamic scaling milestone so basically \nif you have data imported on a three \nnode cluster and you reduce it to two \nnodes that that will break at the moment \nbecause that's yeah not not the dynamic \nscaling part yet um but coming back to \nto um our cluster which is now ready so \nthat was basically all we had to do and \nwe see all of this is ready and of \ncourse you don't have to worry about \nsomething like such as load balancing \nbecause it's running on kubernetes so \nthe service that we have in front of it \nwill already \nload balance \nacross those three uh deviate notes \nthere their pods in kubernetes speak in \nin v8 speak their their notes because \nthey're not tied to two kubernetes that \njust makes it much easier \nso if we get that service again \nhere it has that external ip \nand that basically has the load balancer \nin front of it so if we contact it again \nwell \nthere's nothing in it yet so if we look \nat for example the schema \nyou can see right now it's empty so \nlet's import something into that let's \nget started with we have the \nnews publication data set this very \nsimple data set um we run that also in \nour documentation with slightly \ndifferent configuration but that doesn't \nmatter but we can just use that and we \ncan just import it so let me just \nquickly import that that is python 3 \nimport \nthat point then i always need to check \nwhat the order is deviate url first \nthat one \ncache here it's cache english and batch \nsize i don't know let's go for something \nlike 128. \nokay so that is running that is \nimporting okay now i need a \ndifferent uh terminal tab here \num so now what we can do let's i want to \nshow something um let's quickly look at \nthese email that we have yeah schema is \nthere cool and i know that one of the \nclasses in that schema is called article \nso let me take a look at this one \nwe maximize this so here you see a \ndifferent difference to previous vba \nversions first of all we have this whole \nsharding config thing that didn't exist \nbefore but more importantly \ni didn't change anything about my import \nscript this is exactly the same import \nscript that we have been running um on \nyeah on regular pv8 instances but you \ncan see that it said the desired count \nand also the actual count for shards to \nthree \nso the desired and actual count at the \nmoment is always the same because um \nyeah charts are basically \nor the creation of shards is basically \natomic at the moment \nin the future this is going to be an \nasync process with regards to to \nreplication for example so let's say you \nhave a replication factor of one and \nthen you set you increase this to three \nreplicas then data has to be replicated \nfrom those \none node to the the other nodes so that \nthat is basically when that process \nbecomes asynchronous right now it's \nsynchronous so desired and actual is the \nsame \nhowever what i wanted to say is \nbasically um that yeah it automatically \nadjusted the amount of shards \nto my cluster size and in the second \ndemo that i'll show later we can also \nsee that it doesn't have to be that way \nyou can also control this if you don't \nwant to set it to that size okay ideally \ni've been talking enough for this to \nfinish yeah that's cool so um let's take \nthat url \nand let's maybe just connect to that \ncluster and for this we can take the vv8 \nconsole \nyep that downgrades because it's not an \nhttps connection \nokay still the same url \ncool so that should be i probably have \nit in my history somewhere but let's \nmaybe just start from from scratch \nso let's just send a query any kind of \nquery as you're used to sending to vva \nso let's go for \narticle and then we can \ngo for a title and summary maybe \nand then to make it interesting let's \nset it \nlimit and let's set a near text so that \nbasically means this is going to be a \nvector search because i'm running with \nthe contextionary you can of course also \nrun with transformers for simplicity \nsake so we don't need gpus in this demo \ni've just picked the contextionary which \nworks fine \nand i've asked bob before for an example \nuh that because he uses this data set a \nlot and he said housing prices is one \nthat \nthat he typically uses so let's go for a \nvector search of housing prices uh the \ncontent itself \ndoesn't actually matter just to to sort \nof as a proof of concept it does find \nstuff relating to to house it housing \nprices and uh \nhousing shortages etc so the vector \nsearch is working uh the part that i \nwant to show is basically if i run it \nagain it's still working and the the \ninteresting part here is because we're \nrunning with three nodes in that cluster \nand we have a load balancer in front of \nit we cannot predict which node is hit \non that search but if i run it again and \nagain and again and again it will always \nreturn the same results so basically no \nmatter which chart we hit whether that \nchart has all the data or parts of the \ndata deviate internally makes \nsure that it contacts all the other \ncharts that um \nyeah that have data or um that it needs \ndata from and this is also why we said \nbefore in the limitations of sharding \nthat the queries per second actually \ndon't go up if you increase the the \namount of chart even even if for each \nnew chart you add a new physical node \nthat has new hardware um \nbecause your data set is now spread onto \ndifferent nodes \nwe don't know which node contains your \ndata um and and \nin this simple case and this is maybe \nalso a good point to to talk about this \nthere are a few more other fields that \nwe see here \nso right now we are sharding on the key \nid which is the with the underscore this \nis the internal or not the internal id \nbut the the id um \nthe the uuid that every um object in vv8 \nhas \nand we're currently \nhaving a strategy which means hash so \nessentially we're creating a hash from \nthe id \nand there's just a specific hash \nfunction in this case it's a murmur 3 \nand i think it's a 64-bit hash \nthe \ninteresting part about this is so so \nright now this is fixed and this is \nactually immutable but in the future and \nthis is why it's in the country the plan \nis to um open that up \nand so that you could for example uh set \nthis to a different field um \nso um sorry \nif for example you have a specific \nproperty in your data and you know that \nyou usually set a where filter on a \nspecific property you could set that \nhere and then you could already chart \naccording to that and then you could be \nin situations where basically a single \nchart can answer your uh query \nand then you do actually benefit from \nfrom sharding as well with regards to \nthe throughput in this case right now \nbecause the ids are basically \nmeaningless from the perspective of \nsuch a search \nright now i just have to hit all three \nshards and basically combine the results \num \nokay that speaking of combining results \nthat's basically the perfect segue into \nan aggregation \nso let me \naggregate an article again and let's \nmaybe start with \njust a count yeah account count is also \naccount isn't actually that interesting \nfor what i wanted to show let me just \nquickly get this what i wanted is i \nthink there's a property \nconvert count \nyeah which is just an inf so this is not \nvva counting anything that is just a \nproperty in that data set where each \narticle has the specific word concept \nand here let's say we go for i don't \nknow a maximum and a minimum \num \nso if we run that so first of all if i \nrun it again same result that's \nimportant because we never know which \nwhich node is being um \nwhich node is serving that query \nbasically \num \nyeah so so if we have something like a \nmaximum or a minimum that is easy to \naggregate like one chart will say my \nhighest number is i don't know 15 000 \none chart will say my highest number is \nuh 100 and the next one will say my \nhighest number is 1680 \n16852 this is easy to aggregate for \nmaximum we just pick the highest for \nminimum we pick the lowest et cetera \nif we go for something like a mean the \nvalue becomes being an approximate value \nso what we're doing in the case of a \nmean for example is we simply take the \nmean of each chart's result which would \nbe the real mean if um data was \nperfectly evenly sharded but in real \nlife it's never going to be perfectly \neven so this is something you have to \nkeep in mind if you're working on a \nsharded data set the mean is going to be \nan approximate volume \nbut \nyeah the important thing is no matter \nwhich note you hit you're always going \nto get the real results \nso let's come back \nhere this was the first demo \nwhich was cool but also only a tiny tiny \ndata set so \nas we saw with it \nno aggregate \narticle \nmeta \ncount \nyou can see this is really just just a \n3500 data points in this data set so i \nalso want to demo a second case with a \nlarger data set and especially on this \none i want to show you that \nas you add more shards and therefore add \nmore resources to your cluster \num you also increase the import speed \nso for this let me just switch my \nkubernetes context to a second namespace \nwhich i already prepared and here i've \nalready actually deployed vba \nand in this case if we take a look \nthree attempts \nif we look at this specific namespace we \ncan see that we actually have 12 v8 \nnodes running so they're still \nrelatively small but there's 12 nodes \njust to show that yeah you can \nscale them as you wish there's also an \nimporter job which was still running \nfrom my test before let me quickly \ndelete this \nrate it again \nso in this \nin this cluster um i also have so the \nsame thing applies here i don't have a \nservice here \nthis has a different ip \nso just to show before we start \nnot localhost i'm so used to typing \nlocalhost \num if we look at the schema \nthis instance is currently empty so if \nit has no schema it also can't have any \ndata because data is held in in classes \nso to show \nan import on a larger cluster i have \nprepared a very simple import job which \nruns a script so let me go for this \nimport outstanding that is the wrong one \nthat is \nfolder let me go for \nlet me go for this kubernetes job just \nthe kubernetes job if you're if you're \nnew to kubernetes a job is basically \njust a pod that just runs once or if \nit's a cron job and it runs like a crown \njob but basically um it's not like \nonce it finishes kubernetes doesn't make \nsure to restart it which is um \nyeah i'll post to the deployment or \nstateful set where if it goes down \nkubernetes should make sure that it goes \nback up again \nthis script basically just randomly \ngenerates vectors or objects that have a \na vector attached to them which is \nrandom and i can just configure it i can \nask it to have this many dimensions this \nis just where it should \nset to send it to total size which is \ncurrently set to a hundred thousand \npatch size set to one thousand \nand charts which i'm going to set to one \nfor the first example so even though i \nhave so this is i said this before um \nthat uh \nthe the shards are picked to the size of \nthe cluster unless you explicitly \nconfigure them so even though i have a \n12 node cluster right now i'm explicitly \ntelling this class should only uh be \nchart or \nshould only have a single chart which \nmeans it can only live on a single note \nand i'm doing this on purpose so then we \nhave a baseline comparison basically so \nlet me cube ctl \napply minus f import job that creates \nthe job and now if we look at our \npods \nand we can see oh it's already running \nthat means it was scheduled on a note \nthat already had the the image locally \nthat's nice \nso then we can just attach to the logs \nwhich is uh let me type it out cube ctl \nlocks minus f and the name of that thing \nand then we can see it's currently \nimporting it's not super fast because of \ncourse these these nodes are sized uh \nvery small it only has i think in this \ncase four cpu so two more than in my \nprevious example \nand as you can see basically as with any \ndata set in the beginning the the \nbatches are basically artificially fast \nbecause there's no not much data \nimported yet um but as this imports i \nthink this will \nsort of \neventually \ngo to around five seconds or something \nper per batch and then it will stay \nrelatively constant at that rate \num i'm not going to keep it running all \nthe time \num because i think this job in total i \nthink it would take about i don't know \nthis thing about six to seven minutes or \nso to complete \num but what i want to do is connect to \nthat bb8 instance and just show you that \nstuff is happening just to sort of show \nthat it's um \nyeah \nnot just printing random stuff but \nactually importing something so let's \nlog out here \nlet's log out into a login into this one \nand then let's run a simple aggregate \nquery \ncall the demo class yeah let's just \ncount it \nand there we go we currently have thirty \nnine thousand \nand forty thousand now so batch size was \none thousand so that makes sense and if \nwe look at our \nlogs again \nthey should now be at yeah forty percent \nso i think yeah the first one starts at \nzero percent so the highest would be 99 \nso that that matches perfectly \nand yeah as i said sort of as these uh \nbatches will average around five seconds \neventually i think it will take six to \nseven minutes maybe maybe eight minutes \nor so to complete um but i'm actually \ngoing to stop it because \nsomething lead oh it's very delete the \njob \nlet's delete it \nokay and now let's modify that same job \nand as i said \nall we have to do and this is i think \nalso something that's that's really cool \nall that we have to do to make use of \nthat cluster is just change the \nconfiguration in the in the class \nand \noh by the way i haven't shown sort of \nwhere this is in the class um yet on \nthis one i'll show you um when this is \nrunning right now so for now let's maybe \ngo for for a chart i'm not going to go \nfor the full 12 yet just for for eight \nfor now \num and then let's apply that job again \nand other job by the way um first \ni need to delete the job \nuh no i think it already did yeah all \nright good so i can apply it the job \nitself will delete every v8 class \num so it always starts \nbasically \nso if we look at the pods it's already \nrunning again that's nice \nso let's attach to it \nand now you can see this is way faster \nalready so we're now talking about batch \ntimes they're taking yeah i don't know \n300 milliseconds or something because \nwe're now using a cluster of eight nodes \nwhere previously we were only using a \nsingle note so also let me go here again \nand show you and look we've already \nsurpassed the the other one \nso yeah this one i think we can actually \nlet that finish because it's going to \ngoing to be finished very \nso let's wait for yeah another i don't \nknow 20 seconds or so \nso funny thing \nas i um sort of tried this out and this \nis also the explanation for why i went \nfor eight shards right now not for the \nfull 12. \num \nas i tried this out yesterday \nwe found out that these batches are \nstarting to become so large that the \nbottleneck right now is actually not \ndeviated itself but we've had clients so \nwe tested with this is running with the \ngo client because it's a bit more \nefficient than the python client \nbut we're seeing right now that \nbasically in the batch where you send \nthe entire data which in this case is a \n300 dimensional vectors so that's quite \na lot of data that's being sent there \nand you get the response in the response \nyou get the same data back \nbecause um well it's just sort of the \nthe idea of creating an object then you \nget the same object back because some \nfields might have been \nfilled by by vv8 for example \nand this is currently entirely done in \njson and yesterday i uh checked \nthe size of i think a batch of ten \nthousand that is just running a thousand \nand for ten thousand objects the batch \nwas actually 27 megabytes and turns out \nat 27 megabytes just sending the batch \nover http and sort of parsing the json \nis actually quite slow so this is \nbecoming the bottleneck \nand this is basically um yeah sort of \npreventing the times from going down \nlinearly so if we run this same job \nagain so let's \ndelete \nimporter \nand run it again \nthis time \nwith the full 12 shards so in \nideally sort of from a vva perspective \nnow we're adding 50 more resources so \nthis should in theory uh speed it up uh \neven faster but it doesn't actually \nbecause the bottom line right now is the \nthe client so um that's why i picked \nthese these steps of sort of one eight \nand no twelve because between one and \neight it's it's still more or less \nlinear but as we sort of add more power \nto this cluster \nyeah the client becomes the bottleneck \nso let's \nkeep cal applying my job again \nand let's take a look at it okay this \ntime it landed on a note that didn't \nhave the the image locally yet it seems \nso it actually has to \nactually downloading uh but now it's on \nand running that's good \nso if we attach \nto the logs of that one again \nand you can see it is a bit faster um \nbut yeah it's definitely not 50 faster \nso right now there is um yeah sort of a \nsaturation in this \nexample which is in no way \nrepresentative but just for for for this \nparticular um \ncase \num sort of around uh eight no eight \nnotes in this case um so let's see i \nthink the total time on the other one \nwas 52 and yeah this is barely any \nfaster \nthis is \n48 so adding 50 more resources in this \ncase didn't actually pay off \nbut as said this is something that's \ncurrently the limit is in the client so \nwe measured the time of sort of from \nvba's perspective how much work it has \nto do as opposed to the clients and \nwe're seeing that the clients are the \nbiggest overhead which is something we \ncan easily fix \nvarious ways compression \nmaybe a binary protocol on the request \num what would probably also help is just \nto make the the response maybe a bit \nmore efficient that the vector would \nonly be sent to the flag is set or \nsomething like this um but yeah the cool \ncase is the vv8 cluster itself it's \nstill \nyeah it still works very nicely even \nwith 12 notes one other thing that i \nwanted to show on this particular one \nbefore we wrap up um i set the um yeah \nthe sharding configuration in my script \ni wanted to show the effect that i \nactually had and \nlet me quickly do i still have the ip \nhere no to get that again \nservice \nml class \nhere you can see um that because i said \nthat the charts to 12 minutes here they \nended up at 12 \nand if we were to \nchange that again to a different value \nlet's just go look for the \njob and let's maybe \nthat back to one \nand apply it again \nand now we need to wait for it to \nactually run \nit's already running that's cool so now \nwe can \nlook at the classic and and now we can \nsee \nthat it's just one so that was basically \nthe change that i was doing a point \nbeing that \njust in your configuration in your \nschema configuration that you're already \nsending you now basically have control \nover how that class should be spread um \namongst your your vivian notes \nyeah that wraps up the second live demo \nand \nas you can see here \ni'm still importing now on a single uh \nnote \nmuch slower now than it was on the on \nthe cluster um yeah before we move to \ntwo questions because we have still have \na bit of time i just want to very \nquickly walk you through it through the \nnew documentation because well it's \nactually not new documentation it's just \na few new pages in the architecture \nsection \num but yeah as we said we have the \nroadmap which i talked about in the \nbeginning already \nand horizontal scalability is now \nreleased \nnext up is replication which i think the \nbenefits we outlined before \nalso if we go to the overview \nwe have this this graphic here which i \nthink is also really nicely shows how oh \nwow that's \nthere we go um \nshows sort of how everything ties \ntogether in vb8 especially with regards \nto modules \num \nalso \nyeah from a scaling perspective so if \nyou were to run a module that needs gpus \nfor example \nthat module runs in its own container so \nyou could run that on separate hardware \nwhich is gpu accelerated or the vb8 core \nwhich is now horizontally scalable \nas the stateful part is completely cpu \nonly \nspeaking of cpu let me zoom in a bit \nagain \nof cpus and resources we also added a \nguide on um \nsort of how to \nhow to \nsize your cluster or how to size your \nnodes that's that's the same thing so a \nquestion that that i received today was \nif i'm running vva in a cluster um how \ndoes that change my my um yes or i think \nit was specific to memory but in general \nmy resource requirements and the answer \nis it really shouldn't so basically if \nyou're running with 24 cpus before and \nnow you say i want to run on three nodes \nthen you should be able to run three \nnodes of the eight cpus each and the \nsame is true for for memory uh but in \ngeneral we have this new section in the \ndocumentation um \nyeah sort of outlining the role of cpus \nwhat do they do why would you add more \ncpus same for from memory \num also something about \nyeah potential bottlenecks \nhow garbage collection in go would \naffect your bb8 \nthing what you can do to potentially \nreduce memory requirements if it's too \nhigh \nuh caching vectors on disk \nthe role of gpus etc so this is really \ncool new guide that should definitely \nhelp you and of course the one on \nhorizontal scalability with everything \nthat we talked about right now \num what other points didn't we oh yeah \nthere are two two more points that i \ndidn't actually three more points that i \ndidn't talk about at all \num one is re-sharding so resharting is \nalso something that um we put in the \ndynamic scaling milestone so it means \nright now the shard count is immutable \nyou cannot change it \num the reason for this is \nbasically \nnot actually the reason for it mostly \nthat it's going to be in a later \nmilestone \nbut still there is something that you \nneed to to keep in mind with regards to \nrecharging um this h and sw index that \nwe built up you can't just cut that in \nhot half or cut that into individual \nparts so basically a resharing process \nis \nbasically a new import so what that \nmeans is \nsort of in the worst case this is not \nhow it is in vv8 but this is how it \ncould be let's say \nyou're going from one chart to two \nshards and you would have to sort of \nbuild up everything again that would \nessentially just mean \nyou need to re-import your entire data \nwhat we have in vv8 is a virtual chart \nsystem which is very much inspired by we \nwe talked about this in depth in the um \nin the architecture meetup where we went \nthrough all the theory which is inspired \nby cassandra's \nvirtual notes and the idea here is that \nbasically \nwe assign \ndata or we assign yeah \nobjects basically to a virtual chart \nwhich then belongs to a physical chart \nand if we change the number of physical \ncharts \nonly \nthose virtual shards or only some \nvirtual shards basically have to be \nmoved so this means that if you go for \nexample from four shards to five shards \nyou don't wanna have any movement \nbetween the four existing shards the \nonly movement you wanna have is from \nthose four charts to the new chart so \nthis is this example here um that if you \nhave so here we have if it takes as an \nexample if it took you 60 minutes to \nimport your data into four shards and \nnow you're adding a fifth chart um then \neach chart will have to transfer 20 of \nits data which means that the resharding \nprocess would take roughly 20 of the \nimport time which would be uh 12 minutes \nin this case \nso \nimportant to keep in mind resharding it \nis on the roadmap for dynamic scaling \num or is it actually i think here it \nsays it's it's sort of it's on the \nroadmap but not even in that point it's \njust something that that we can do in \nthe future but there is a cost to \nrecharging because of the h is w index \nuh next point that i did not talk about \nyet and i also won't talk about right \nnow for more than a sentence or two \num how do notes discover each other \nuh basically you can see that \nin \nwhen i showed the services here \nthere is a vvate headless service which \nis part of the new um \nof the new uh \nhelm chart that we deployed or that we \nreleased today \nand basically what that does is it just \nresolves the ips of the individual nodes \nand then the nodes themselves uh \nyeah they use that information to \ncommunicate \nand as long as as any node in the \ncluster has contact with any existing \nnodes they will discover each other \nbecause they are using a gossip protocol \nor gossip-like protocol and this is not \nsomething we invented um and also not \nsomething we implemented but something \nwe just are using a hashicorp's member \nlist go library for this and and this is \nalso that this gossip protocol also \nwould communicate stuff like a failure \nscenario for example so if one node is \num assumed dead then basically that news \nwill spread like like gossip \num \nyes this is all \nthe important thing to say about this is \nbasically that you don't have to do \nanything as long as you use the the vba \nhelm chart so as you could saw as you \ncould see with the um \nthe first example where we started from \nscratch having nothing but a kubernetes \ncluster all you have to do is configure \nthe replicas and it will be deployed \nuh next thing is also something that we \ndon't have in right now but that um yeah \nmight make sense in the future which is \nsomething such as node affinity so as i \nsaid before i could tell vva to only \ncreate one chart or eight charts and \nthese one or eight charts were \nbasically distributed among those 12 \nnodes physical nodes kubernetes parts \nthat we had \nbut we can't currently control which \nnodes should get something so this is \nsomething that we might add in future \nlike a label or rule for example so \nlet's say if you had \nasync node sizes um some nodes bigger \nthan others then you might want to \nsort of put more charts on one node or \nmaybe you have more critical nodes or \nsomething like that so in the future we \nmight add labels here and if you're if \nyou've used kubernetes before i think \nthe term node affinity is also one that \nthey use \nso that's definitely um inspired by \nkubernetes and meant to to work with \nkubernetes \nyeah other than that we've talked about \nthe stuff that isn't implemented yet \nwhich is basically what is on the \nroadmap so replication will be part of \nthe next release probably will have \nanother meetup where you can show that \nsomething that i'm already looking \nforward to to show \nis um yeah actually putting query load \non the cluster and getting it to a point \nwhere um it's maxed out and then just \nadding new notes and um \nyeah \nand increasing the query uh load or the \nquery capability once we have \nreplication so that is currently under \ndevelopment well it is going to be after \ntoday because today we finished um the \nhorizontal scaling without replication \nmilestone \nwhich is ready to use as you can see 1.8 \ni think it's currently not yet in the \nconfigurator let me check actually i \ndon't have to check i know that we \nhaven't put it in yet but um let me \nnevertheless demonstrate yeah it's not \nhere yet but we'll add it tomorrow \nprobably \nas a as a release candidate \nyeah that wraps up the live demo those \nactually wanted to to go to this one \nthat wraps up the live demo \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Meetup \u2013 Horizontal Scaling, Sharding, Kubernetes,
