{"text": "Hey everyone! Here is a clip from our newest Weaviate podcast with Farshad Farahbakhshian, Gen AI specialist at AWS and ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for watching we've yet on YouTube we have a super exciting new podcast announcing weeviate on the AWS Marketplace to kick things off I think this is a really informative clip from Eddie and delocker CTO and co-founder of weeviate explaining how hybrid SAS works we started off with this conversation topic around different uses of multi-tenancy from separating different Cloud instances from each other to users within a weeviate instance so with that said let's dive into it here's edian on hybrid SAS yeah so with tenancy because I talked about multi-tenancy before but in a very different context so it's kind of a a difficult term because before multi-tenancy referred to our users having multiple users in this case now tenancy refers to assert the isolation boundaries within AWS so um so so let's say our chat bot application from before is an AWS customer they don't want their data to be mixed up with competing chatbot application but still within sort of this single tenancy setup they might have multiple users so it's an a term used in multiple settings nevertheless the concepts are exactly the same for us so data that shouldn't leave a certain realm and this is this is something where um the the sort of again those using the same term the single tendency nature of your own bv-8 deployment in your private VPC in your Cloud tenant um that that gives you the capability to stay completely in control so um touch upon this at the very beginning um if you want just something fast up and running just use her VBA cloud service or you bv8 cloud service in in that definition of tenancy is multi-tenant so that means other customers that use the VBA cloud service run in the same AWS project for example on our cloud service if you have these requirements for for strict isolation you can run it in your own um yeah we say in your own VPC and the VPC is in your Cloud tenant so it's basically whatever kind of boundaries you you want to Define and you can do this this is something that we're we're launching right now as we're recording this it's not public yet maybe it will be when we're uh depends on depends on how long it takes to edit this or if we're just about to launch on the VV uh on the AWS Marketplace we're launching DV8 on the AWS Marketplace um and it's a one-click deployment kind of setup where we can do exactly that so if you have an existing VPC you can deploy into that VPC if you're starting from scratch you can create a new VPC and this is the the kind of setting where you can make sure that because your data that's contained in vv8 is then wherever E8 is deployed so exactly the same concept it can never be accessed by anyone else it can never be mixed up with someone else no one else has access you are completely in control if you tomorrow you decide you want to tear it down you want to delete the disks you are in in that kind of kind of control which is great for for all kinds of yeah security compliance Etc settings uh the the downside basically is that it's it's potentially a bit more operations effort because now you're running vb8 and this is where our hybrid SAS idea comes in so with hybrid SAS basically the vva team helps you run this so depending on how much data data you're willing to give away for example one thing that you could opt into is saying like hey I want to push my metrics to the vva team then what we can do is monitor the metrics so you can say like hey you're about to run out of XYZ or we see a pattern here there or maybe if something happens um then then and you're reaching out for for support to us and we can say like okay we we have the kind of Diagnostics uh tools that we need or another option is like even if you can't even share metrics then we can also in the in the sort of uh least common denominator would be we can jump on a zoom call and maybe there's maybe a sort of figure out what's going on together so you get like various levels of of support contracts and support uh settings in that that kind of hybrid SAS setting where um yeah the the sort of underlying thing is you own your data and we help you with the operations part as much as you want ", "type": "Video", "name": "hybrid_saas_in_weaviate_explained", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWzii5HhCHM", "timestamp": "", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
