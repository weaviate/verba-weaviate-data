{"text": "Weaviate Academy Unit 3: Index. \nhey and welcome back to waviate Academy in this unit we'll guide you through the exciting process of populating waviate with data yourself you'll learn about how to define data structure and import data into your webiate instance this is a major milestone in not only using weeviate but understanding webiate's overall data architecture after you're done with this unit you'll be ready to populate your own Vector database with waviate which will transform the way you interact with your data so let's get started before diving into the specifics check out the prerequisites for this unit below as always we've listed any requirements as well as Preparatory work and we also highly recommend that you complete the previous webiate Academy units if you haven't done so already in this unit we'll Begin by looking at various components in waviate that's used to store data that means indexes and classes as well as the schema learning about schemas is really important because this is where you drop a blueprint or a structure for how your instance of webiate is going to store and retrieve data defining a schema that'll work for your data is a key step in being able to retrieve the right data objects in a way that suits you so we'll use this unit to start building that understanding of what indexes are what a class and its properties represent and how to configure them all through the schema and then we'll put this blueprint into practice by importing data so you'll also learn about how to import data in waviate and some best practices along the way as well like batch Imports and how to avoid duplicate objects by the end of this unit you'll be fetching a real data set and populating a real waviate instance which is very exciting so in summary here's what you'll learn in this unit you learn about data architecture where you'll gain a high level understanding of the key components that allow waviate to effectively store and retrieve data you learn about schemas here you'll learn about different components of a schema and how they relate to your data empowering it to build a wave 8 instance that works for you and you'll learn about Imports where you'll see how data is imported into Eva including best practices and tips by the end of this unit you'll have a quiet invaluable knowledge about wavya's data architecture and you'll have built a wavy8 instance with real data that's enough for me now let's get started ", "type": "Video", "name": "Schemas Import - Index", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEXawqO7s_A", "timestamp": "", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
