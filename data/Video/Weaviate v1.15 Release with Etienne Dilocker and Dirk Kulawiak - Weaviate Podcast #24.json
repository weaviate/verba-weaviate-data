{"text": "Weaviate v1.15 Release! Thank you so much for checking out the Weaviate podcast -- here is a summary of what is new in ... \nthank you \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nchecking out a new weviate release \npodcast releasing webiate version 1.15 \nthis release is shot with all sorts of \nexciting new things from cloud native \nbackups improved stability for high \nmemory setups faster Imports for ordered \nobjects more efficient filter \naggregations two new distance metrics \ntwo new Eva modules and then smaller \nimprovements and Bug fixes so it's a \nlong list of exciting new things to me I \nthink it's so interesting seeing these \nConcepts in computer science like red \nblack trees and how do they impact \ndatabase systems how has it been added \nto alleviate and all these other \nexciting things Eddie's written this \nawesome article on the go mem limit and \nhow that's improving the stability for \nhigh memory setups and then this Cloud \nnative backups so Eddie and thank you so \nmuch for coming on the web podcast to \ndiscuss uh version 1.15 hey Connor \nthanks for having me yeah it's a super \nexciting release \num so many cool new features when we \ninitially set out to to build this 1.15 \nrelease uh the the main plan basically \nwas around backups but now we have this \nlong list the features and I think every \nsingle one of them is a great reason to \nto upgrade but yeah let's maybe start \nwith backups uh there the the kind of \nPoint yeah everyone needs backups right \nI mean it's kind of a requirement to run \nyour your database in production or any \nstate full loads such as database and uh \nyou could do backups before you could \nkind of do them before because you could \ndo them at an infrastructure level \nbasically manually deviate writes its \nfiles on disk so you could take a \nsnapshot of that particular disk and \nstore it somewhere dude with your your \ncloud provider but that that's not a \nreally smooth process this would \nbasically would give you a vendor \nlock-in for that specific vendor so you \ncouldn't really migrate you would be \nkind of left or you would leave vv8 in \nthis kind of weird state where it wasn't \nreally ever prepared to to take copies \nof files or unrestore you would get \nthese like weird error messages did vv8 \ncrash instead trying to recover \num yeah so it was It was kind of \npossible but it just wasn't a very good \nuser experience and deviate is all about \nuser experience so now we've kind of \ndone the exact same opposite and now we \nhave a backup feature with the user \nexperience that we're absolutely proud \nof with the the 1.15 release you can \nbackup and restore it to any a cloud \nprovider or to your local file system so \nwe have support for AWS S3 or any S3 \nimplementation actually doesn't have to \nbe the AWS one it could also be an open \nsource one for example \num for for Google Cloud GCS for a local \nfile system and basically these can all \nbe be plugged in using v8's module \nsystem and then you can just do a single \ncommand we have support for this and all \nof our our clients and all of our \nlanguage clients or you could just send \nthe raw HTTP request to start a backup \nand and that's it basically in bb8 will \ndo all the cool things in the background \nand it's been engineered to be minimally \nintrusive basically so you can keep \nusing Vivian in fact we encourage you to \nto do this in production and basically \nkeep running vv8 in production send \nrequests have your users use the machine \nthey can even send right requests in the \nway that it's architect architected \nwithout any kind of impact and yeah the \nbackups will just run in the in the \nbackground and then you can restore them \neither onto the same machine or even \nonto a different machine if you like \nyeah and I think that the ux the design \nand the documentation that shows you how \nto do it is so well communicated and \nreally you know massive credit to how \nyou've written the how how we V8 stays \nrunning all the time how you can select \ncertain classes and I want to get right \nback to the ux but this little story \nabout not backing up your data I really \nlike this uh this HBO show Silicon \nValley I imagine like a lot of our \nlisteners maybe have seen this show and \nenjoyed the show and there's a scene \nwhere where Richard is he hasn't backed \nup the data they have like this \ninsurance client Dan Melcher and and \nthey're all panicking that we you know \nwe have no backup of our data in them \nand it like they're they try to like \nmigrate their server to Stanford and it \nfalls apart but then the systems back \nitself up on the refrigerators and it's \nthis really funny scene in that show but \nkind of communicating that urgency of \nlike you need to have your data back \nexactly \nyou do and nvv it gives you a proper way \nto do that now no refrigerators involved \nat all \nyeah and so one thing about the ux is I \nwas curious about this notion of backing \nup specific classes so I imagine I have \nlike 60 classes and I only want to back \nup some of them and the ux makes it so \nclear of how you include certain classes \nand can you tell me about the design \ndecisions behind that part of it yeah \nyeah absolutely so this is actually uh \nmainly based on user feedback so the \nentire feature was uh developed around \nusers input like of course you you ask \nyour users before you write the first \nline of code \num and then you try and try and get \nfeedback and this is something that that \nwas very very heavily influenced from \nCommunity feedback so basically the idea \nbehind the the backup system is I I \nthink there are so many use cases that \nyou can do like you can even use it to \nto migrate between environments and \nthese kind of things but generally I see \ntwo main use cases for a backup like one \nis the disaster recovery case where \nbasically the disk is lost or or someone \ndeletes it or this kind of basically to \nto take all the data be very agnostic of \nwhat data is on there and just take the \nwhole thing basically back it up and \nrestore it that's one option the other \noption is basically more at a yeah \nlogical level where you know what your \nspecific classes mean and you maybe you \nwant to create a backup not so much to \nprotect against Hardware failure or or \ncloud provider failure but against user \nerrors so for example \num a user could accidentally delete data \njust through the API so if you want to \nprotect against that then you would do a \nsort of uh yeah I would also do a backup \nbut it would be more to to protect \nagainst user actions and more this kind \nof application Level backup and there \nyou might not want to back up the entire \ndatabase \nfor example of course vv8 can be used \nfor for all kinds of different use cases \nand then I know of some that use classes \nbasically as their their isolation unit \nfor multi-tenancy so they would have \ntheir own service that that runs for \ntheir customers and each customer would \nproduce one or or not Direct but \nbasically their application would would \ncreate one or more classes inside VBA \nthat belonged to exactly one customer so \nmaybe they have a requirement maybe for \nfor \num sock 2 or gdpr or something that \ncustomer data needs to store be stored \nin a specific way so that would be one \noption for example to just create a \nbackup for a specific class and the API \nis designed in a way that gives you \nthree options basically you can provide \nno information at all this way it would \njust take a backup of the entire \ninstance with everything that's that's \non there or you could set an explicit \nlist of classes so then basically only \nwhat's included in the class would be \nbacked up or you could do the other way \naround where everything except basically \nwe have this exclude field and you can \nsay like okay \num don't exclude this or don't include \nthis class basically exclude this class \nbecause it's sensitive for something and \nthen it would create a backup of all the \nother classes \num so see I said like different classes \nmight be you need more secure more like \nlet's back this up every hour or so and \nthen other things it's like well we need \nto back this up put it behind some \nsecurity because this is particularly \nsensitive yeah I think that's really \ninteresting great Point yeah think about \nall different the timing timing plays a \nbit role like you could have a class \nthat rarely changes but is maybe very \nlarge why would you back it up all the \ntime or you could have another class \nthat yeah that frequently changes and \nyou need much more frequent updates so \nyeah that's also a nice way to decouple \nthis a bit basically and just give you \nall the flexibility to to Really \num yeah from a technical perspective \nit's just a single call but you can do a \nlot with it you can customize it in \nwhatever way you want \nuh one thing I'm kind of struggling to \nwrap my head around is um so when you \nback it up what is the kind of state \nlook like and does it differ from like \nS3 because S3 is just like a file \nstorage thing right or uh so when it's \nbacked up is it like uh Json or file of \ndata what what is the backup thing the \nthe backup is almost an exact copy of um \nwhat you would have on your disk in VBA \nnormally so it's basically the the \nbinary file formats for for the LSM \ntrees for the the hnsw index for other \nindex types that we have so so for bm25 \nfor example there's a a simple index \nthat tracks a property length because \nyou need these like average property \nlengths for the vm25 uh combination and \nand other basically \nmetadata that we need for for \nmaintenance so it's almost an exact copy \nof those files and then there is a \nsnapshot I think it's actually called \nsnapshot Json but that's that's \nbasically just an implementation detail \nthat gives you a bit of info about the \nthe backup itself so it's like what what \nkind of machine was it running on \num when was the backup created what's \nthe the ID of the backup and these kind \nof things and that's basically the the \nmetadata that that makes this backup a \nsort of self-contained backup I would \nsay and and what that what I mean with \nthat is basically you could create so \nlet's say you have two instances one is \nyour production instance \num and the other one is let's say your \nlocal instance which is completely empty \nand now you want to migrate basically \nusing using backups your data from the \nreduction instance to the cloud provider \nand then basically pull back the the \num the backup from the cloud provider \nthen all you have to do is send the \nrequest from the production instance put \nit into let's say S3 in this S3 bucket \nand then on your local machine as long \nas it's configured to to point to the \nsame S3 bucket you can restore that \nexact same \num backup just by specifying its ID and \nthe the local instance doesn't need to \nknow anything thing about your \nproduction instance so you don't have to \ndo any like pre-configuring basically \nthe the backup is completely \nself-contained with everything that it \nneeds to to be runnable \nthis \nso one thing I'm very curious about is \nwith say the collection of demos and on \nuh GitHub we've yet examples we have \nthings like you know uh clip demo with \nthe with the UI and searching through \nmovies searching through wines all these \nexamples and I love this idea of getting \nwevia demos of here's a graphql API that \nstarts through Wikipedia search through \narchive maybe complete with the UI also \nwith with this backup because I'm \nthinking about how I think right now you \nclone it locally and then spin it up and \nhave it running would instead just kind \nof restoring from a backup be an easier \nway to run the demo yourself yeah \nabsolutely so so basically because the \nthe backup and restore is yeah it is \njust copying of files that also means \nany kind of index building that you have \nto do that's already that's already \ncontained \num so let's say you have this this \nmassive instance where you have hundreds \nof millions of objects and took you \nmaybe over a day to index it if you \ncreate the backup the backup is just \ncopying the files expensive we have all \nthe the index structures that have \nalready been built and then if you want \nto restore it so let's say you want to \nyeah run a demo case and and we've \nbasically just put the demo data set \ninto a backup and you restore from that \nthat would yeah that would make it a \nsuper fast process because you you \nbasically just wait for the time it \ntakes to copy the files and once they're \nthere you can start it up and you can \nuse it yeah wow that's incredible then \nyou avoid the import time and just back \nup wow so I think that was a great \ncoverage of backups and for people \nlistening we have you know these seven \ndifferent things that I outlined in the \nbeginning that are going to be chunked \nup in chapters and Dirk is going to be \ncoming on in the second half to discuss \nuh the red black trees in this thing but \nthe next Topic at Ian could we talk \nabout the go mem limit you've written \nthis great article how does this help \nleave you yeah thank you for for \nbringing up the the article \num the the go mem limit is one of those \nfeatures where we really benefit from \nthe goal language Community being active \nand improving go itself so a lot of the \nimprovements that we do in viviate \nthey're typically code that we ride \nwhere we've done something that maybe \nwasn't ideal before and now we've we \nfound a better way or we've just \nimproved it in in general so so for \nexample the the \num memory uh improvements or allocation \nimprovements for filtered aggregations \nthat you're talking about with Dirk \nlater \num they are are something where \nbasically we've just written better code \nbut go mem limit is one of the those few \nthings basically where we didn't have to \ndo much other than \num compile the binaries for \num for the new 1.15 version with the \nlatest version of go because this is a \nnew feature that go actually introduced \nand go memed is basically a soft memory \nlimit and soft means that that go cannot \nprevent your memory from growing beyond \nthat limit so it's not a hard limit \nbasically the kernel has a heart limited \ndoes an out of memory kill if the memory \nis exceeded and that's basically that's \nthe hard limit but it's it's a Target \nand a Target is super important for a um \nfor a garbage collected language because \nby default in go the target would always \nbe twice of what you have so to put that \nin simple terms let's say your your \napplication currently uses two gigabytes \nof memory and and you want it to use to \ngive us like that's not accidental or or \ntemporary allocations but that is let's \nsay you want to keep your vectors in \nmemory and this is two gigabytes of \nvectors then with that Target being to \ndouble so it's called 100 in in Gold \nlanguage basically it's a go GC equals \n100 and that would mean that your \ninstance can grow all the way up to four \ngigabytes and that's relatively small \nnumbers so that's that might still be \nokay you might have a four gigabyte \ninstance but now let's say you have this \nmassive setup and your stable memory is \n200 gigabytes most likely you don't have \na 400 gigabyte instance just to have a \nbuffer for for temporary allocations you \nwould have let's say maybe 20 overhead \nand you would have a 240 gigabyte \nmachine now if you set your your \num uh go GC instead of to double to 20 \nthat would work for this particular case \nbut a you have to know exactly where you \nend up which is the 200 gigabyte you \nhave to know exactly how much you have \nand that means that to get there you \nalready had a basically very aggressive \ngarbage collector because it was set to \nto 20 which means you've spent a lot of \ntime on garbage collection which might \nnot be something that you you would want \nto to do and go mem limit basically is \nthe the missing turning knob here it's \nactually not turning up to maybe sort of \nsort of a knob that turns itself because \nit basically turns the the other knob \nthe gochi Cena which basically in a um \nin a single sentence the closer your \nmemory usage gets to the Limit the more \naggressive it makes the garbage \ncollector so in the beginning on your \n240 gigabyte machine you have all the \nmemory in the world there's no reason to \nsave memory so go can for example double \nthe Heap every time that's fine but at \n220 gigabytes or 200 gigabytes with 240 \ngigabyte limit you can't double anymore \nand this is exactly what go limit does \nin the background it would then make the \nthe go garbage collector quite \naggressive and then you would never sort \nof run out of memory again when you \nthink you shouldn't have because you've \ncalculated your stable memory \nrequirements and it was all fine and \num yeah long story short all you have to \ndo is set a single configuration \nenvironment variable which is this go \nmem limit and you just put it to however \nmemory you have and if there is a way \nthat the go runtime can can prevent it \nby basically making the garbage \ncollector more aggressive it's got your \nback and it will will take care of not \ngoing over there what it can do of \ncourse is if you if you keep on \nimporting and you have vectors that \nrequire 260 gigabytes of memory on a 200 \ngigabyte a 40 gigabyte machine that will \nstill run out of memory but for those \ncases where you kind of accidentally ran \nout of memory it will prevent those and \nI think that's that's super cool for \nhaving to do nothing but but yeah \nupgrading to the latest version and \nsetting a new environment variable \nyeah super interesting I I'm not going \nto claim to be a knowledgeable about go \nreally but I've seen like these Cuda om \nerrors where you try to put a big \ngradient through the thing and add a \nmemory programs crashing and so I can I \ncan Reason by analogy there where you're \ntrying to import too much data and then \nit crashes compared to this thing that \ncan manage it and I I feel like that's \nsuch a huge thing that things would say \num like gradient accumulation in deep \nlearning is just kind of an analogy that \nI'm going to be using to reason about \nthis like the way that it prevents you \nfrom the oom error has been such a game \nchanger with training big models with \nyou know big batch sizes and it sounds \nlike a very similar thing with this and \nso from my understanding it sounds like \num you know with the aggressive garbage \ncollector it might slow it down when you \nget to that limit maybe because it's uh \nso I think it's what you do is maybe you \nover you have like a 32-bit about like \nplaceholder right the temporary \nallocation is trying to kill those to \nmake them for more data \nyeah yeah so the slowing down is is kind \nof an effect what it does is basically \nit speeds up the garbage collector \nitself so so basically the garbage \ncollector the or the point of the \ngarbage collector is to to for for any \nkind of memory that was used temporarily \num in a garbage collected language is \nnot freed immediately basically the \ngarbage collector just runs in intervals \nand collects all that memory so that it \ncan be reused again and the longer it it \ndoesn't run basically so the longer the \npass between two cycles the more memory \npiles up and if you're getting close to \nyour memory limit then it basically has \nto run more aggressively and that kind \nof automatically does that trade-off \nwhere you only have this many CPUs and \nif your CPUs do more garbage collection \nthat means they do less other things so \nyes you you kind of trade off a bit of \nof compute uh Power for more garbage \ncollection power and and therefore \nprevent running out of memory if it's \npreventable \nso does this help with say uh like \nlarge-scale load tests get a billion \nvectors into Eva does this kind of thing \nfacilitate that yeah yeah exactly so so \nthe the higher your your regular Heap \nuse or I think I use the the term uh \nlong lift versus versus temporary so \nbasically the the higher your long lift \nHeap or memory usage isn't that is \nexactly what happens in in such a \nbillion scale case because those billion \nvectors they will use I don't know \nincluding the index something like one \nor two terabytes probably depending on \nthe dimensionality so I think that the \nSif 1B data set is something that we've \nplayed around with and I think it's it's \na billion uh vectors at 128 Dimensions \num yeah and that's that's four bytes for \nper Dimension so that is not going to \ncalculate them in my head on the podcast \nbut that is a lot and I think if you \ntake into account the the \num the space for the index itself we \nended up with something like one \nterabyte or 1.2 terabytes and yeah if \nyou have these kind of kind of massive \nlimits then it really helps if you can \nset your go mem limit so that the \ngarbage collector doesn't need this \nmassive overhead because even just 10 is \n120 gigabytes at 1.2 terabytes and \nthat's a lot \nwow yes super interesting you've got \nthree main topics to discuss on \nimproving the performance of Eva so Dirk \nthank you so much for uh coming on the \npodcast to explain these new ideas \nyeah thank you for inviting me happy to \nbe here \nso could we start with uh what is a red \nblack tree how's it different from a \nregular binary tree and how does this \nhelp with vva's performance uh I would \njust stop by suspending what the binary \ntree is so let's say you have a bunch of \nnumbers and you want to find out if a \nnumber is on your list and \num like classical approach would be you \njust have a long list and you go through \nit and check everyone at every number \nand that's slow because you might have \nto check each entry before you know it \nand what you can do is you \num sort this into a tree \nso let's say you have numbers from 0 to \n100 you pick a middle note let's say 50 \nas the root note and then if you want to \ncheck if 7 is in your in your tree you \ngo in and say okay yeah fifty Seven is \nsmaller than that so I take the left \nentry and the left entry might be 33 and \nwe go okay seven is smaller than 33 I go \nagain in the left \nthree until you are at the bottom and \nthey're found to seven or not and that \nlets you check if the number is inside \nwith a lot less steps then compared to \njust going through \num to a list \nnow \num if you create these trees you can \nhave problems \num \nif you enter objects in order \nlet's say the tree is empty and you \nstart entering entering numbers in it \nand let's say you start with with one \nthen one is your first object the root \nof the tree then you enter two then okay \ntwo is larger than one so you go to the \nright and the right child of one is now \nthe two and now if the three comes you \ngo in three is larger than zero and so \nlarger than one go to the right note \nwhich is two three is larger than two \nyou go to the right and enter it there \nand you can continue on that until \nyou're at whatever numbers you are and \nthen your binary tree is basically a \nlist \nattitude to find any object you start at \nthe first and you're the right to write \nthe right to write the right right until \nyou're there and so it doesn't improve \nthe uh performance when when looking up \nthings and also when writing objects \ninto the street \nand now the uh well black tree is a \nself-balanced tree so there are a bunch \nof rules associated with the tree and \nthen you rebalance \nthe tree when certain things happen as \nof course the example for example the \nexample I just gave it's you have then \nyou enter the tree so you have done \nthree nodes on the right and zero on the \nleft so you're just like this rotate it \naround that the two is the new roots and \nthen you have on the right the three and \non the left the one and then you have a \ngaps of one instead of a depth of two \nand that makes it then faster than \nentering and reading notes from it super \ncool and yeah so around the 1.15 release \nI will have a blog post it'll probably \nbe an in description of this video and \nit's released that'll visually describe \nthis concept of how you rotate the trees \nthe red red black coloring and maybe \nyou're aware of things like visual algo \nthese these ideas of um you know the red \nblack coloring how that lets you balance \na binary tree before we go a little \ndeeper into how binary search trees help \nwith databases to look into IDs can you \ntell me about your experience \nimplementing this in weediate um like \nhow what what do you change what kind of \nlike in the code base the kind of Open \nSource database engine this kind of \ntopic \num so we already have a binary tree in \nthere where you when you insert the \nobjects at first and \num basically the change was was limited \nto the existing binary tree \nimplementation that we already have so \nbasically I implemented checks are the \nrules \num I just can't think afterwards is any \nof the rules are not developed anymore \nand if yes do the appropriate rotation \nchanging values around \num to to have it balanced so the red red \nreflectory itself is an idea I think \nfrom the 70s or the 80s so it's around \nsince quite a while \num but it works great so \nyeah so all this is implemented in go \nhave you been how long have you been \nprogramming and go what was your journey \nlike learning it two months so I started \nI started working on really AIDS um yeah \nearly July and I I started \nI don't know maybe two three weeks \nbefore it was my first girl college \num but but it's just surprisingly fast \nlike I was \num answer it first I'll just put the \ngovernment like it's really quick that \nyou get you took out that's a great \nexperience \nsuper cool I think that's really \ninteresting that it takes took you two \nmonths to learn go and this kind of Open \nSource database you know upgrading \nlittle Parts like binary tree to red \nblack tree these kind of updates can we \ncan we maybe step a bit into the \nmotivation of the red of the binary tree \nuh so so we say we have these uuids they \nuniquely identify every item in our \ndatabase could be images you know \npassages paragraphs whatever you put in \nyour vector in the web Vector database \nso how does so the uuids they get sorted \nin in the tree is that the key idea for \nwhen you like how you use this kind of \nstructure \num would be an example let's say you \nhave a uid that is \num just a counter that goes up \nand then if you insert it you would get \nexacted behaviors I described earlier \nthat you insert the first object that is \nyour root insert the object that's your \nright side that object it's your text \nright child and so on and that just \nreally degrades the performance when you \nadd objects \nand makes it makes it very slow because \nevery time you use an object you have to \ngo through all the objects you added \nbefore before you can write it \nand for the next object it's even longer \nso it gets really slow and yeah \nso I kind of have two things I want to \ntake this in but first so so say um you \nknow if you're looping through your data \nin on the client side say you've got \npython code and you're looping through \nthe data items and you're using that \nLoop counter to construct the uuid is \nthat the kind of idea where your one two \nthree four and such that you get this \nright except for anything going on the \nright now does this also play with say \nwe have an inverted index and we have uh \nI don't know age uh or let's say some \nnumeric value with a broader range than \nthat let's say maybe uh \num maybe we have \nuh income and some database I don't know \nwe have a big set of numbers in the \ninverted index does the binary tree also \nhelp with that kind of lookup \nuh I'm sorry I don't know that like as I \nsaid I just started so I I don't fully \nunderstand the journey sorry let me set \nthe stage better that was a bad example \nso so with the inverted index it's like \num those the foundational idea is say \nyou have a textbook and you're looking \nfor biology you go to the back of the \ntextbook it says biology is on page 99 \npage 305 inverted index so um so I think \nwith numeric values we can also kind of \nhave this \nuh inverted index where say let's say \nit's age and it's one to a hundred you \nknow you'd say 80 and then your database \nis indexed where you have 80 and then \nthe customers or whatever it is that \nhave that value 80. could we imagine \nnumeric values like that his age say \nit's like zero to 100 I think you need \nsomething like a key that identifies an \nobject \nso you can like you can store as a value \nwhatever you want so you could have 50 \nvalues with a given key \num \nbut I'm \nI'm not sure if you could use it for for \nwhat you have in mind so in general is \nyou have a bunch of objects that haven't \nhave a unique key and you want to insert \nor get them out of a structure quickly \nthat's I think that that's where you use \nthese these binary trees and red black \ntrees are then if you have \num ordered rights helps you to keep the \nperformance up \nright yeah I can certainly imagine how \nto say um with wevia when you're doing a \nnear object search and you pass in the \nID of the object to reference the vector \nof that object having this kind of \nstructure to quickly get it grab the \nvector search with it obviously sounds \nsuper useful yeah I think like I'm not \ntotally sure about this but there is \nthis I've got what is it called uh h n s \nw and did I get that right \num it works kind of into the same direct \nobviously it's a lot more complicated \nbut in I get I would say the idea behind \nit is similar but obviously it's more \ncomplex and \num \nhelps you to to find find it but this is \nlike the implementation where I work on \nthe 3D to to \nyou get objects into vv8 you first store \nthem \nand then you do other things later it's \nI don't think it takes part in the in \nthe search \nor in the indexing data \nyeah that's such a fascinating \nconnection between say tree structures \nfor fast search or the proximity graphs \nhierarchical proximity graph structure \nof hsw the way that we have these like \nsymbolic structures to organize data for \nfast lookup super interesting and I \nguess my understanding of it is you know \nif you do a near object search where you \npass in an ID you can use the balanced \nred black balance binary binary search \ntree to quickly get that ID quickly get \nthe vector then you take that Vector on \nthe road to the hnsw index to now do \nthat approximate nearest neighbor but so \nkind of stepping out of this topic can \nwe now talk about the second topic on \nour agenda um fewer memory allocations \non filtered aggregations could maybe \nbegin with the filtered aggregations and \nand kind of understanding the current \nmemory overhead and then kind of what's \nbeen done to help with that yeah \num yeah so maybe we do it for the \naggregation so we're looking for for a \nvalue that's for example Nia another \nlike sorry an object entry in the \ndatabase it's near another entry and \num there was a lot of overhead involved \nin temporary allocations while doing \nthis \num I think something like so we we did a \nbenchmark where we added one million \nobjects to bb8 and then \naggregation rate for example would just \ncount how often is this property there \nand with this we had \nI think 200 gigabytes of just temporary \nallocations that would happen while \nlooking for \nby checking how many other \nand \num yeah there were a lot of different \ninefficiencies I would say in the code \nthat that you could optimize \num in general like this the the stack \nand the Heap \num where you can store memory and go \nwell in general and \num \nif you start on this you can store \nthings on the stack where you a know how \nbig it is \nand \nB it doesn't escape so let's say you \nhave a function you allocate some memory \nthere and then you return it up the \nstack to whatever column you don't know \nwhat's happening afterwards so you need \nto have it at the place where it can \ndynamically grow or Shrink or the the \nlifetime is not limited and so it goes \nonto the Heap \nuh if you have a variable that you \ncreate in a function you only use it in \nthat function and afterwards it's gone \nyou can put it on the stack where it's \nmuch cheaper to create and to uh read \nand \num so I would say there were three or \nfour different patterns that I noticed \nthe first one is \num we the the objects we store them in \nLong byte areas so it's just a long area \nof bytes \nand then if you for example want to \ncheck or I want to read all the \nproperties from it \num \nthen there was a library that was used \nit was called second binary.read I think \nand this just created lots of \nallocations for this process yeah so if \nyou say oh I want to have \num \nthis is the the buffer from which I'm \nreading where the object is stored in I \nwant to read the first 20 bytes because \nthey mean the the ID of the object then \nyou could tell that to the to that \nlibrary and it would give you those \nfirst 20 bytes \num and would create a bunch of temporary \nallocations by doing that \num it's nice to use but that makes makes \nit slow and so I basically created a \nlittle low level library that just \num \nreads from underlying buffer how many \nbytes you want without any temporary \nallocations and that's yeah then use \nthat library at different places and and \nmake it yeah somewhat user friendly \num \n[Music] \nyeah yeah so I'm sorry to be you know \nI'll be re-watching this and hopefully \nwrap my head around the full the idea \nbut um maybe so a filtered aggregation \nis say we're we have a hundred million \npassages in Wikipedia say we're trying \nto uh average out the word counts of \nthem or something like that right is \nthat it so that's a filtered aggregation \nuh yeah so so each Wikipedia Passage \nuh with its respective properties like \nword count is stored as like a byte \nstring yes so you can better hash out \nthe thing that you're trying to filter \non \num \nso basically you know do you have to \nhold object like the complete object is \none long bite string and there you have \nto to get to the to the right \nplay so you you basically get that long \nthing and then you know okay the first \neight bytes are the ID of the object \nthen there's a bunch of other things and \nthen there is um \nlet's say the length of the of the key \nof the object so you first you first \nneed to go to the place where the key is \nthat you read the key then you know okay \nthe next 53 bytes are the key \nif you need it you read those if not you \njust jump over it and then you do that \nuntil you're at the place where the \ninformation is that you're looking for \nand basically with the old library you \nhad to read everything and every read \ncreated many allocations and now this \nnew library basically allows you okay \num I want to read like I know the next \nvalue like the next thing I'm reading is \nlet's say an unsigned in 64. so you do \nreads unsigned in 64. you get that value \nback and the internal pointer the points \nwhere in the buffer eyes jumps forward \nand you do that until you are at the \nright place in the buffer where the \ninformation is that you need \nsuper cool so it sounds like it would be \nespecially useful if you have say a lot \nof properties like data objects that \nhave several properties but especially \nbenefit from this kind of technique and \nmaybe one more thing I'm missing in my \nunderstanding is so so the temporary \nallocations \nso is that um so you copy the whole \nthing could you take me through it a \nlittle a little more sorry to be okay \nokay let's start from a bit let's say we \nhave a \nan object that and the the buffer where \neverything is stored is 10 000 entries \nlong and then what was done before is \nthose 10 000 entries were given to that \nbinary dot read library and they would \nsay Okay read me the first four bytes \nread between the next 20 by three \nmillion next five bytes and so on and \neach of these calls the library created \nin the library so not in our code but in \nthe library code a bunch of temporary \nallocations where they just created \nbuffers \nfor whatever reason like I haven't \nlooked at their code so I don't know it \nand um \nbasically what's happening now is you \nhave two choices a is move the position \ninside the buffer forward without \nreading anything so if you know all the \nfirst 80 bytes don't matter because it \nis information I don't need you just say \nmove position forward and the internal \nnumber that says omx by 15 is just moved \n80 by 80 entries forward if you then say \nOh I know now I'm reading uh answer \ninteger 64. you call the read answer \ninteger 64 call \nand it then reads the next uh eight \nbytes interprets them in a way that \ndoesn't use any temporary allocation and \nreturns you the value \nso having that Precision on um \nknowing that you're going to read a \n32-bit value that that reduces \nI think that makes sense I so that \nreduces the uh because otherwise you \nneed to allocate the 64-bit no do you \nalways no \num \nyou always need to know what comes next \nso you have a you have a format and you \nknow in in my long long white area that \ndescribes the um the the object \nlike the first eight bytes are some ID \nthen some other thing comes then this \ncomes and then \num the length of the t comes which isn't \nunsigned 32-bit value and so on and \num \nso you always know what to read \nit's just are you doing it in efficient \nway or unefficient way basically and \nthis this library was doing in an \nunefficient way I don't know why and \nlike I haven't looked in that code but \nit \num \nyeah it probably does a bunch of other \nthings and for example it works for \nfiles and for any buffer which makes it \nreally nice to use you can use the same \nfunctions on uh like reading a file and \nreading some byte area probably all's \nNetwork also I don't know that and now I \nbasically I created some specialized \nfunction which does a subset of the the \nspinal.read library does but for us it \ndoes what we need at this place and it \ndoes it more efficiently \nwow so so I guess \nthe high level takeaway is that you can \nyou know do these aggregations with less \nmemory requirements but yes I'm so \nfascinated at how you're able to kind of \ngo into the database code and make these \nmodifications even with you know two \nmonths ago and replace this library with \nthis thing it's really opening my \nthinking of about this kind of like open \nsource database and the different \ncomponents of the databases that you can \nimprove on you know from The Balancing \ntrees for the sequential rights to the \nmemory allocations on these aggregations \nis super interesting uh so we're not \ngoing to do our third topic um so with \nless memory construct consumption with \nimporting many parallel bashes I think \num you know just importing data I love \nthis topic trying to better understand \nit myself so I'm so excited to learn \nabout what's new with this yeah so \num what we were doing up to now is uh \nlike you have your clients and then you \nfor ads \ndata in batches to to vv8 and you for \nexample do it over Network so you just \nhave five clients that you run in \nparallel that each send their batches to \ndeviate \nand that can processed there and uh what \nwas done up to now is that for each \nbatch that gets imported a number of \ngo routines are started they do the \nactual importing so if the first batch \narrives \num we will start \nbasically a number of CPU cores go \nroutines and those girl routines then \nwork through the to the objects that are \nin the batch and and add them to the \nactual database and the same happens for \nthe second and the third the fourth and \nso on so if you have 10 batches in \nparallel you start 10 times your number \nof course goal routines that work in \nparallel importing those objects \nand \num each worker has a memory cost \nassociated with it \nso every worker that started \num has certain certain things it does \nand does it memory so if you have then \n10 batches you have that 100 times \nand \num so I've got that number from etn I \nhaven't measured it myself but like he \ntried to import many objects I think he \nlike \nI think he said the billion but I'm not \ntotally sure if it was a billion and at \nsome point on a really big machine \num like 40 of all memory that's used was \nfrom these workers and at a certain \namount of time a certain point like the \nimport doesn't get faster if you add \nmore gold routine so you just add more \nmemory that gets allocated and used \nbut the total throughput doesn't get \nhigher anymore yeah wow this is \nincredible the I mean the thinking \naround if I want to import a billion \nvectors into vva that I can distribute \nit across say 10 like uploaders \ncould we talk about that idea a bit more \nso um \nbecause it would speed it up it kind of \nreminds me almost of like distributed \ntraining with deep neural networks and \nthe same kind of you know distributed \ndata uploading what else goes into a \ndistributed data uploading with I mean \nimagine the red black tree balancing it \nisn't it probably needs to be some kind \nof synchronization step right like \nI mean the the that's a different point \nso first you you kind of Center the \nobjects to vv8 and then you \num put each object into vb8 and um and \nyou have clients let's say the python \nclient and that just has overhead and \nyou you can't send the data from one \nclient fast enough to to saturate like a \nbig server but you have BBI running and \nso if you instead of just having one \nclient sending data you have two or \nthree clients then \num you come to a point where you really \nuse up all the resources that the the \num the the server has so in my local \ntest on my machine \nthere is no real point in having two or \nthree in parallel that doesn't make it \nlike maybe a little bit faster up to a \npoint but then it gets lower but \nif you have this this remote setup so \nyou're sending over over Network you \nhave latency you have throughput issues \nthen it can help to have multiple \nbatches in parallel \nso so maybe we could um Step through so \nthe the memory overhead of each of the \nclients what what is it that the clients \nneed to store that creates the overhead \noh it's not the clients but \num it's the these workers that take the \nobject and actually add it to \num to \nto vv8 and they have some temporary \nstructures where they where they uh like \nthat's one of the parts I have looked at \nso I I don't know it yet but \num they have some temporary errors where \nthey check oh \num \nI already looked at a bunch of other \nobjects and now the new object is \ndifferent but yeah I can't really \nexpanded the story about that one and \num so basically what we've done is now \ninstead of \nstarting a number of go routines with \neach batch that comes there's a shared a \npool of girl routines that that works on \nthe object of all batches \nso let's say you have 10 clients sending \ndata you're sending batches in then all \nthe objects from these batches get added \nto one queue \nand then the shared workers just \ntake the first increase at the database \nas soon as one is done it takes the next \none so you always have the same number \nof of workers \nadding \nobjects and it doesn't like the number \nof broadcast doesn't get up uh doesn't \nscale up if you have more batches and so \nyou you are limited in the growth of of \nmemory usage so if you have many batches \nbecause you don't have this many \nparallel operations that are going on \ncould you tell me Limited in the um in \nthe memory of the of the patch can you \nexplain that one a little more yes \num \nso each worker that adds the objects to \nthe database create some temporary \nstructures as I said before I'm not \ntotally sure what they contain but \nthey they need some memory to do their \nwork so if you have 10 you have 10 times \nthose temporary structures if you have \n100 you have 100 times those temporary \nstructures so \num \nif you know say okay I'm limited it to \n10 or 20 workers that go in parallel you \nlimit the amount of memory they use for \nwhile importing it and \num \nprobably that as kind of a trade-off so \nif you have more goal routines up to a \npoint it gets faster let's say you would \nchange just one worker one gold routine \nwork in parallel then it would be much \nlower then you have five if you have a \nfive core machine but if you are going \nto 50 then on your five call machine the \n50 is going routine won't help you \nadding things faster but it will still \nconsume memory but you can't use any \nother things \nso the the client is Freer to go get the \nnext day so the network part is faster \nand so when you have 50 \nthat um no like the the clients stay the \nsame the networks stay the same what's \ndifferent is how deviate like in deviate \nhow vv8 accepts the objects and then \nadds it to the database \nso vva test instead of having a hundred \ngoal routines working paralleling the \nobject that only has 10 or 15 or \nwhatever you put in uh okay because it \nneeds less temporary structure yes you \nhave less gold routines working parallel \nand deviate so you have less of these \ntemporary objects adding uh use \nso you have less over memory consumption \nso then as a result can you add even \nmore data to it like \num \nit scales a bit better if you have um if \nyou have many batches then it's a bit \nfaster not too much but a little bit I \nthink the most important thing is if \nyou're adding lots of objects in \nparallel then just your memory is is \ngrowing so much that you're running out \nof memory at a certain point \nand like this is this is what goes away \nor \nit's lower so you basically you can \nimport more objects with the same amount \nof memory \nsuper cool so so I think that was a \ngreat coverage of the three topics of \nyou know self-balancing red black trees \nto improve the sequential rights fewer \nmemory allocations and filtered \naggregations and as we just finished up \non less memory consumption when \nimporting many parallel batches um so \nquickly touching on a couple other uh \ntopics in the 1.15 release we have two \nnew distance metrics uh hemming distance \nin Manhattan distance uh Eddie could you \nquickly explain what they are and how \ncommunity members have contributed this \nyeah yeah so so first of all the fact \nthat Community members have contributed \nI'm super proud of that fact because for \nan open source product it's so nice to \nget these kind of outside contributions \nand \num yeah users having those use cases and \nknowing that they they need them and \nthen um they don't just have to put in a \nfeature request but they can also just \ndo it themselves that's really nice and \nit's really cool to to see that that \nkind of community usage uh yeah so so \nManhattan distance that that's one that \nI haven't actually used myself before \num but I like that I like the naming I \nthink an alternative names like taxi cap \ndistance and the idea is that you you \nhave a grid or like you City grit as you \nwould have in Manhattan and you can't \njust walk straight through a block so \nbasically the only way to navigate from \npoint A to point B is to actually walk \nthe the uh the grid basically in the \ngrid then would be your your axes in the \ncoordinate system and that's basically \nwhat the distance is so instead of \ntaking the diagonals you would in in \neuclidean distance you just take the \nsort of walk along the axes and um yeah \nI have no idea what use cases are are \nthere for what models use them but \napparently there are some because \ncommunity members like them \num then Hamming distance is one that I'm \na bit more familiar with because that's \nalso also used for binary passage \nretrieval \num we're basically Hamming distance just \ngives you the different uh bits or bytes \nor depending on on what it runs on if it \nruns on numbers then gives you the \ndifference between the numbers of each \nvector and um yeah on binary passage \nretrieval the the general ideas that you \ncompress this entire Vector into this \nkind of binary thing and then instead of \nlet's say with cosine calculating the \nentire angle basically you just compare \nyou just walk through all the bits and \nsee are they the same are they not the \nsame and if all the bits are the same \nthen the distance would be zero the \nvectors or the vectors the binary \nvectors would be identical and basically \nthe the worst possible score that you \ncould get is that every bit is different \num so I guess it's in computer science \nterms it's basically an xor kind of \ncalculation between the the two um \nvectors and uh yeah if all are different \nthan your maximum distance basically the \nnumber of bits or if it's on a number \nthe the vector Dimension and then that \nwould be like the the \nmost farthest apart vectors \num yeah um binary passenger retrievable \nAscent would be one of the the use cases \nyeah the new distance metrics are so \ninteresting I think so I think we've \ncovered five things now with uh you know \ncosine similarity being the foundational \none and then kind of dot product where \nyou remove the normalization from cosine \nsimilarity and euclidean and Manhattan \nwhich are similar kind of analogs of \neach other and now this Hamming distance \nthing which I think is pretty unique I \nremember doing bioinformatics classes \nwhere you look at like the RNA of \nmutated coronaviruses and so you'd have \nthis edit distance with the acgt \nvocabulary and so the edit distance and \nyeah the maybe the binary passage \nretrieval may be looking for these \nconnections and you know Eric has been \nreally studying these distance metrics \nand trying to prescribe things for webia \nusers like you know when to use which \none when and so looking at things like \naccuracy and speed I think you have the \nlittle reasoning around the speed where \nthe Manhattan should be faster because \nyou just have the differences you don't \nneed to square them some of the dot \nproduct you don't need to normalize them \nso it should be like a little bit faster \nbut generally I think the prescription \nis uh you know just try it see and see \nwhat your feeling is our current \nthinking so we also have these uh two \nnew hugging face modules or two new \nmodules that I think integrate with \nhiking face correct me if I'm wrong and \nsaying that they're kind of hugging face \nmodules but can you explain what I knew \nabout the new Wii date modules uh yeah \nyeah so one of those is actually uh \ncompletely hugging face specific so \nhugging face has an API where you can \nbasically dissipate service from from \nhugging face and uh basically they host \nthe model for you and they do the I \nthink it's called the the hugging face \ninference API and that's exactly exactly \nwhat it does \num so with vv8 modules or before all \nthat you could do with with eBay modules \nbasically spin the module up yourself \nbut if you maybe already have a hugging \nface a subscription you just want to \nintegrate with that because you're yeah \nyou're already using that and you're \nhappy with it \num the new module basic features gives \nyou an integration point to their API so \nthis is we call this from the mediates \nperspective it's basically a third-party \nintegration \num because it's it's \nfrom a technical perspective it's just a \nnetwork called to um this third party \nAPI \num but yeah it gives you completely new \nflexibility because every model that is \nsupported on unhiking face \num you can run it through vb8 and um you \ncan basically make use of all of the \noptimizations that the hug and face team \nhas been been doing already so if you \nare for example self-hosting vv8 but \ndon't want to self-host the inference \npart that would be one option and of \ncourse also with the VBA cloud service \num you can integrate it as well so you \ncan if you want a fully managed uh \noption then you can integrate as well \nand have basically the database part \nbeing managed by semi and the um \ninference part being managed by hugging \nphase and then the other module that we \nhave which is yet another Community \ncontribution which I'm I'm super proud \nof \num it's a summarization module which \nbasically it runs at at runtime or at \nquery time so similar to our q a module \nfor example \num which I think we call the category \nreaders and generators \num and yeah basically it takes your \nresults and if you want to it can \nsummarize results for you into something \ninto a shorter segment or so so if you \num run your search results for example \non very large documents but you want to \npreview them let's say in in yeah your \nsearch results page maybe that that's a \nvery simple and very much search related \nexample you could just generate such a \nsummary on the Fly and display it \nawesome well thank you so much Eddie and \neveryone we have again this recap of \ncloud native backups improved stability \nfor high memory setups faster Imports \nfor ordered objects with this \nself-balancing red black tree more \nefficient filter aggregations and then \nthe two new distance metrics and two new \nEva modules uh so I'm like a kind of \nlike a MC of a show now so following \nthis this is the conclusion of our \nversion 1.4 15 release uh now following \nis going to be some more information \nabout Dirk uh how did he become working \nwith edian on these performance \nimprovements what is his background like \nwhat led him to be thinking about these \nthings so I I hope you'll be sticking \naround to watch that part as well \nthanks for having me Dirk I'm really \ncurious like how how is your kind of \ncareer development been that you you \nknow you can identify these performance \nbottlenecks and develop things like this \num I'm I was a physicist uh so the the \nphysics Mazda PhD individual postdoc and \nthat basically wrote \num simulations about various barriers \ntopics \nand it's just natural to to \nlook for these performance optimization \nwhen you write the simulations and then \nmy my last job was at Deutsche Barn \nwhich is like a train company in Germany \nand uh it's part of a team that wrote \nthe simulation for microscopic train \nsimulations so \num yeah I did a lot more more \narchitecture and general design things \nthere was always this performance thing \nin the back or a part of of the work \ncan you tell me a little more about uh \nlike simulations simulation code and and \nkind of what what the experiments look \nlike for that \nuh it really depends so let's let's I \nwould I would go to university again \nbecause I think I'm not allowed to tell \ntoo much about my last job \num so I did there was like cell \nsimulation so how to sell moves how do \nthey interact and so on and \num \nin one of these projects for example we \nhad a lot of of noise how the cells \nwould move so that like we we were \nlooking at the collisions between cells \nand um you know you have them on a 1D \nstripe and they collide with each other \nand we had a little bit of noise so they \ndon't always go head-on but like this \nsometimes like this sometimes so they \nrotate a little bit and so you need a \nlot of \num with the same parameter sets you need \nmany runs so you can do some statistics \nif you just the wallet could be random \nthe outcome but if you do a thousand for \nthis parameter setting you know then oh \nthis place happens 20 times this case \nhappens 50 times then \num you can put a statistic and you can \ncompare different parameter sets so your \ncode needs to be fast enough to like \nexplore the relevant parameter space and \nhave enough runs so you can build up \nstatistics \nand so yeah \nit needs to be fast enough for that \nwell yeah can I ask about um what \ninspired your interest in we get \nuh it's a cool project so I I talked to \nthis with Etienne about it and it \nsounded really interesting and um I \nthought like I did simulations for 10 \nyears 12 years something like that and \nit's time to move on and do something \ndifferent and \num like I was very like close to machine \nlearning in my last project like didn't \ndo it myself but with the simulation it \nwas then used with machine learning and \nso I feel like I'm keeping this \ncloseness to machine learning but not \ndoing it myself \nand yeah \nalso very interesting going from the \nfrom the big corporate company to a \nsmall startup \noh yeah I'd love to talk about that as \nwell if I could stay on one more thing \nwith the what is the role of machine \nlearning in those simulations that you \ndescribe \num so University there was no machine \nlearning so I did experiment a little \nbit with like detecting the outcomes but \nit was just like very very very simple \num and then my last job basically the \nthe goal of the project was to automate \nscheduling \nlike long-term planning and short-term \nplanning \num so long-term planning sense of \nthe next schedule how all of our trains \ndrive to the network for the next half a \nyear and we have these requirements of \ntraining companies that try from here to \nthere from data here and so on and get a \nschedule where everything fits in \nand the second part short term let's say \nthree Falls over you can't drive all \nthose tracks anymore we need to reroute \neverything \nhow can we do it \num by staying as close as possible to \nthe original schedule and making our \npassengers arrive as as close to \noriginal time as possible and so I was \nbuilding with my team \num this micro microscopic train \nsimulations and then there was another \nteam that used reinforcement learning \nto try to learn with the simulation how \nto create conflict-free schedules and to \nreact to risk disruptions \nokay is there any scenario in which that \nwould be like the the vva data uploading \nwould be so chaotic that it would be an \nanalogous kind of system or is it I \nthought a bit about it but I I I don't \nthink like I I don't think there's a \nlike a direct connection \num I think possible learning like not \ntoo much into it but it's it's I think \nvery Niche and special like I think \ntheir profit rate fits great and \nmany way it doesn't \num \nyeah \nso sorry so it's like these really \ncomplex scheduling \nalgorithms is \nI guess I'm curious if like leviated \nthey say there's like a million clients \nuploading data and then you got to \nsynchronize it all get in the databases \nthat maybe analogous or is it I don't \nthink so no because um \nbut basically the the the the uh the \nproblems you have in the with the train \nsystem is that \ntrains cannot easily overtake each other \nso the the \num the order trains are in at a certain \npoint in time is really important and \nyou can have a train like I'm not using \nGerman cities but let's say one train \nstarting in Munich another train \nstarting in Berlin which is 500 \nkilometers away and they \nwould need to use the same piece of drag \nin five hours so the the the order which \nwill derived at that point like if the \nhigh speed train comes first so if the \nslow cargo train comes first really can \nmess up your schedule because if the \nhigh speed train is behind the the cargo \ntrain which drives really slow and can't \nbe overtaken then you have to ISP train \nbehind it going really slow forward and \num \nthat that's a real problem that can't be \nsolved with analytical methods so that's \nwhy we went the the AI route I think \nthis vv8 is uploading is you have a \nbunch of data you need to get it into \nthe database and the order doesn't \nreally matter and you just need to \nmake it efficient and um \nyeah what do you think about this idea \nsay we're we have like video data right \nthis video data could be like you know a \n30 second video is bullet train like \nit's you know it gets ready compared to \nlike a three hour video where \nright would that kind of thing maybe be \nsimilar \num I don't I don't I don't see a \nconnection there sorry \num \nyeah I um I think this this like this \nscheduling is so difficult because you \nhave everything affecting every \neverything else so each decision you do \nat one point can have a day later an \neffect somewhere else that you don't \nknow immediately and with with like \nadding things to bb8 the objects don't \ndepend on each other you need to get \nthem in without \nhaving bugs in your code like without \noverwriting anything else but besides \nthat they're independent from each other \nand it doesn't really matter if you add \na 30 minutes video or a 30 seconds video \nlike the the process of writing it will \nprobably take longer because you have \nmore data but \num \nI think besides that that it's not \nto pick off a connection \nmaybe with the cross-referencing there \ncould be some kind of \nbecause I think with the cross \nreferencing the current way that you \nneed to do it is you kind of have like a \nparent-child import where first you \nimport uh you know say it's articles and \nthen they have their paragraphs you need \nto first get the articles in there and \nthen you reference the paragraph So \nmaybe with these graph structures \nthere's some kind of scheduling to how \nyou orchestrate the referencing with \nuploading that could be like if it's \nreally complex and you have like \ncircular things that you need to break \nup and there it could be \num \nwell maybe let's say you're you're \ncreating objects on the Fly and then you \nneed to uh make sure that everything is \nin that you need and then a new object \nappears and then you need to reorder \neverything if you have that then it \nmight be but um I'm not sure how \nrealistic like how often that happens \nmaybe but \nsuper cool so can you tell me about your \nexperience at semi-technologies and you \nknow just kind of earlier topic we \npreviewed of working in a big \nCorporation compared to the startup yeah \num so I was like in the in the startup \nin the big company but then the or \nshould I say the big company came into \nthe startup and and so yeah meetings \ncorporate overhead and that was \nsometimes a bit too much and now I would \nsay it's it's very lean you really work \nmost of your time obviously can't you \ntalk to your colleagues sometimes when \nyou're there but you really have have \ntime to work so that's that's a \num a very nice nice change and like you \nstill have a feeling that you can that \nyou know everyone so \nlike in the old like the crew like I \nthink when I started with 60 people even \nover there left it was 250 so I kind of \nyou lose you don't know everyone in the \ncompany anymore and now I have to play I \nknow all the names and all the faces \num \nthat's the difference \nif I ask one more question about \num sort of your your motivation and kind \nof do you do you maybe have like an \napplication of we V8 like personally I \nlove the idea of searching through \nscientific papers and I I find every \nlittle grounding every little thing I'm \nworking on in that application to be \nvery motivating uh do you have that kind \nof thing or is it just about the \ntechnical of you know where can I find a \nperformance like I like personally I \nreally like to to coach and to \ncomplicated problems I I guess um \nnow when you set statistic papers if if \nyou have a lot of results from science \nlike you do experiments or you do \nsimulations and you have just a bunch of \nof results that you can't really look at \nanymore you'll have a possibility to \njust like send it to bb8 and do some \nsome \nbasic analytics in there like as I said \nwith my my simulations where you have \num where you have the cells crushing at \non and I really I look at a lot of \nvideos and I wrote like by hand the \nscript that oh if the cells are after \ncolliding at this far away in this case \nand \nyeah that was a bit annoying so if you \ncould automate that and \nhappy read in there that would be really \ncool and I \nI'm sure in larger projects I I did it I \nmostly worked alone with one or two \ncolleagues so we didn't add that much \ndata but if you're in a big \ncollaboration let's say \num at 7 or something \nwhere they have billions of terabytes if \nyou could help there \nI think that would be something that \nwould really fascinate me \nyeah well \nit does not as thing I thought about but \nthat kind of yeah like how cell \nsimulations I've heard of like maybe \nlike docking simulations I I don't \nreally know too much about this but this \nkind of you're simulating a bunch of \nlike um is it like electromagnetic \ninteractions like that kind of thing \nso we read it like effective interaction \nso we didn't go into the the like the \nphysical details of the electrons that \nthat um \ndon't want to be the same place but \nbasically if the one cell is here and \nthe other side can't be here and they \nhave some chemical attraction to each \nother and um \nyeah repulsed each other at certain \nplaces so it was very \num how do you say like high level so we \ndidn't go into into the details because \nit's already like the the uh the models \nalready complex enough so you really \nneed to think about what can you put in \nwhat's like the the minimum level of \ndetail that you need to have in there to \nto kind of simulate what's happening in \nthe experiment \num wow so you have like uh like a big \nmolecule and some kind of chemical score \nto it rather than like an atom level now \nwe did um like real like biological \ncells so \nand \num \nwe we simulate them as a as a blob and \nwe used it's called phase field approach \nso it's basically a field that's between \none and zero \nwhere it's one there is the cell where \nit's zero that's not and it goes like \nit's one one one one one and then it \ngoes down to zero in like very small \nsmall \num area and in this in this fuzzy in \nbetween phase that like it's the \nboundary of the cell \nand um then the these places from \ndifferent cells can get close to each \nother and when kind of their boundaries \ntouch you have like physical \ninteractions so they they repulse each \nother and attract each other in a \ncertain way and then um based off some \nchemicals instead of the cell you have \nadditional chemical interactions \nand then if you let them Collide you \nhave based on these interactions you \nhave then the cells behave differently \nand \nand there were like interesting \nexperiments about it and that's what we \ntry to to reproduce those experiments \nyeah well that sounds super interesting \nlike that like hierarchy of biology and \nthe um that's the whole thing is super \ninteresting well Dirk thank you so much \nfor uh describing the new performance \nchanges in we V8 version 1.15 and I \nreally enjoyed getting to learn more \nabout um you know your background and \nthe things that interest you I really \nenjoyed this podcast \nthank you very much which I did too \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate v1.15 Release with Etienne Dilocker and Dirk Kulawiak - Weaviate Podcast #24", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lyA3mf7FjY",
