{"text": "This podcast debuts a huge new release from Weaviate... the generate module! The generate module is a new API in Weaviate ... \nhey everyone this is a super special \nepisode of the wevia podcast I think \nwe've all seen the power of these large \nlanguage model Technologies like chat \ngbt and are curious about how we can use \nthis for our businesses our productivity \nfun projects and so on uh today we \nwelcome we VA CEO and co-founder Bob Van \nlight with a huge announcement about how \nwe're adding large language model \ntechnology to alleviate welcome Bob \nthanks so much Connor great to be back \non the well no we've hit podcast of \ncourse awesome so could we Dive Right \ninto how do we use it what is the new \ngenerate module yeah sure so what so as \nyou might know it so um for the \nlisteners of course that with it as a \nmodular ecosystem so you can use weak \nStandalone to add your data or your \nembeddings however you can also use \nmodules and the first wave of modules \nthat we had were factorizers right so \nyeah text to hack for example or image \nto vac from different providers \nbut when also introducing these \num generative modules so basically what \nthe generative module does is that it \ndoes something with the data in your \ndatabase and so for example if you have \na product stored in your V8 and you're \nlooking for Adidas shoes for the summer \nthen now you can also add a task or \nprompt for the model where you say Okay \npresent the results as if they were \nFacebook ads or whatever you want to do \nwith these results or summarize them all \ntogether and I think that it's super \nexciting because if we look at the \norigin right of how Vector database \neffective search engines have evolved we \nstarted to see this change that the \ninputs that we're giving as a query we \ndidn't necessarily had to make 100 match \non what was stored so for example if we \nhad stored the Eiffel Towers in Paris we \ncould locate it by searching for \nlandmarks and Friends \nbut now we're going to see the same \nthing for the output so we can actually \ndo something based on the output and \nwhat we've stored inside the database so \nI'm super excited about this and this \nwill just be a module like any other so \nyou can just hook it up to Evite and \npress button and you're good to go \nyeah it's amazing I think the whole \nretrieval augmented language model space \nis just so exciting I at first can wear \nthis idea with like retrieval augmented \ngeneration and then when when I first \nmet you and I saw like oh wow Vector \ndatabases they're building the whole \ndatabase part of it and seeing it \nbecause you can just update it with the \nthe new information and it's so \ninteresting to see that so uh could we \ndive into a little more on how to use it \nthe details of um so I see single result \nand grouped result uh can you talk more \nabout the design behind that yeah sure \nand then I'll can talk about a bit about \nit and then maybe it's good to just Dive \nRight into a demo because I'll just show \nalso to the you know people watching how \nit works so what we've done is this if \nyou query vpa to get a bunch of results \nright so you get like one results or \nmore results \num what you can do is we have a \nparameter that's called single results \nthat will run the prompt over every \nindividual result so for example where \nwe have these um if we have an \ne-commerce data set where we say show me \nAdidas shoes for the summer and the \nprompt would be represent them as \nFacebook ads \nfor this first product this would be the \nFacebook ad for the second product that \nwould be the Facebook ad Etc \nor we can give it a task for all for the \ngrouped results so we can say for \nexample if we let's take with the \ne-commerce data set if we have reviews \nwe can say okay show me the reviews \nrelated to these Adidas shoes that \npeople were there where during the \nsummer \nbut summarize them into one \num uh you know make one summarization \nfor all of these reviews so that's the \ndifference between single results or the \nindividual ones or grouped results where \nwe all capture them together \num shall we dive into the demo yeah \nlet's do it so let's use our news \narticle data set so first let's look at \nthe titles and summaries that we have \nstored in this webiate \nand now let's do a hybrid search \nso I'm going to go for a hybrid and then \nwe're gonna go for the query Italian \ncuisine \nand we'll just limit that to the first \nresult because it makes it a little bit \nmore easy to read \nso this is pure hybrid search but what \nwe now can do is that we can send the \nresults to the generative model so let's \nfirst start with single results that \nbasically means it will send every \nresult with a prompt to the model \nso we say single result \nwe give it a prompt \nso for example let's go for \num summarize the following in a tweet \nand now we need to set the property as \nwell so we only want to send the summary \nof the article \nand here you see the single result now \ncontains a tweet based on the summary of \nthis article \nlet's try something else \nso we could say create a Facebook ad \nabout the following and let's do that \nfor a meet up in a Meetup in Amsterdam \nso we still also send through the \nsummary and here you see we have a \nsingle result for a Meetup in Amsterdam \nor we can even do something like \ntranslate the following into well Dutch \nbecause the event is in Amsterdam \nso now we get back the results from the \nmodel and as you can see there are in \nDutch well if you read Dutch as I do \nor we could do something like explain \nthe historic element \nof the following to a five-year-old \nnow note how it still Returns the actual \narticle it does the hybrid search but it \nthen also sends it to in this case the \nGPT model to produce whatever prompt \nwe've given it we can also do that for \nfull results so let's look at the \nPublications we have in we V8 so we have \na bunch of news Publications and we can \ndo a pure Vector search for example \nsearching for magazines or newspapers \nabout Finance \nand let's \num set a certainty to 75 percent \nand then we get three results like the \nfinancial times the Wall Street Journal \nand the New York Times company \nwhat we can do is that we can also \ngenerate a result based on all the \nresults in one so what we're going to do \nwe're gonna go for a grouped result \nand the grouped result is not getting a \nprompt but it's getting a task we wanted \nto do something with all these results \ncombined so let's say \nexplain why these \nmagazines or newspapers are about \nfashion uh Finance \nso you see the financial times mostly \nJournal as I said are all about Finance \nbecause so it gives a explanation \nso that was the demo with the single \nresults and the group results for the \ngenerative module this was the demo in \ngraphql but of course you can also use \nit directly in Python in JavaScript Java \ngo whatever your favorite language is \nso uh what do you think yeah I mean it's \nso incredible just like the ability to \nsummarize articles has come such a long \nway I always thought that was such an \nambitious task of deep learning this \nidea that you could summarize a whole \narticle but and then also Now \nsummarizing search results so you take \nthe top five and you put them all as \ninput into the gbt thing and it's just \ncrazy I think maybe I have a little \nstory to tell like um one of the earlier \nsoftware projects I was working on it is \nlike this idea of building a travel \nitinerary so you know you travel and \nyou're saying oh I'm going to Miami what \nshould I do in Miami and this idea that \nmaybe you search for like landmarks in \nMiami you get the top five and then like \nin addition to the content where it's \nlike oh I don't remember Miami to I \nthink it's like bisque in Bay uh Lincoln \nhotels right stuff like this and like in \naddition to like the description you \nalso have the data from weviate like the \nlocation where it is and it can use that \nto sync up an itinerary that kind of \nthing so maybe the next topic we can \ntalk about is the templating like using \nmore than one data property from weviate \nthat describes each class to pass to \nchat gbt so if I'm using the weba \npodcast I could say speaker said content \non date and I can template the results \nto hand it to chat gbt that way yeah \nthat is a that is a great point and so \nwhat's what's exciting about this is \nthat so basically as you've seen in the \ndemo what we're doing is that we're \ntelling in the prompt \nthese are the properties coming from \nwebsite that you need to base your \nresult on but because of course if we \nwouldn't use you know the the that in \nour templates the properties in our \ntemplates if we just send an empty \nrequest to the model we don't want that \nbut \num \nwhat we of course aim to do here is to \nbasically more focus on the language \nunderstanding of the model than per se \non the the knowledge that it has so \num not to go too deep into the whole \nhallucination thing about this more but \nit's interesting here is that we can say \nyou must base your answer based on this \ninformation that we're giving you from \nthe database \nand if you can't you know find an answer \nor produce an answer based on what we \ngive you tell us that you can't and I \nthink that is very um that is actually \nvery exciting because here we you know \ntry to take these first steps in trying \nto solve that problem of like how do we \nmake sure that the model is giving us \num an answer that is like not \nhallucinated and that's actually true \nbased on the data \num uh that we that we have and an \nexample that I often use and there was \none example that I tried out this very \nsimple example is that if you ask the \nmodel like where's the big then right so \nit's like it's in London but if you \nstore in in vv8 in data object that says \num the the big band was in London but \nit's moved to Paris by truck or by boat \nyeah that's both I guess by both by both \nso then \num if you don't store it and then you \nask at the beginning of the input and \nwe've hit okay the query where's the big \npen then it will find the data object \nthat states that the big band originally \nwas in London but it's moved to Paris \nand that information is fed into the \nmodel and now you tell the model you \nmust answer based on what's in that data \nobject and then the model might produce \nsomething like hey it was you know \npreviously in London but now it is in \nParis and that is how we try to solve \nthat problem \num of hallucination I'm looking forward \nalso to what people will be building and \ntemplates that people will be creating \nbecause \num probably a lot to learn \num but that's you know that that's where \nwe are right now and the the first \nresults are just well as you've seen in \nthe demo are just super exciting \nyeah super interesting and I'm really \nexcited to come back to that kind of uh \nthe prompting it to ground its results \nwhere you say like these little subtle \ndetails of like when you template it \nlike please based on the search results \nor tell us if you don't know site which \nsearch results are the most relevant but \none other investigation this template \nthing that I thought was so interesting \nis that it can kind of read the Json \nKeys like when you have a Json \ndictionary that you hand off from \nweeviate to charge EBT usually the \nsemantic keys are are pretty good \ncompared but then you also with the \ntemplate you have these like little \nlanguage biases like again like speaker \nsaid content on date like that little \nsaid and on provide like a little more \nsemantic Clues than the key value naming \nmaybe we could talk a little more about \nthat just ability to read Json data and \nI think you also touched on it but the \nability to Output Json data like that \nyes so so I think first before diving is \nlike also a little story from my side I \nthe I I also tweeted about this that \num the first time that I used such a \nmodel which was somewhere you know \num I mean the first time I used such a \nmodel was like quite some time ago \nbecause she had like a good letter from \nMicrosoft but it was like you know it \nwas okay-ish but now it becomes like \nreally good so uh when I when I dove \nback into it again \nthe this thing that you're just \ncommunicating with it in natural \nlanguage and that you automatically \nstart to use words like please Etc is \nis something that I just that's such a \nparadigm shift and in my in my mind so \nthat is something that I'm just \num yeah that is something I'm super you \nknow excited about to see how that will \num uh develop and then on top of that \nwhat you just mentioned is um indeed the \nfact that uh we the first experiment \nthat I did myself was that I just gave \nit a prompt that I said you're gonna \nreceive adjacent objects from a factor \ndatabase called leviate and we're \nlooking for X Y or Z and then just just \ncopy paste it in to Json like literally \nthe Json object that comes back \nand it just parsed it and that worked \nand I was like whoa and then I was like \nso what if I go to the take a Next Step \nhere what if I say like okay \nI'm searching for something and I want \nto get a result from you and you need to \nrepresent it in this Json object \nand the result should be in the key \nresult \nbut I also created a key action where I \nsaid like okay if you want to keep \nsearching you should populate the field \naction with a search \nand where this is working as well so now \nI was like this is super exciting so the \nthing that we can start to to to do uh \nConor and this is really early days but \nwe're creating these feedback loops back \ninto the into the database so to make \nthat very concrete \num if I store products in with yet right \nand I use a vectorizer so or I bring my \nown vectors doesn't matter right so I \nhave these vectors stored in new event \nnow if it's for example products and I \nsaid okay show me all products related \nto the summer and or to the beach and \ncreate represent much Facebook ads then \nI get that as an output but I could \nchoose to just feed that back into the \ndatabase and store them now other than \nthe class I don't know ads or something \ncreate Factory presentations for those \nand now we see that the database starts \nto populate itself with relevant \ninformation but also think about you \nknow asking it questions so if somebody \nwrites a very long review for your \nproduct you just automatically feedback \nokay summarize this review \nor those kind of things there's just so \nmuch exciting stuff that we that we see \nhappening \num or we can say well I'm we're going to \nsearch for \num uh uh Sports Products for the summer \nbut group them by different sports and \nfeed them back so there's so much stuff \nthat we can start to do there and the \nfirst step in this is releasing that \ngenerative model but then of course the \nnext step is like that we start to \ncreate these feedback loops and \nthat's just yeah I've never I've never \nseen that before like coming from a \ndatabase right so that it really becomes \ngenerative itself so that's just you \nknow super exciting yeah I think that's \nlike the the mind-blowing where we're \nheaded just hard to even wrap your head \naround and I think there's kind of like \ntwo things like the ability of it to \nOutput Json data to format its output in \na particular kind of syntax whether it's \nyou know write a list of topics and \nseparate each one with an asterisk such \nthat when I'm in Python I can do you \nknow dot split asterisks and now I have \nthe list and things like this but that I \ncan write the Json that it can format \nits output in an API compatible way to \nsend it to the next thing and then just \nkeep the loop going is unbelievable and \nso I want to come back to this kind of \nour follow-up questions needed multi-hop \ndecomposition a little later but for now \nI want to stay on this idea of writing \ndata back to Eva you you call Chad gbt \nor whichever large language model and it \ngenerates something and it writes back \nto wevia and also could be like the \nimage models and the video models as \nthis space emerges but it writes it back \nto leviate and how how do you see these \nthis kind of play evolving like Can Can \nit have these like billion scale \nconversations with itself where because \nalso a huge thing of deviated is like \nthe scaling of it and like storing like \nhundreds of millions of these or \nbillions even of these conversations it \nhas itself and just exploding this kind \nof latent space of the conversation it \nhas with with itself \nuh so I mean this is just because this \nis as you said this is so new what we \nwill see happening is just I I don't \nknow yet but if I just you know um have \nmy imagination going right so for \nexample one of the things that we one of \nthe things that we could think about is \nfor example let's say let's change um \nuse cases right let's say that I'm \nstoring uh documents or web pages or \nthose kind of things on on that large \nscale that you mentioned and let's say \nthat we want to give it some something \nadditional to rank it right to say okay \nhow important is this today as opposed \nto something else \nwe could tell the model we can say like \nokay today maybe it's you know a \nspecific \nSports match is important so if you see \nstuff that's somehow related to that \nadd to the ranking if you just go \nthrough it so you keep pumping in the \ndata the model just starts to randomly \nsearch for things that might be relevant \nit might create its own semantic search \nqueries and those kind of things and \njust you know improve the results after \ntheir edit without human intervention \nthose kind of things I could really see \nhappening what you said about like \neverything multi-model the same thing \nthere because we're now very much \nfocusing on text right text is the big \nuse case most people are using it for \ntext but what do you think about like \nimages audio those kind of things \nespecially when we get these multi-model \nSolutions I just imagine that you have a \num based on what you've stored you're \nnot generating Texas output but like \nimages output you feed that back into \nthe database create a factory \npresentation for that \netc etc so \num we just we're scratching the service \nhere and you know we we of course you \nknow work closely together with those \nbuilding these these models so that we \ncan make sure the infrastructure to \nsupport it and to scale it is is there \nso it's a you know it's a beautiful \nsanity but it's just it we're just \ngetting started with this and so coming \nback to the our follow-up questions \nneeded prompt and when you when you you \ncould give it a question and then it \ncould say uh you know it broke it has \nsub question question and so it can \nstore its path of sub question asking in \nweaviate and then you can kind of trace \nit back maybe maybe we could imagine a \nfuture where you leave this running \novernight and it's like you wake up and \nit has this like massive yeah so so with \nthis kind of thing of our follow-up \nquestions needed it's this topic of like \nmulti-hop question answering where I'd \nsay uh like did uh did Thomas Edison use \na laptop questions like this where you \nfirst say when was when did Thomas \nEdison live when were laptops invented \nthis kind of multi-hop question \nanswering uh can you talk a little more \nabout the thinking on this kind of like \nrecursive our follow-up questions needed \nyeah so I think the the \num the most important thing when it \ncomes to that also in relation to to \nwhat we're doing from a database \nperspective \nis that what we see Happening Now mostly \nhappens inside the model \nso it bases that on what's in the models \nwe take the model and we just you know \nwe go through it and I I think what we \nmight talk about is you know later as \nwell as soon approaches \nwhat we're doing with the database is \nthat we're basically going to say we \nstill want to you have the power of the \nmodel of the language understanding what \nwe're seeing So based on the question \nfor example that you're asking \num but we want to feed it with real-time \ndata right and here the fact that it's \neffective search and you're affected EB \nhelps because the input is uh um you \nknow it's a semantic search you know \nquestion so it's not a traditional \nkeyword based question so that's going \nto be very very powerful so what we want \nto do is so for example the question \nthat you asked about like um was handed \nEdison use a laptop that is something \nthat can probably be reasoned from the \nmodel itself but let's say that you have \na database with you know I don't know \ncontracts from your comp and you purely \nas the model \num did we agree on the contract to do X \nthe model doesn't know \nbut what we can tell the model is okay \njust try to find that in the database so \nyou start you input that query in the \ndatabase it feeds that into the model \nthis is the data we have this is the \nquestion that we try to answer and then \nit produces an outcome or it says like \nsearch again so that's that feedback \nloop where we are today with the \ngenerative model is just it feeds it in \nthe model and it generates an output but \nthat's just no reason why we can't you \nknow \num start to to Loop that back into the \nmodel as well and that can happen from \nthe from the wave hit module but we can \nalso do that with you know new projects \nthat now you know come into existence \nthat we can use and leverage and \ncollaborate with as well so I'm super \nexcited about that yeah I'm so happy you \nbrought it back to that topic of the \nspecific data and adapting Chachi bt2 or \nwhichever large language model \ntechnology so your particular data \nbecause like it inspires things like you \nknow say we want to use we want to try \nto better understand the weviate code \nbase and this kind of thing that you \nknow the language language model \nprobably hasn't been trained directly on \nthat data but you can supplement it to \nkind of do this custom data reasoning so \nmaybe it's a big topic here but with \nthat kind of thinking how are you \nthinking about uh fine-tuning language \nmodels or is it just like do you need to \nfine-tune the language models anymore in \nyour domain or do you think this just \nkind of retrieval augmented with these \nprompts and this decomposition of how \nyou maybe you know parse the first five \nsearch results and the next five are \nlike all these different kinds of ideas \ndo you think fine-tuning the language \nmodels is going to be a big thing in the \nfuture \nyeah so this is this is super \ninteresting right so the \num because the the thing is this like \nbasically we see like uh two camps in \nthis and then we see that from a \ndifferent perspective from uh the \nacademic perspective from the product \nperspective from the engineering \nperspective from the design perspective \nso \nyou know multi-dimensional ways of \nlooking at this uh uh at this but I in \nmy role also in the company I try to sit \na little bit in the middle and and what \nI'm what I'm hoping for and but I think \nwhat I'm seeing is that on one hand you \nhave this group saying like Okay we need \nto just fine tune the model \nto get the better results \non the other hand say like no no we're \nnot going to do that we're just going to \nuse the model it's like these models are \nnot good enough to be very sophisticated \nin parsing and understanding language \nwe're just going to feed the information \nand the upside of that is that well you \ndo not have to find you now where that \nbecomes very interesting is that for \nexample if you take the pure academic \nperspective so and you have to Pure \num uh at the benchmarks and and what you \nknow and what we see being tagged as \nstate of the art and those kind of \nthings I very much understand and I \nwould also predict that fine-tuning it \nand then feeding it information will \nyield the best results right that that \njust you know basically intuition makes \nmore sense and and that will happen and \nwe'll see a lot of innovation there but \nif you look at a product perspective or \nlike a product slash \nengineering maybe even or maybe more \ndesign and product perspective \ninteresting how about wait a second if \nthe large language model is \ngood enough in parsing my question and \nbased on that present the right results \nwhy would we go to the effort of extra \nfine-tuning the model because especially \nif we have data streaming in with it \nright so one of the previous podcasts \nwas about the spark connector we're \ntalking about \nyou know uh we're not talking about like \nhundreds but thousands of like uh \ndocuments per second shooting in in fact \nthey're shooting in so and that is \nsomething of course that we \num uh you know that that is something \nthat we how should I say \num we need to somehow optimize for all \nthese different uh uh cases it's a \nlittle bit the same as sometimes \ndiscussions that you see around like how \nmany dimensions should an embedding have \nto be \nyou know good or like good enough and \nthen sometimes the answer comes from \nAcademia is different that comes from \nproduct or from engineering and somehow \nsomewhere in the middle sits that sweet \nspot and and so to recap I think that \nbased on these on these two things I \nthink that the um it will be a little \nbit more top heavy on the right hand \nside where we say do we really need to \nfind you or that we get these llms like \nthis llm is good at Medical Data this \nllm is good at engineering data \nyeah and then even if you have custom \nlanguage custom nomenclature in your in \nyour data set it will be good enough to \nparse that and get that feedback cycle \ngoing \nyeah it's incredibly interesting I agree \ncompletely with that like the the \nability to have like a local memory and \nlike cleverly manipulate the memory with \ntools like weeviate it makes a lot of \nsense compared to the fine tune on your \ncustom data but then I also see that \nspace emerging with like uh you know \nlike the legal large language model the \nPubMed one like the the different \nspecializations but still like a \nfoundation model idea where it's this \nbig model that probably hasn't seen your \nparticular data but it seemed like kind \nof like like if you're an engineer it \nseemed like engineering data generally \nso maybe this is a good transition kind \nof as we talk about the models kind of \nlike what like right now the first \niteration of the generating module is \nintegrating with the open AI models how \ndo you see that space emerging with say \nthe cohere models the Google open \nsourcing the flan T5 model seems like \nthat's something that's like on the cusp \nof it so what how do you see this space \nof the model providers playing out yeah \nthis is so this is super interesting \nright because the um I think \num our our friends at open AI did an \namazing job also in in positioning the \nmodel and because it just the the the I \nbelieve it's a DaVinci 2 model in \num but using just as a layer on top the \nuh the the the the the chat \nfunctionality right and and this here \nand this is what I find super \ninteresting right so we have in this one \ncorner we have the the academic side of \nthings but on the other end of the \nproduct side of things and they just did \na great job there because they I was \nliterally the other day I was in a bar \nand and and I explained to the bartender \nwhat I you know what it is like oh is it \nsome kind you know related and I mean \nthat's a good sign right so \num so they did something great there but \nthe point that I want to want to make \nwith this is like we do not only have \nthat model from open Ai and so we see \nwhat Google is doing indeed with flan \nwhich is super interesting because they \ndecided to open source that so that \nmeans that certain people who just for \nwhatever reason want to use a model that \nthey can control themselves \num that becomes available to them but we \nalso see indeed authors who create \ngenerated modules right so for example \nlike over here and what we do with all \nthese models um within VCA design we \nwant to support everybody so we just \nlike we just it's up to the users and \nthe customers who decide what they what \nthey want and what they need for their \nuse case we're just going to make as \nmany as we can available so that people \ncan just decide what they want and what \nI would guess is that if we take this \nout of the realm of Academia more into \nproduct and engineering and design \nit is \num \ndifferent people have different use \ncases have different needs right the \nsize of the marbles can play a role West \nhosted can play a role how you can \ncontrol the model might play role and \nthe fact that we have this wide variety \nof you know flavors and choices and what \nkind of generative model we want to use \nSame by the way goes from models we use \nto create embeddings I think that's a \nbeautiful thing so then people can \ndecide you know whatever they want and \nand again we try to support as many as \nwe can \nyou know with your expertise in business \nand product development this is a kind \nof open-ended question but do you think \nlike the cost of large language model \ninference will Trend to be extremely \ncheap over time so \nit well it has to right so there's \nalways this there's this there's this \ntrade-off right so for example \num uh let's take the example of \num \nusing your own embedding from hugging \nface versus and hosted embedding let's \nsay that your use case for your use case \nyou're fine \nusing a hosted embedding somewhere then \nthere's this trade-off point right so if \nI run it myself I have that control but \nthat comes with certain costs I need to \npay for the gpus for the infrastructure \nthose kind of things \nor it might tilt off like it became so \ncheap to run that somewhere else so we \nsaw like of course these prices they're \njust going down down down down and it \nbecomes super cheaper and cheaper to \nactually use these models so that it \nmight tip over for your use case if you \nsay okay now it's just cheap enough \nright so it's just it's the it comes \nwith that ux inflection point and \num that will really really really depend \non the use cases that you have because \nif you're in hospital \nand your store and patient files and you \nwant to quickly search through these \npatient files then \nit it can get as cheap as you want right \nso but it will not tip over it will you \nknow stick to that other side and then \nmaybe ways that people scale these \nmodels and work with them and how um \nCloud providers interact with them might \nbe more interesting for those kind of \nuse cases so there's always this \ninflection point that has a combination \nof price and you ux you know so if it's \num if the ux becomes if it's so easy for \nus it's so difficult to run one of the \nother it might just dip over or it \nbecomes so cheap then it might tip over \nbut sometimes it never tips off it's \nlike sorry we just need to do it the \nhard way because that is for our use \ncase important and that is why we also \nsee \num uh companies like I don't know like \nlike Ray or something right you know we \nhelp you run these models which is you \nknow great because there will be enough \nuse cases I mean there will be so many \nuse cases in the world that there's like \nenough for both worlds and also I think \nthese embedding providers \num they struggle of course with the fact \nthat they somehow need to scale the \neffort of running these these models and \num and but that's how it's that's how \nit's solves right so that's like the \nmarket just determines if it goes left \nor or right and that is the big \ndifference between that academic side \nand the product side so that's what I \nmean when I say like good enough \nso I was like okay you know maybe on \nbenchmarks XYZ in this \narticle it says that a works better than \nb but B is so much easier to run and so \ncheap and I get the results I want so \nwhy not go for B and that is just that's \njust age-old wisdom coming from the \nmarket you know how it could operate so \num well I hope that answers your \nquestion oh yes this is models yeah \nincredible I think that argument plays a \nlot into the like the fine-tuning \ndiscussion of earlier like right now \nit's I think like open AI coher they \noffer a fine-tuning option and it's sort \nof like you give them your data I \nhaven't used it myself so I can't speak \nfrom experience but I think the model is \nlike you give them your data they fine \ntune the model then you just pay a \nlittle more for inference compared to \nwhere like for you to fine-tune flan T5 \non your data where you might need to \ndeal with like distributed GPU training \nfor most people it might just that tip \nthat scale might just be like that's too \nmuch effort I can't be bothered with \nthis a minute and then on the other end \nis the the inference side which is \nanother extremely interesting part of it \nand yeah like like you need to host say \nlike a 4 GPU inference for your very \nlarge model and so I think this is a \ngood transition also to talk a little \nmore about the weavate module system and \nhow it helps you host the model so \nthere's two options where you can use \nthe open AI or the cohere models and \nthere's also the kind of do-it-yourself \nin wevia you have the module can you \ndescribe kind of the web module system a \nlittle more \nyeah so I can and and let me before I do \nit let me explain a bit where it's \ncoming from right so why why we have \nthis so \num if you if you have to just weave yet \nas just a um a database that you can use \nto store data objects with in fact I \nembeddings attached to it \num we've seen like people need to get \nthese embeddings from somewhere \nright and I'm a big believer in the \num the innovators early adopters uh \nearly majority kind of you know that \nthat's used in the in in crossing the \nchasm that model \nright and what we see is that these \ninnovators these what these folks have \nin common you also find them on Twitter \nthey're smart right they know how this \nstuff works they know how to operate it \nthey know how to get these ampedics and \nthose kind of things \nbut there are also people that you might \nfind when you talk at a conference when \nwe do alleviate meetups or they have you \nthey go like hey this is amazing but I \ndon't know how to run such a model \nthat's just maybe a little bit too \ncomplex or those kind of things so \nthat's where the modular ecosystem \num that's where that idea came from that \nwe say like what if we just make it \neasier for people that if they want they \ncan pick a module they don't have to \nthey can that for example takes care of \nfactorization or that takes care of \nanything else like for example \ndegenerative \nmodule you don't have to use it but you \ncan use it if you want and how it works \nis actually pretty simple so \nwe've hit itself so the database that \nwe've had database is 100 Standalone so \nif you just run the database you will \nsee that you just run one container at \nthe least right and of course scale it \nup that you know can become more \ncontainers but just for the sake of \nargument choose one container that we \ncreate that's the thing that you find \nout get up that's completely standalone \nand then you can say I enable a module \nand sometimes the modules are built in \ninto Wi-Fi so for example when you \ninteract with the openai endpoints with \nthe cohere endpoints vpa takes care of \nthrottling and those kind of things and \nhandling the errors Etc so that it \ndoesn't do one request after the other \nbut multiple ones Etc but sometimes \nmodules are a little bit more complex so \nfor example if you want to use the \nmodules from uh hugging face and you \nwant to run them yourself then you see \nthat the second container will pop up \none containing the model and inside the \nVivid module \nfor gpuf to GPU if you like and then we \nfit next to it so it did it just that it \nruns um next to each other and the idea \nagain there is very simple just to make \nit as easy as possible for people to \nwork with these models because not \neverybody knows how to do that and the \nupside of running a model as opposed to \na database is that the model is \nstateless so you just if you just one \nmore and faster you just have like a lot \nof models running parallel the problem \nis that that's crazy expensive right \nit's really really expensive \num so helping people solve those kind of \nthings that is what we aim to achieve \nwith these um with these modules so you \nsee this database in the center and then \nthis collection of modules around it \nthat you can use if you want but you \ndon't have to \num \nuh it is brilliant I yeah it's so \nexciting the web module system I think \nit adds so much to the vector database \nyou have of course like the hsw product \nquantization the approximate nearest \nneighbor part and you know the as we're \nadding the hybrid search with the bm25 \nindexing and then all the database \nfunctionality like replication you have \nall that but then you also want to have \nlike the things you're going to need to \nuse it and I think the example in \naddition to the generate module D like \nthe vectorizers is a really great \nexample like when you have a query \ncoming in you need to vectorize it to \naccess the vector index and use it and \nyeah it's just it's so interesting \nhearing about that module system in the \ndesign uh that one other thing you \nmentioned was about the container design \nand I think that is just brilliant \nengineering maybe a little biased in \nsaying that because \nbut I really find that to be so \nbrilliant like your weeviate instance \ncould have a billion data objects and it \nneeds to be this big computer but then \nyour text vectorizer is just like a \nsmaller thing because it's just \nvectorizing the queries and it all \ndepends on like the trade-offs of the \nuse cases and this kind of scaling out \nof different containers I think it's \nsuch a massive part that it adds to the \nsearch experience particularly and I \nthink as we've it evolves and the whole \nAI first databases this separation is so \ninteresting so now another topic that I \nthink is extremely exciting is so we've \ntalked to the web module system is like \nwhat should live and weviate how can it \nlive in weeviate and interact with that \nVector index but now let's kind of talk \nabout some of these large language model \norchestration tools this kind of \ncategory of \nyes yeah exactly that large language \nfunnel orchestration so uh so things \nlike Lang chain gbt index they kind of \nhave and I think it's similar to this \nearlier thing about neural search \nFrameworks like as we saw Gina Ai and \nHaystack I think it's a similar kind of \nconversation so how are you thinking \nabout this kind of topic \nyeah so I'm I'm super excited about it \nbecause I remember I think I'm not sure \nbut I think I saw \nactually I saw GPT index before Lang \nChang I think and then and I believe the \nGP index uses bank change so I was like \nI saw that first and then uh the second \none and that was just that made \nimmediate sense to me so I also \ninternally you know I said like as you \nknow of course like you know we need to \nhelp these people because it's going to \nbe awesome if you also integrate this \nwith the database and \num it this just makes sense right so \nthis has to do this might be a nice \npiece of the puzzle which feeding that \ndata back into for example the database \nwhere you ask basic basically such an \norchestration to like can you help me to \nfigure out if I should add something to \nthe database do I need to get something \nfrom the database and those kind of \nthings and \nmostly we see that currently these \norchestration tools work only with the \nmodel so what we discussed earlier there \nsaid get something fundamental but it \nwould be of course amazing and that's \nsomething we already see happening \nbecause we see the alleviate integration \nwith these tools right then we can say \nokay we now can integrate \num \num the database as well that you can see \nlike as the model do you know this or \nshould I get it from the database or you \nmight be at some point you can \norchestrate it to say like \nyou know it must come from database \nfirst and then reason over it right so \nwe can all these all these directions \nand we need orchestration for that so \nthat makes just that makes a lot of \nsense and again so we are in the \nbusiness of uh you know building a \ndatabase technology to to to to scale \nworking with your which are you know \nyour embeddings and your data objects \ntogether and then everything that we can \nwork together with and adopt the uh the \nthe Frameworks you mentioned the \num orchestration tools you mentioned the \nembedding providers that you mentioned \nEtc that is amazing it's like a new \necosystem that's starting to emerge and \nI mean I wrote a year ago maybe less \nthan a year ago I wrote an article about \nthis ecosystem I call it the AI first \necosystem and uh and yes we can debate \nabout mlai the terminology but I just \nwanted to address a broader group of \npeople right and \num and that's now missing something the \norchestration is not not in there so \nthat then you see how quickly that is \nlike evolving and makes so much sense so \na long story short I'm excited about it \nthe reason I'm excited about is because \nI think it will help in creating these \nfeedback loops and those kind of things \nyeah the feedback loop thing I think is \nreally well designed with Lang chain and \nI think because link chain and GPT \nindexes I understand them are two \nslightly different ideas as well as \nhaving a bit of overlapping \nfunctionality but yeah another thing \nabout Langston that excites me so much \nwith the wevia database is like asking \nthe language model okay you have these \nclasses like let's say I I'm creating a \nknowledge base of all my weeviate \ninformation I have the weeviate \ndocumentation I have the weba podcast I \nhave the blogs and like I just have like \nstack Overflow questions so on and so I \nsay like how do you want to just what do \nyou want to search through and then \nmaybe you can pick the class it can add \nwear filters like uh like here are some \nof the guests on the Louis vuit podcast \nwhich one do you want to search through \nI think that kind of orchestration of \nthe Wii V8 uh how to search through the \nweviate is an extremely interesting \nthing as well uh yeah so maybe uh I \nthink that's kind of a good topic a good \ncovering of these kind of orchestration \ntools and I will get more into that \nlater on with our content and uh so \nmaybe it's kind of wrapping up the \npodcast and I think even it's a very \nopen-ended question and even just a \nsummary of the topics I think would be a \ngreat answer but like this kind of \nopen-ended question of like what is the \nfuture of the wev8 generate module and \nhow are you thinking about this \nyeah so what I'm really excited about \nand this is something that I I just it's \nso funny right so if you if you see it \nthat you have like this huge Epiphany \nthat I've always been thinking about \nworking with these models on input right \nso that they can be that resolve the \nproblem of just not having a hundred \npercent keyword based search but then we \ncan \num that we can have semantic questions \nthat we can kind of do image search and \nthose kind of things that was like I saw \nthis beautiful uniqueness coming from a \nvector search engine or effective \ndatabase \nbut what we added to that is that not \nonly the input in the database but also \nthe output so they were basically saying \nlike we're going to give you relevant \ninformation coming from the database \num but that's not per se stored inside \nthe database just that's that's new I \nmean it's like I just just think about \nlike one of the most used databases in \nthe world right so like postgres or \nMySQL those kind of databases right \nit only outputs \nwhat's in there right which makes sense \nbecause let's use it but now we have \nthis thing working you can do that if \nyou want that's fine you can do that but \nalso it can give you information give \nyour data that's generated based on a \ntask or prompt that you're giving it and \nhaving databases that take this \ninformation make sense of it on input \ntime and generate relevant new content \nif that's something you want as user I \nthink that's a that's that's amazing and \nthat's just getting started I mean we \nshould do this podcast like a half a \nyear from now again and then just see \nhow it evolved and what's happening \nthere because this is just too exciting \nman \nyeah we should have like a predictions \nthat we revisit on the podcast \nyeah well awesome thank you so much Bob \nI think yeah the search experience is \nhaving a makeover with this large \nlanguage model extension onto the end of \nit uh the whole discussion of the \ngenerate module demo of how to use it \nthe discussion of the argument single \nresult grouped result templating and the \nprompting all these things to think \nabout and then uh think about the \nprompting like grounded generation \nprompts uh our follow-up questions \nneeded cite your sources tell me you \ndon't know and then I'm so excited about \nwriting data back to Eva the language \nmodel orchestration and the module \nsystem all this stuff so thanks so much \nBob yeah thanks for having me here \nConnor it's always great you know to \nshare with the you know the wider world \nwhat we're working on so thanks \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Bob van Luijt on Generative Search with Weaviate - Weaviate Podcast #35", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro3ln4A9N8w",
