{"text": "Learn about available authentication options (anonymous / API key authentication / OIDC authentication) in Weaviate, and key ... \nhi there in this short video we'll \nintroduce you to the fundamentals of \nauthentication in weaviate and give you \na little bit of background on what it is \nand what options are available including \na brief comparison of the options \nauthentication is the process of \nverifying a user's identity when they \ninteract with a system like waviate \nidentifying the user allows the system \nto then provide the right level of \naccess to the system's resources which \nis called authorization \nsecurity is an important factor with \nauthentication it needs to stop Bad \nactors from pretending to be someone \nelse and gaining access to resources \nthat they shouldn't have access to \nbut sometimes better security can get in \nthe way of usability Imagine a door with \n15 locks it would be more secure but \ncompletely unwieldy \nso a big part of authentication is all \nabout finding the right trade-off \nbetween security and usability \nwebia provides three different \nauthentication configurations to cater \nto different use cases and requirements \nlet's go through them one by one \nthe first is anonymous access \nthis option allows anyone to access a \nwaviate instance without any credentials \nthe second is API Keys the API key \nconfiguration requires users to provide \na key for Authentication \nif leviate recognizes a key the user \nwill then get the corresponding level of \naccess such as read-only or read and \nwrite privileges to aviate \nand the last is oidc or open ID connect \nor IDC is an Authentication Protocol \nthat's designed to allow users to sign \ninto multiple places using a single set \nof credentials \nthis is quite a secure option but it can \nbe complex as setup and use as it \nusually involves multiple parties and \nbackground processes \nfor most use cases we think that the API \nkey based authentication is the best \nchoice because it provides a balance \nbetween ease of use and security \nAPI keys are simple to set up and manage \nand they offer a good level of security \nfor most applications \nhowever it's essential to keep your API \nKeys safe as they will grant access to \nyour weeviate instance \nthat's it for our introduction to \nauthentication and weviate now you have \na basic understanding of the three \ndifferent authentication configurations \nand why API keys are often the best \nchoice for many applications \nsee you next time \n", "type": "Video",
