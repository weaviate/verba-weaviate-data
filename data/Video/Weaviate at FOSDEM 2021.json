{"text": "Update about the Weaviate Vector Search engine at FOSDEM 2021 by Bob van Luijt. \n[Music]thank you for watching this fosdem talkit's a weird year um i'm presenting toyou onlinethe the past few years i was of coursein brussels to uh to be at the actualeventbut this year online and this is thethird year thatwe've had is being presented so twoyears agowe showed with it for the first time mycolleague chen was showinghow we were working on wev8 how we werefocusing onvectorizing notes in the graphlast year it was me and you couldalready see how we've hit was turningmore intoa full-fledged search engine uh it stillhad thegraph data model but it was morestarting to focus on vector searchand this year i'm very happy to announcethat we've releasedwe've hit version one we've had versionone is a full-fledged databaseit has full crowd support and it'sfocusing on vector indexing andsearching two vectorsum it's quite new so for those whohaven't heardof this don't worry no worries i'm goingto show you and explain to you exactlywhat it does and why we think there's alot of valuepotentially for your project in using wev8so i hope you enjoyed this talk if youhave any questions don't hesitate toreach out to me on the fastlane websiteyou can all find all my contactinformation sothank you for watching um four thingsi'm going to show youthe first thing is why do you want tohave a vector search engine what's theneed of a vector databasethen i'm going to talk about what we vv8is and then i'm going to show you twodemos first avery simple demo while you just see howyou can use wev8 and you can see thethe vector search in action and then alittle bit of a biggercase based on articles where you can seehow we can quickly find insights fromthese articlesso thanks for watching and let's startwithwhy do you need a vector search engineso these vector search engines or vectordatabases they'relike a 2021 a hot topic right nowbut you might wonder why so what's sospecial about them what what is it thatthey do andi'm going to try to explain to you whatthey do um andthe easiest way to do that is go alittle bit back into historyso if you go back to the 2010s then weseethat deep learning is becoming reallyfeasibleand there's this this famous case wheremachine learning model tries torecognize if there's acat in a photo so what you basically seeis you see a photoof a cat and then the model gives anoutput with a percentagehow certain it is that there might becat in there and then you canthe juice if there's a cat or not in thephotoand you can give it another photo etcetc to do thisyou need to somehow represent the photoin a way that the machine can actuallyread it andthat's done in vectors and vectors arejust representationsin a hyperspace if you will so they looklikeyou would have coordinates in athree-dimensional space but then oftenlike 300sometimes 900 sometimes 1500 sometimeseven bigger spacesto actually represent what's in thesephotos andwhat the model does is that it looks atpatterns and based on the patterns thatit can find in the vectorit makes an estimation for example yes ithink there's a cat in this photoor no i don't think that there's a catin this photo and this is how thesemachine learning models workthey need vectors as input and theysometimes also produce vectors as outputbecause that's how the model determineswhat the pattern is and if they can findinsights in it and you can representanything as a vector that can be animage but alsotext so a lot that's happening now withnatural language processinghas to do with vectors so regardless ifit'sglove or where to vac or fast text orbird orother transformers it's always the casethat you needvectors in your model to makepredictions and determine what somethingmeansnow you might say well those are greatuse cases right i can come up with a lotof ideas so for exampleum for recognizing cats in photos youcould come up with a medical use casewhere youuse x-rays to see if somebody maybebroke bone or something and have themachine do that oryou might want to know if a text isabout a certain topicand that's all true that's all workingfine and this is working in productionand people are building great thingswith itso what if you want to know somethingabout a lot of vectorsa simple example so let's take a googlesearch queryso we go to google search and we type inwho's the ceoof tesla now you see it returnselon musk and it does it pretty quick sowe didn't search for elon we didn'tsearch for musk we somehowsearched for the relation between teslaand the function of a ceo and itreturned to elon muskand to do that it had to browse throughthousands hundred thousands maybe evenmillions of pagesso the question is like how could googledo that so fast what did they dowell they were doing basically a reversesearch onvectors and you know companies are goodat this sogoogle search does it with text appledoes it with siriibm watson does it with with medicaldatabut what if you want to build such asolution what if you have a lot oftextual or image data or audio thatthat and you want to build a solutionthat can do the same thing like thesecompanies dowell that's where the vector searchengine comes in becausethat's the problem that the vectorsearch engine solvesand we've here this vector search engineso let's talk a little bit more aboutweavieate about its inner workings andthenquickly let's go to the demo so that youactually can see it in actionso at the highest level vvate has a verysimple classproperty structure that means that youhave a data object which has aclass and then you have a property andthen you can add your dataand what it is that you're adding towev8 really doesn't matter so you canpresentnews articles financial transactionscyber security threatsscientific articles web pages legaldocuments social media posts insurancedocumentsor you could even use photos videosaudios etcwhen you now store the data in aweaviate you can store the objectthrough vectors you've created yourselfor by using one of the out-of-the-boxvectorizers the custom a nimplementation has full crowd supportmaking vvate a full-fledged databasethat you can use in productionso let's do a quick sneak peek demobased on our out of the box news articlethat i setso here you see a bunch of articles justsome random titlesand what we can now do in the factorspace is that we can say well we want tomovenear a specific concept so for examplesoftware business andlimit that to three results and here yousee astartup about blockchain serverlesscomputing and workplace technologyand now let's move away from a conceptin the vector spaceso we're going to move away from theconcept of decentralized networksand we're going to set a low force of 50there so now the blockchain businessshould movea bit down as you see we can also do theopposite so we can move to a conceptso we can say let's move to uh lenastorefalls inventionwhich is git of course and do that witha force of 90and now you see all of a suddensomething related to git and githubpops up in the end results there arealso additional features for examplelike the semantic path where you can seewhich routewe've yet took to the hyperspace fromthe query to the results on thedocumentation on the website you canfindmany more additional features andexamples on how to usewev8 thank you for watching thislightning talk i hope you like it i hopeyou're going to try with it outwe would love to hear your feedback uhif you justgoogle or duckduckgo or whatever searchengine you useand type in we've yet you will find thevector search engine we've ateon github or on our own website you canleave us messages there you can join ourslack channel you can leave questions onstack overflowwe'd love to hear what you built and ifyou have questions about use cases orwhat you can do make sure to reach outthank you bye", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate at
