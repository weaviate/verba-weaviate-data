{"text": "Update about the Weaviate Vector Search engine at FOSDEM 2021 by Bob van Luijt. \n[Music] \nthank you for watching this fosdem talk \nit's a weird year um i'm presenting to \nyou online \nthe the past few years i was of course \nin brussels to uh to be at the actual \nevent \nbut this year online and this is the \nthird year that \nwe've had is being presented so two \nyears ago \nwe showed with it for the first time my \ncolleague chen was showing \nhow we were working on wev8 how we were \nfocusing on \nvectorizing notes in the graph \nlast year it was me and you could \nalready see how we've hit was turning \nmore into \na full-fledged search engine uh it still \nhad the \ngraph data model but it was more \nstarting to focus on vector search \nand this year i'm very happy to announce \nthat we've released \nwe've hit version one we've had version \none is a full-fledged database \nit has full crowd support and it's \nfocusing on vector indexing and \nsearching two vectors \num it's quite new so for those who \nhaven't heard \nof this don't worry no worries i'm going \nto show you and explain to you exactly \nwhat it does and why we think there's a \nlot of value \npotentially for your project in using we \nv8 \nso i hope you enjoyed this talk if you \nhave any questions don't hesitate to \nreach out to me on the fastlane website \nyou can all find all my contact \ninformation so \nthank you for watching um four things \ni'm going to show you \nthe first thing is why do you want to \nhave a vector search engine what's the \nneed of a vector database \nthen i'm going to talk about what we vv8 \nis and then i'm going to show you two \ndemos first a \nvery simple demo while you just see how \nyou can use wev8 and you can see the \nthe vector search in action and then a \nlittle bit of a bigger \ncase based on articles where you can see \nhow we can quickly find insights from \nthese articles \nso thanks for watching and let's start \nwith \nwhy do you need a vector search engine \nso these vector search engines or vector \ndatabases they're \nlike a 2021 a hot topic right now \nbut you might wonder why so what's so \nspecial about them what what is it that \nthey do and \ni'm going to try to explain to you what \nthey do um and \nthe easiest way to do that is go a \nlittle bit back into history \nso if you go back to the 2010s then we \nsee \nthat deep learning is becoming really \nfeasible \nand there's this this famous case where \nmachine learning model tries to \nrecognize if there's a \ncat in a photo so what you basically see \nis you see a photo \nof a cat and then the model gives an \noutput with a percentage \nhow certain it is that there might be \ncat in there and then you can \nthe juice if there's a cat or not in the \nphoto \nand you can give it another photo etc \netc to do this \nyou need to somehow represent the photo \nin a way that the machine can actually \nread it and \nthat's done in vectors and vectors are \njust representations \nin a hyperspace if you will so they look \nlike \nyou would have coordinates in a \nthree-dimensional space but then often \nlike 300 \nsometimes 900 sometimes 1500 sometimes \neven bigger spaces \nto actually represent what's in these \nphotos and \nwhat the model does is that it looks at \npatterns and based on the patterns that \nit can find in the vector \nit makes an estimation for example yes i \nthink there's a cat in this photo \nor no i don't think that there's a cat \nin this photo and this is how these \nmachine learning models work \nthey need vectors as input and they \nsometimes also produce vectors as output \nbecause that's how the model determines \nwhat the pattern is and if they can find \ninsights in it and you can represent \nanything as a vector that can be an \nimage but also \ntext so a lot that's happening now with \nnatural language processing \nhas to do with vectors so regardless if \nit's \nglove or where to vac or fast text or \nbird or \nother transformers it's always the case \nthat you need \nvectors in your model to make \npredictions and determine what something \nmeans \nnow you might say well those are great \nuse cases right i can come up with a lot \nof ideas so for example \num for recognizing cats in photos you \ncould come up with a medical use case \nwhere you \nuse x-rays to see if somebody maybe \nbroke bone or something and have the \nmachine do that or \nyou might want to know if a text is \nabout a certain topic \nand that's all true that's all working \nfine and this is working in production \nand people are building great things \nwith it \nso what if you want to know something \nabout a lot of vectors \na simple example so let's take a google \nsearch query \nso we go to google search and we type in \nwho's the ceo \nof tesla now you see it returns \nelon musk and it does it pretty quick so \nwe didn't search for elon we didn't \nsearch for musk we somehow \nsearched for the relation between tesla \nand the function of a ceo and it \nreturned to elon musk \nand to do that it had to browse through \nthousands hundred thousands maybe even \nmillions of pages \nso the question is like how could google \ndo that so fast what did they do \nwell they were doing basically a reverse \nsearch on \nvectors and you know companies are good \nat this so \ngoogle search does it with text apple \ndoes it with siri \nibm watson does it with with medical \ndata \nbut what if you want to build such a \nsolution what if you have a lot of \ntextual or image data or audio that \nthat and you want to build a solution \nthat can do the same thing like these \ncompanies do \nwell that's where the vector search \nengine comes in because \nthat's the problem that the vector \nsearch engine solves \nand we've here this vector search engine \nso let's talk a little bit more about \nweavieate about its inner workings and \nthen \nquickly let's go to the demo so that you \nactually can see it in action \nso at the highest level vvate has a very \nsimple class \nproperty structure that means that you \nhave a data object which has a \nclass and then you have a property and \nthen you can add your data \nand what it is that you're adding to \nwev8 really doesn't matter so you can \npresent \nnews articles financial transactions \ncyber security threats \nscientific articles web pages legal \ndocuments social media posts insurance \ndocuments \nor you could even use photos videos \naudios etc \nwhen you now store the data in a \nweaviate you can store the object \nthrough vectors you've created yourself \nor by using one of the out-of-the-box \nvectorizers the custom a n \nimplementation has full crowd support \nmaking vvate a full-fledged database \nthat you can use in production \nso let's do a quick sneak peek demo \nbased on our out of the box news article \nthat i set \nso here you see a bunch of articles just \nsome random titles \nand what we can now do in the factor \nspace is that we can say well we want to \nmove \nnear a specific concept so for example \nsoftware business and \nlimit that to three results and here you \nsee a \nstartup about blockchain serverless \ncomputing and workplace technology \nand now let's move away from a concept \nin the vector space \nso we're going to move away from the \nconcept of decentralized networks \nand we're going to set a low force of 50 \nthere so now the blockchain business \nshould move \na bit down as you see we can also do the \nopposite so we can move to a concept \nso we can say let's move to uh lena \nstorefalls invention \nwhich is git of course and do that with \na force of 90 \nand now you see all of a sudden \nsomething related to git and github \npops up in the end results there are \nalso additional features for example \nlike the semantic path where you can see \nwhich route \nwe've yet took to the hyperspace from \nthe query to the results on the \ndocumentation on the website you can \nfind \nmany more additional features and \nexamples on how to use \nwev8 thank you for watching this \nlightning talk i hope you like it i hope \nyou're going to try with it out \nwe would love to hear your feedback uh \nif you just \ngoogle or duckduckgo or whatever search \nengine you use \nand type in we've yet you will find the \nvector search engine we've ate \non github or on our own website you can \nleave us messages there you can join our \nslack channel you can leave questions on \nstack overflow \nwe'd love to hear what you built and if \nyou have questions about use cases or \nwhat you can do make sure to reach out \nthank you bye \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate at FOSDEM 2021", "path": "", "link":
