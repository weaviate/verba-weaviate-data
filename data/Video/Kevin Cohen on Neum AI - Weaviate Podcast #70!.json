{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the 70th episode of the Weaviate podcast with Neum AI CTO and Co-Founder ... \nhey everyone before diving into the \npodcast I want to highlight this \nincredible article that new mayi has \npublished that'll be linked in the \ndescription of this video the blog post \nis titled retrieval augmented generation \nat scale building a distributed system \nfor synchronizing and ingesting billions \nof text embeddings this is a really \ngreat article going through all things \ndata ingestion and particularly building \nthis distributed messaging system for \ndifferent parts of this process from \nconnecting to different data sources to \nchunking and embedding it's a super \ninteresting system and I learned so much \nfrom talking with Kevin so quickly I \nwant to highlight uh this image \nparticularly because about uh 16 minutes \n16 and 1 12 minutes in the podcast we're \ngoing to reference uh this figure two in \nthe article this particular diagram \nabout uh how this messaging queue is \nstructured with uh doing different \nthings like the chunking and how you \nkind of like isolate each PDF say so \noverall this is such a nice article \nthere are so many insights about U \nthings like this celery task CU these uh \ndistributed import benchmarks and uh \nlooking at at things like the number of \nthreads per machine and just all sorts \nof interesting insights so I just I \nhighly highly highly recommend checking \nout this article and thank you so much \nfor watching this podcast where we'll \ndiscuss the things in the article but \nyeah I just wanted to make sure it's \nknown that this is linked in the \ndescription and it is just a fantastic \narticle hey everyone thank you so much \nfor watching another episode of the \nweeva podcast I'm super excited to \nwelcome Kevin Cohen the CTO and \nco-founder of n AI there's so much \nexciting things happening in the space \nof say ETL for l M or data ingestion \ninto Vector databases this whole flow of \nuh reading data connecting it to \ndifferent sources like notion geub uh \nyou know S3 buckets all these things \nthen chunking metadata extraction EMB \nbedding so this is such an exciting \nspace and I'm so excited to interview \nKevin Kevin welcome to the podcast thank \nyou Connor Thank you super excited to \nhave you to to have me here and and \nhonestly you bring this excitement that \nit uh it motivates everyone here that's \nthat's talking to to really get excited \nas well so awesome so I think kind of \nstaying on the exciting story can we get \ninto this uh you know what motivated you \nto start new Ai and how has the journey \nbeen so far yeah for sure uh this is a \nthis is a quite a long journey but I \nI'll summarize it uh me and my \nco-founder uh we're both ex Microsoft \nand uh we uh we applied to Y combinator \nuh a couple months ago and we got \naccepted with uh this idea that we had \nabout building a restaurant but uh and \nit's completely different to what we're \ndoing with neom but uh one the insights \nthat we had what we were doing this \nrestaurant bot uh playing with GPT and \nllms and and embeddings and all of these \nthings is uh the the the notion of \nsyncing the data from like Source into a \nsome sort of vector storage where you \nhave the embedding so that you could do \nretrieval augmented generation and all \nof these applications because what we \nwere doing at the very beginning was \nsort of like very naive in which if uh \nthe source data would change we would \nnot reflect that into our um embeddings \nand Vector storage and so if you would \nask a question to your to your \nrestaurant bot like do you have this \nitem on the menu the bot would answer \nyes but in fact you didn't have this \nbecause you know let's say that the \ncontext had changed from the menu and so \nwe we got this insight into hey maybe we \nshould actually focus on the tech and \nbuilding a platform that um allows \ndevelopers and people to actually make \nthese applications easier because we \nunderstand what's going on with the data \nsyncing the data pipelines the \ninfrastructure so that dat needs to \nhappen specifically for large scale and \nthat's what we decided to you know focus \non and and and the birth of NE just \nfocusing on the on the uh platform side \nof things yeah it's amazing I I \ndefinitely want to come back to kind of \nthe experience at YC combinator and I've \nseen a lot of AI companies and why \ncomary we'll come back to that but I \nwant to stay on the the restaurant \nexample uh keeping the source of data in \nsync with the vector database I'm very \ncurious in further understanding that \nbecause I understand you know we8 to be \nlike a you know it I guess there like in \ndatabases there's like olap oltp like \ntransactional processing versus \nanalytical queries so I kind of \nunderstand uh the vector database to be \nsort of like a transactional processing \nthing like your restaurant perhaps would \nbe doing crud updates directly to WEA \nversus say it has a notion template that \nit needs to keep in sync with WEA could \nmaybe expand on that point a yeah yeah \nyeah yeah yeah so um the main thing with \nrestaurants is \nthat they don't want to uh get like new \ntechnology or new things on top of what \nthey already have right so the \nrestaurant really uh is based on like \nthe point of sales system that they have \nand so there's tons of different point \nof SES systems but that that that's \npretty much what what dictates how the \ndata is stored in their systems and \ntheir databases and whatnot so if you're \nbuilding an application on top of that \nfor whatever needs you are you probably \nwant to connect to the point of sale so \nthat you can get the most upto-date \ninformation and so what we were doing \nnaively as I was telling you is that we \nwere basically getting the um connection \nto a point of sale uh let's say square \nright and we would be uh dumping \nwhatever menu items they had one time \nand we would be chunking embedding uh \nand and and putting it into into a \nvector database and we would do you know \nyour general rag application where you \nwould ask hey do you have this item for \na menu and things would work but as you \ncan tell if the point of sale system \nwould get updated because let's say they \nadded a new item or they removed an item \nor they change the price or whatever it \nis then your your your your vector \ndatabase or or or the place where your \napplication is actually pulling the data \nfrom would need to have that context \nwould need to know that something \nchanged because again the source of \nTruth is the point of sale it's not a \nnotion document is this either \ncomplicated system or easy to use like \ndepending on the point of self that you \nuse that that the restaurants have \naccess to and so you want to make sure \nthat the source and the destination \nwhich is what we like to call it are in \nsync so that if the your application is \nis is is is going and doing semantic \nsearch for example to a specific Vector \ndatabase like we then that that \ninformation needs to be sync so that the \nthat so that the the bot can respond \naccurately so that's what that that's \npretty much the Insight that we had um \nbecause we naively just started with a \nsimple basic idea and we figured well I \nmean this is definitely a problem is \nsomething like this changes every \ntime yeah you've definitely sold me on \nthe idea I think like one of the \narguments around the development of we8 \nhas been to have many different \nprogramming language clients so we has \nlike you know addition to like Python \nand JavaScript there's also like Java \nand goang and we had Andre on the \npodcast who talked about like uh Ruby \nclient for we8 and so I think that's one \nkind of argument on this like connect it \nwith how restaurants or government \ndatabase systems integrate with these \nthings but I like what you're saying a \nlot where you know you have a square \ndata like date Square operates like a \ndatabase and then you sync it with the \nvector database and I can definitely see \nthat argument so yeah so I think kind of \nDove right into the data connectors \ntopic our listeners we're doing this end \nto end of data ingestion and you I do \nthink data connectors though is just one \nof the most exciting topics because I \nthink about you know I I love thinking \nabout rag for my personal note taking \nbecause selfishly I want to be you know \nleveraging these Technologies and I feel \nlike just this idea of like connecting \nmy notion with say the we8 GitHub issues \nwith the weeva blogs with my Twitter \nfeed this kind of like syncing of the \nsources sources it sounds so powerful \ncan you tell me about just like how you \nsee the opportunity there yeah for sure \nman I mean and and and look this was \njust the restaurant example that really \nsparked our interest there but um where \nwe really want to go is um what other \napplications can actually be powered by \nthis and and how are Enterprises even \nthink about even thinking about this uh \nthis type of problem and there's there's \nbunch of people doing rag as you \nprobably know this uh and and really one \nof the key main things that we want to \ndive into is what are sort of sort of \nthe the the business requirements that \nare happening at this level of \nsynchronization because um the \nrestaurant idea is actually true and \nit's actually a problem that we faced \nbut um we want to try and also \nunderstand which is another topic that I \nhaven't touched but we will touch later \non the large scale sort of thing if you \nhave millions and millions and millions \nof of records of data or unstructured \ndata like your notion files although I \ndoubt that you have millions of notion \npages but uh it could be um so how do \nyou actually go and and and chunk those \nefficiently and extract those and embed \nthose and and we we'll talk about \nembedding scash and synchronize those \nand so really going into what are these \nlarge scale Enterprises um uh business \nrequirements that will'll go and see \nmore into in in how business are \nadopting Rag and and more of the Gen \napplications that's where we're trying \nto really focus on and and dive very \ndeep yeah that is super sold it all \nmakes a ton of sense and so I think okay \nso I think kind of this data connection \nargument is is pretty solid I don't \nthink anyone would disagree with the \nimportance for this so I think kind of \nmoving then into our kind of endtoend \ndata ingestion topic The Next Step would \nbe this kind of like chunking and \nmetadata extraction and I maybe also \nwanted to you know quickly get your \nthoughts on chunking in metadata \nextraction because I want to like I \nthink kind of well sorry I think kind of \nconnecting this with the connectors \nthing is very interesting because I \nimagine like my notion Pages for example \nthe reason I like using notion \npersonally is I love having this like \nrecursive how I can like create a page \nwithin a page kind of so having the the \nmetadata of like the title of the page I \nimagine with PDFs you the metadata is \nlike that you know if your PDF has like \na scientific paper it has like a title \nand so you trying to look for those kind \nof things I think it's such a deep topic \nso at the maybe we'll also come back to \nthis at the end of the \npodcast it's such a deep thought let let \nme just give you like the the the two \nsentences that I have on this is that \none of the things me and my co-founder \nhave been thinking about is the whole \ntopic of like extraction and chunking \nand smart pre-processing that I think uh \nyou've also heard with with other people \nthat you brought in into the podcast to \nme that is still a research topic like I \ndon't think anybody has a chunking \nmethod that works for everything that \ndoesn't exist because as you said like \nscientific paper chunking is way \ndifferent than how you chunk Json or how \nyou chunk financial documents or how you \nchunk any different things have it's \nvery um requirement and business \nspecific and so there's a bunch of \nthings that that have been tried um uh \nin the industry and we've been thinking \nabout some of these things simple things \nlike hey we can allow the user to \nspecify what metadata they want because \nthey know their context or we will do a \nbasic recursive chunking and and and \nbasic metadata extraction based on some \nfields that you were saying like title \npage number whatever okay but then you \ncan go and and I'm sure you've heard \nabout this as well about the smart chunk \nand smart metadata extraction where you \ncan maybe leverage llms or even on \nstructure which I know that they they \ncame to your podcast right and and how \ncan um you correctly or smartly assign \nmetadata and chunk based on the type of \ndata that you're having and so we've \nalso done a little bit of that over at \nneom but it's it's it's definitely such \na large uh piece and and important piece \nas well but it it it's still in its very \nearly stages in terms of like to me it's \nlike a research uh topic \nso yeah I think it's so fascinating like \nyou know learning from about like n and \nunstructured and seeing how this kind of \nMarket is developing I could almost \nimagine these categories within data \ningestion evolving further \nbecause the smart chunking thing makes \nme laugh because we were joking about \nthis at the AI conference and Eddie \nand's like we should do a blog post on \nSmart chunking and I'm like well it \ndefinitely sounds better than dumb \nchunking \nlike add smart to it \nI I don't know what we've all converged \nin industry to like smart chunking if \nyou go to Twitter everyone's like oh \nyeah smart chunker it's like okay what \ndo that what what did we have before \ndumb \nchunker that's upgrade yeah that's \nfantastic and I think kind of like \nthere's like Nils ryers who's been one \nof the biggest like early pioneers of AI \npowered searches been explaining this \nconcept of like multi- discourse how if \nyou have a paragraph that has multiple \ntopics like you know a lot of the times \nis I've been one of my favorite apps is \num is searching through this podcast and \nsomething I've noticed a lot is when \nyou're talking for a while you tend to \nchange the topic in the middle of the \ntalking and so that will cause a really \nfunky embedding so I think that's one of \nthe best opportunities for chunking is \nto extract that kind of like this is \nseparated the topic and yeah exactly and \nso so yeah I think metadata is such a \ndeep topic I may want to actually save \nthat for later let's now d uh sorry dive \ninto how you're thinking about uh \nembedding inference management yeah yeah \nthat is this is another big piece and \nand maybe at the at at the end we'll uh \num we we'll talk a little bit about like \nhow how the whole end to endend uh Works \nin terms of like the whole \ninfrastructure and and uh and talk a \nlittle bit about that but embeddings is \ndefinitely a huge piece here of course \nyou want to do semantic search you want \nto store the data in the vector DB you \nwant to have the embeddings but there's \nso many things that come into picture so \nstuff like which model you want to use \nyou want to use an open source model you \nwant to host it yourself you want to \nhost it in replicate you want to host it \nin pH you want to just use open AI all \nof these things come into play um \ndepending on the model that you choose \nyou have different dimensions in your \nvector and so people at the very \nbeginning might just go with oh let's \njust go with openi it's very easy to use \nand yeah you can use that openi has 1536 \nDimensions with their Ada Z2 that's fine \nbut when you're actually dealing with a \nscale and you want to insert all of this \ninformation in the vector database then \nthe dimensions that you choose for your \nembedding models is crucial it can save \nactually huge costs if you don't use a \nmodel that has a lot of dimensions of \ncourse if you have less dimensions then \nmaybe your accuracy is is is um not as \ngreat as the one that you have more \nDimensions so as in software engineering \nit's all a trade-off but these are all \nthe things that you need to really take \ninto consideration when when you want to \nyou know vectorize and and maintaining \nthis this source and this destination in \nin sync and the other very important \nthing for embeddings is that um you know \nif if you're building like proof of \nconcept of applications or like hobbyist \napplications where you know you have a \ncouple of documents and you want to \nextract and you want to embed and you \nwant to store it's virtually very easy \nbut if you have a large scale \ndata and you want to make sure that you \nembed and vectorize that and you put it \ninto the destination you don't want to \nre-embed everything if you already \nembedded it what I mean by that is if \nyou have you know gigabytes of data um \nthat you want to put into the into into \nyour you you want to vectorize you want \nto put into your vector database and you \nwant to run that let's say every couple \nhours or every every whatever Cadence \nyou want \num you don't want to revalorize the \nthings that didn't change so you need to \nhave some sort of like embedding scash \nand this has again you know uh Lama \nindex and L chain they've talked about \nthese things as well but how do you \nproperly determine whether something \nchanged so that then you can figure out \nif you need to do the um calculation and \nuse the compute of your model for for \nopen AI or whatever you use and then and \nthen store in Vector because chances are \nthat if the data did not change you did \nyou do not need to to to waste those \ncompute resources or and that eventually \nURS towards dollars right and so you \nneed to you need to have this concept of \nwell I want to embed and I I need to put \nit into the vector DB but I need to make \nsure that I don't do the I don't do it \nblindly uh you do it with with with um \nconscience that okay um this thing's \nchanged now I need to re-embed then I'm \ngoing to insert it insert it and so \nthat's the whole piece of like the \nembeddings management and the embeddings \ncash that we've also played around with \nso um we can essentially you know save \nthe costs to to the end user who wants \nto move the \ndata yeah so I I want I think first i' \nsay I think this is another category of \nthat kind of um you know ingestion \nkeeping the source and the destination \nin sync I love how you expl this kind of \nmotivation it's quite novel and yeah \nI've seen this before like with um \npeople who are doing like code search on \ntheir GitHub and when they do a new poll \nrequest they're saying hey should I rev \nvectorize now this function and that's \nprobably one of the big opportunities is \nlike LMS for code putting your big code \nbase into a vector DB and the \nmiscellaneous nuances that comes with \nthat but um so yeah it was kind of so I \nI do I think I want to come back to this \nkind of Park the um you know how we keep \nthe sources in sync and and learn more \nabout the embedding cache but right now \nI want to get into kind of the end to \nend flow of new that you describe in \nthis really excellent article about \nthese these three different messaging \ncues that you orchestrate you present \ncelery and how that works for having uh \nrequests process documents and embed \nstore can you maybe walk through the \narchitecture of how you have these \ndifferent distributed messaging cues \nyeah yeah for sure for sure maybe maybe \nit helps if people can see like the the \ndiagram and the picture that that we \nhave in that in that blog post where \nwhere where they can see how have \neverything uh links to but I'm you can \nput like a link to that um but look at \nthe core of at the core of it Connor is \nreally just a distributed system uh and \nin this case it's a rag pipeline that \nyou need to do embeddings and store sure \nbut at the very core is the problem of \nan engineering distributed system where \nyou have lots of data you need to be \nable to do retry logic you need to be \nable to do parallelization you need to \nbe able to do resource compute \nmanagement and you need to be calling \nsome API some different providers you \nneed to use some CPU some compute um and \nthen you know whatever end to end thing \nyou want to do which in this case is \nchunk read um uh embed and then \nvectorize uh that's your end to end but \nuh at the core of it is this distributed \nsystem and this is pretty much what me \nand my cofounder have had experience \nwith in the past uh in Microsoft and \nwhatnot uh on building data \ninfrastructure and data pipelines and \ndata platform for distributed systems \nand so um what what we ended up saying \nis well what are the three main things \nthat we need to do in order for for \ndoing this rack Pipeline and and we \nseparated it in and as you as you saw on \nthe blog post into like three main \ntopics which is there's a request that \ncomes in um into our service uh where \nthat request is going to be um quickly \nprocessed and figure out like which \nsource this request is from for example \nS3 in in the case that we talked to the \nblog and then um we want to return to \nthe user right away saying hey we \nreceived your request we're working on \nit because it's it's an a sync operation \nof course it's something that takes time \nand so then that um from from that spec \nfrom from that first step we go and we \nwe we enter into the our distributed \ncues so that we can process multiple of \nthese requests of course uh and and we \nsend them to our next step which is hey \nnow I'm going to be now that I know it's \nS3 and I have this many files then I \nwant to process each of these files \nagain naively you you don't need to \nbuild the distributed system if you \ndon't want and you just Loop through \neverything and you process everything \nand like it's going to take an eternity \nand not a very efficient thing right so \nthat's why you want to enter this \ndistributed cue messaging uh distributed \ndistributed message cues um and and you \nwant to be able to paralyze and so hey \nnow you are at the file level that you \nwant to process for example in this \nspecific X S3 example and so okay now \nI'm going to process each of the files \neach file might need to do some chunking \nin and of itself and so now you need to \nprocess each file each chunk and now you \nmaybe want to say okay now I have each \nof these chunks of this file I'm going \nto send them to another processor again \nso that you can parallelize and and \ndistribute the the the different tasks \nwhere the last essentially um cue that \nyou have the last step here is okay I \nhave this file from this location for \nthis specific chunk now I'm going to \njust embed this thing and do the the \nvectorization like you do the \nvectorization and then you put it into \nthe vector database and so it's it's a \nwhole process of like how do you \ndistribute all of this load in terms of \nthe reading and the parallelization so \nthat when you get to the embeddings it's \njust this unit of operation that you \nknow you can just send to either an open \nsource model or whatever you want to do \nfor for vectorization and then insert it \ninto the vector database and we'll talk \ninto the the the vector database all of \nthe we stuff that we did uh in a second \nbut um essentially this is the whole \nflow and so in the end it's a \ndistributed system and and because of \nthat you also want to make sure that you \nhave the appropriate logging and the \nappropriate dead letter Q mechanisms and \nreach TR logic and hey you had 100 files \nbut you processed only 50 files what's \ngoing on with the other 50 what's the \nstatus of this 50 etc etc etc so you \nhave like this State Management along \nacross all of these tasks and and making \nsure that you can return to the user \ninformation as well as the logs so that \nyou know if they want to know what's \ngoing on that they can so there's a lot \nof moving pieces and I know I talked a \nlot but it's it's really the core of \nlike a distributed system where if \nyou've had experience with this in the \npast you could build it but then you \nhave now the the added it of the \nembedding cash and the embedding \nmanagement and the vector DV nuances and \nand whatnot so um it's way easier if \npeople see the image as well but \nhopefully if people heard me in this \npodcast then they can see that they can \nsee the the image and and and understand \nwhat we're talking about but um yeah \nI'll add the a quick intro to the blog \npost and so people can jump back if \nthey've already seen it I suppose but um \nyeah so I I really like this separation \nbecause I imagine with the process \ndocuments you know so you take a PDF and \nyou chunk that into like 50 Atomic units \nthat then are you know tasks in the \nembed store exactly and then you have \nthis fail Logic for if one fails and \nmaybe we need to go back to it yeah it's \nall super fascinating and I think uh \nkind of listening I think to have a \nbetter question to ask you next it would \nbe important for me and maybe our \naudience hopefully our audience is \ncurious as well to understand more about \nthe embeddings cache if you could tell \nme a little more about just particularly \nhow you see that yeah yeah yeah so at \nthe I'll try to explain it in like the \nvery simplest terms because I think \nthat's that's what probably will \nresonate the most but you get the data \nand you want to vectorize the data and \nyou want to get the embedding so that \nyou can put them in the vector DV well \nwhat you want to do is be able to have \nthis sort of cache so that for a \nparticular text let's say for a \nparticular um input that you're \nreceiving let's say like the hash of \nthis like like how how a typical cash \nWorks let's say the hash of this uh text \nis stored alongs the um uh embeddings uh \nof whatever that text was so that on the \nnext run whenever a new um unit of \noperation as you correctly put it comes \nin you can quickly check hey does the \nhash of this um of this text um uh has \nalready uh been seen in our embedding \ncach because if it already has then you \ndon't need to embed because you know \nthat the embeddings are going to be the \nsame and you just wasted the compute for \nthat when you already have the data \nright and so chances are that you don't \nneed to rebed um for that particular \ntext because you already have that into \nthe vector database and so this is \ncrucially important when because one of \nthe other things that we have at NE is \nthat you can run like scheduled \npipelines right so um maybe I didn't \ngive this overview but uh in NE you what \nwe've essentially done is a pipeline \nmanagement and a pipeline platform for \nyou to run this end to end applications \nfor rag uh you can um trigger like a \noneoff pipeline you can then schedule a \npipeline or we have some sort of support \nas well for um uh listening for events \nfor for for for specific sources so that \nyou don't even need to worry about this \nschedule we just listen to whatever has \nchanged like CDC kind of thing uh so \nthere's there's some sources for example \nS3 can let you know if a file changed \nand then you can listen to that event \nand whatnot we could get into that uh \nlater but the whole point is that you \nhave all of these functionalities and if \nyou're you're if a source does not have \nthe CDC capability of you didn't use the \nthe the the CDC uh capability for one of \nyour pipelines and you're rerunning the \nscheduled one or you were testing or \nessentially you're running uh pipelines \non the same Source then you want to make \nsure that you don't do overwork you want \nto make sure that hey this Source didn't \nchange this source is still the same \nlike let's not embed it let's just \nreturn very quickly and so that's the \nwhole point of the embedding scash so \nthat uh essentially you don't you don't \nwaste the the the time and you don't \nwaste the compute and the cost on on \nreeding something that has not \nchanged yeah that that makes so much \nsense I I think it's really nice it with \nthe whole theme of you know keep the \nsource and the destination in sync I'm \nreally starting to understand it better \nand yeah that yeah that cach yeah of \ncourse it makes a ton of sense if you're \nreinges your whole notion page and all \nnot ex so I think now would be a great \ntime to transition topics you know we've \ncovered kind of the high level the \nconcepts behind end to end data \ningestion now we' started getting into \nthe queue and how the qes and new and \nhow that works and now I think would be \nthis really interesting topic of the \nopen- source wva you know WEA letting \nyou customize the kubernetes and I \nremember the first time we we spoke \nKevin you had a pretty technical issue \nto \ndiscuss can you can you tell us about \nyour experience with kind of customizing \nvva yeah yeah for sure for sure yeah I \nhad tons of questions and and really \nprops to you guys for like two things \nlike your your documentation is really \ngood and then the support that you guys \nhave \num whenever we had a question is is is \nreally top notot so I'm really grateful \nfor that \nso uh in the end uh again uh what what \nwe're trying to do with neom is a \nplatform where you can bring your own \nVector database whenever you want to run \nthis pipeline right and so um for this \ncustomer that we were that we were doing \nthis blog post for and and for some of \nthe customiz session that we have \nwhenever a customer doesn't want to \nbring a vector DB that we use \nessentially our default one um in this \nblock po we were using um in this in \nthis run we were using web \nand because it's open source we were \nable to you know deploy it on on our own \nkubernetes cluster and and be able to um \nproperly configure uh and so there's a \ntons of things that um you can configure \nthat people can read on the \ndocumentation and whatnot but very very \nvery simple at a very high level \nis you have large scale data you \nprobably want to parize how you ingest \nhow you query the data into the vector \ndatabase \nso very simple things like having a \nmultinode cluster is super important and \nthat's one of the things that we want to \nreally do and and we really just has \nlike you know kubernetes confix where \nyou can say these are the number of \nnotes that we want this is the memory \nthat we want on each of these notes boom \nyou know you deployed it and and and \neverything works out of the box uh and \nso at the very beginning we were having \nproblems like well we have like six \nnotes that we had in our kubernetes \ncluster but uh web was only um listening \nto One and so it was like as if we had \none and so oh what's the problem there \nwell we had an enable sharding Okay so \nwe need to enable the sharding so that \nit goes and distributes the loads across \nthe different nodes so it was a lot of \nlike TR reading the dogs and talking to \nyou guys and understanding but uh the \nwhole point is if you have a multinode \ncluster that you can then configure with \nthe right resources in terms of memory \nand CPU then you can effectively again \nparallelize how you're going to be doing \nall of these injections because I told \nyou all of this about distributed cues \nand all of this data infrastructure that \nwe did and we've par ized a lot on like \nM's end we have the tasks everything is \nretryable blah blah blah blah but if \nyour ingestion is not like if your if \nyour vector database here does not \nsupport any type of parallelization then \nyou did all of this work and now it's \nall coming to this bottleneck that it \ndoesn't work so why did you do all of \nthis right so of course with we8 you \nknow because you can also distribute it \nand it's based on you know for for for \nfor the people that really know and \nunderstand and want to learn we it's \nbased on like the Cassandra AR ecture so \nyou have all of this um fa tolerant and \nand replication and charting strategy \nthat you can uh that you can distribute \nthe the the ingestion too and lastly and \nand and and we'll talk more if you have \nmore questions but the other thing that \nthat uh that was really important for us \nthat we Grant some quick benchmarks that \nare there in the blog post if people \nwant to see is well of course we want to \ntake advantage of W's parallelization \nand at the very beginning we were \nnaively saying well let's just paralize \neverything right and so uh what what we \ndidn't understand is so we it has this \nsupport for every time you ingest you \ncan specify the number of workers that \nyou want to um be using whenever you \ningest and so very naively we're like \nwell let's set that to whatever High \nnumber we want so that everything is \nparalized and clearly this was wrong on \nseveral levels first you need to \nunderstand how many CPUs you have \navailable in your kubernetes cluster if \nyou have four CPUs available and you \nsaid your number of workers to be 100 \nwell guess what things are going to blow \nup because you only have a certain \nnumber of threads that you can you know \ningest this information and then the \nother important thing is let's say that \nyou have I don't know 50 CPUs um but \nwith NE we were already doing \nparallelization so that different \nthreads can ingest into w at the same \ntime so think about this if you have 50 \nthreads on our side that are all \ningesting into weat at the same time and \neach of your weat ingestion has 50 \nnumber of workers that you can paralyze \nthen effectively you have 250 right like \nlike so \nso or or even more like depending on the \n50 times even more but what I'm trying \nto say here is that it's very important \nto understand the parallelization that \nyou have before you ingest and the \nparallelization that you have at your \ningestion we8 cluster per se so some of \nthe benchmarks that we run and \nunderstanding this thing was well let's \nsay that we have 50 uh available CPUs in \ndevate then we have let's say um 25 \nthreads in NE working concurrently \nbasically we we we we try to come up \nwith what what were these numbers and so \nif we have 25 then maybe we can set each \nof these threads numbers of workers to \ntwo two right so that if you have 25 \nthreads and each of them have two as \nnumber of workers in we you effectively \nhave 50 which is your maximum capacity \nthat wva can handle so I know I know I \ntalked a lot about like technical Det \nhere but the whole point here was to \nunderstand what are your resource \nlimitations on we8 how how how how high \nhave you uh how vertically have you \nscaled and horizontally you've scaled \neach of your nodes uh into your weet \ncluster understanding that and then \nunderstanding how much parallelization \nyou're doing at the extraction and \nembedding and and everything that \nhappens before the ingestion so that you \ncan then make sure that you maximize the \nthe the resources that you're using we8 \nbut you're not you don't go over it \nbecause if go over it then you start \ngetting a lot of these batch connection \nerrors and like I'm I'm I'm overwhelmed \nessentially the system is saying and so \nfinding that balance uh running the \napprpriate tests and and giving that \ncustomization to the user which is what \nwe do in terms of how many CPUs you want \nto run how many threats you want to \nparalyze was very key for us so I know I \ntalked a lot about that but um it's it \nwas super important for us to understand \nthese things yeah know that was really \ngreat and I just like I'm not going to \npretend to be an expert on this I'm \ntrying figur out \nas you know so so my question and I hope \nthis isn't a dumb question but if so I'm \nglad that there's never D question there \nnever Dum questions is um so I'm having \na hard time understanding the \nparallelization of this kind of like you \nknow uh process documents embed the \ndocuments and then and then with weate \nbecause my understanding would be that \nthese would be like Network \nrequests uh things but is it that \nbecause you're managing like one \nkubernetes cluster that's doing both \nnewe and WEA ingestion on the in the \nsame like infrastructure as code kind of \nset up that that's why you need to be \nmore fine grained about this kind of \ninterplay between the paralyzation of N \nand \nweate right right right right right so \nand and this is what I was telling \nbefore that um it's a great question \nlike if you have a lot of \nparallelization before and you don't \nhave any part like and and you just dump \neverything right into like a funnel that \nthat doesn't allow any parallelization \nthen you've effectively bottlenecked at \nat at at this stage um and and what's \nhappening here is \nthat if you have a lot of files that you \nwant to chunk and \nembed what you really want is to \nmaximize the resource the resources \ncompute wise of how you do that because \nwhat you could do is you could have one \nfile that you process that you chunk \nthat you embed and that you store into \nwe and you tell we hey do this as fast \nas possible use your maximum CPUs but \nthen you have 99 files that are waiting \nalso before you finish this thing and so \nwhat you want to make sure is that hey \nmaybe you can process the files parall \nyou can have different tasks where each \nof them are going to be chunking each of \nthem and then you're going to be also \nparallelizing the embeddings because \nagain like even even if you use open AI \nright open AI has this uh rate limit \ndepending on the the the account setup \nthat you have but let's say it's like a \nmillion tokens per minute or something \nlike that right and so let's say that \nyou used open AI we haven't we did talk \na little bit about the dimensions and \nstuff let's say that you were using open \nAi and you were just processing um one \nfile at a time with different chunks so \nat any given time you're only using \nlet's say 10,000 tokens it's like well \nyou're not maximizing the throughput \nthat you could get with open AI so chunk \nmore things at the same time embed more \nthings at the same time maximize that \nthroughput to get maybe the 1 million \ntokens per minute for example so that \nyou maximize the throughput there and \nthen everything can be ingesting in we8 \nasynchronously um or or any other Vector \nDV but in this case was we8 and \nparallelize that part so it's a it's \nlike a multi-step parallelization \nbecause you have different steps you \nhave different tasks you need to process \nyou need to chunk you need to embed then \nyou need to ingest and so um yes it's \nthis it's this fun and complicated \ninterplay of like how do you paralyze \nthe things that happen before you \nactually ingested into the vector \ndatabase and how can you make make sure \nthat whenever you ingest into into your \nvector D like we8 stuff is also getting \nparalyzed and maximizing the computer \nresources at your uh at your compute uh \nstore layer \nso yeah well that's all really amazing \nand I think the kind of yeah yeah like \nI've heard of things like I've had some \nconversations with Michael going at \nneurom Magic where we talked about um I \nwas always curious why there isn't more \nlike um you know blog posts about just \nlike here's how many embeddings we can \ndo in like a minute \nright and so I I don't know too much \nabout this kind of like batching uh like \nI've heard uh you know so like with uh \nwhen they're benchmarking model \ninference they usually would like uh \ngroup it by sequence length so they'll \nhave like you know 384 sequence \nthroughput on deep learning model \ninference and so I've heard a little bit \nabout that kind of stuff and the idea of \norchestrating that with how you do your \nchunking and then how you yeah all that \ndoes sound super no it is fascinating \nand look in the end is in the end is a \ncompute optimization and compute \nresource usage that you want to do like \nyou know when you submit a request to \nopen AI people might think oh it's an \nAPI I mean yeah it's an API but in the \nbehind the scenes there's some compute \nthat is happening for for for the \nsequence Transformers to actually you \nknow to to embed this data and so you \nknow if you have one GPU then and well \nyou can do so many texts at any given \ntime before the GPU starts to blow up \nthe same thing when you have like CPU \nparallelization on on on your computer \nthat you're running multiple tasks and \nmultiple things the more compute that \nyou have the more polarization that \nyou'll have but the more compute you \nhave the more costly is going to be um \nand so this is also like that that fine \nbalance that we didn't talk too much \nabout um uh that that we had to do some \nresearch in terms of well these are the \nrate limits that open AI enforces um \nthis is the cost of open AI this is \ndimensions of an of an AI what if we use \nsomething like replicate and and this is \nalso a YC company where um you know they \nhelp you with the with the hosting of \nthe models um and essentially do all of \nthis parallelization that I was talking \nabout but from a compute and and and \ninference embeddings model layer so that \nyou know you can submit these API \nrequests to replicate but you can also \nconfigure hey these are the maximum gpus \nthat I want this is my cluster this is \nthe things that I want and so again \ndepending on how much you pay and \ndepending on on on the cluster that you \nhave um well you can maximize that \nthroughput and and and um and get the \nembeddings in parallel before you go to \nthe the vectory but yeah this is a \nfascinating thing Conor like it's a \nthere's so many different layers and and \ndifferent compute resource optimizations \nagain it's at the core of like a \ndistributed system where you need to be \nable to pay attention to the different \nparts that uh that you have and and how \ncan you maximize and and parallelize \neverything um and and and the reason you \nwant to maximize and parallelize stuff \nis well you want \nto be able to run this in a \ndecent amount of time and not just a get \na pipeline that embeds gigabytes of data \nin two months you know like well CH no \nlike you want to finish this in you know \na couple hours so uh so so so that's \nwhat you wanted was thing uh but it's \nalways a trade so yeah I wonder if you \nknow mentioning replicate I find that so \ninteresting this kind of like um well I \nI think from the perspect the first \nperspective is just like you want to use \nthis MP net model which is like half the \ndimension size of open AI so it's a \nlittle easier to use but there's also \nkind of this emerging thing of maybe you \num you know train your own embedding \nmodel and that's like one idea but I \nthink another thing that's pretty \ninteresting with this is like with weeva \none of the biggest topics in weeva is \nthe development of multi-tenancy and \nmulti-tenancy is about your users have \nusers and you have the scheduling of \nlike active inactive and maybe also \nthere's something to like you know this \nuser is particularly active they have a \n100 million vectors in their we8 \ninstance and so let's give them eight \ngpus for their embeddings make it extra \nfast whereas the inactive they maybe 20 \nof them share a gpus right right right \nright so yeah I think this kind of \ninfrastructure is code and under you \nknow as you've really helped me \nunderstand better the these different \nprocesses that could be running in \nparallel it's quite the system yeah yeah \nyeah so yeah so I think all that was \njust really fantastic and I think kind \nof transitioning into more open-ended \nhow you see the future topics you \nmentioned like large scale and I'm \nreally curious just like uh in your blog \npost you mentioned putting a billion \nvectors into weeva how do you see this \nkind of like billion scale plus Vector \nsearch yeah and uh I love the question \nbut I always I always am SK not \nskeptical but like how I respond to this \nfuture looking questions because chances \nare that I'm going to be wrong on \nwhatever I predict here uh but uh really \nlike the the thing here is Conor is like \nwe're very early and you probably you \nguys probably know this better than than \nthan us but like we're very early in all \nof this like Rag and and gen \napplications that are coming at at at \nlarge scale and at Enterprise scale \nthere's a lot of like Twitter chatter on \nlike hey I built this thing and you know \nit's a couple PDFs and I use these \nTechnologies and these things work and \nit's great but what we're really trying \nto focus on is where are these billion \nVector opportunities like where are \nthese large scale opportunities and \nwe're fortunate enough that we're \ntalking and and working with a couple of \nlike um customers that have this sort of \nscale but I want to be also honest with \nyou and it's like we're still yet to see \nlots of people that have this oh I have \n10 billions I need to be able to have \nthis uh mechanism to be able to store \nthem it's like I want to talk to you if \nyou have that that sort of scale but \nit's like we we're also a very early \nstage in terms of how how many players \nwe're seeing that have this sort of \nscale and that have the sort of uh \nbusiness requirements for large amounts \nof data and so it's not really a \nprediction to answer your question but \nI'm really hopeful um based on like \nhistory of how data engineering started \nlike H how it has transcended in terms \nof like there's always going to be more \ndata there's always going to be more \nneeds to handle all of these data \ninfrastructure data management so if \nhistory repeats the same itself in in in \nthat same uh approach where on \ntraditional datalytics then the same \nthing will happen here like of course \nwe're just at the very uh basic layer \nright now where where the emerging \ntechnolog is coming but like can we \nreally be at a place where we're \nposition ourselves here to help the \npeople that uh that are doing the the \nreally large scale um requirements and \nand uh um you know be able to support \nthem and and uh I'm actually very glad \nthat you know for example in web8 um uh \none of the reasons we're using we8 for \nfor our uh for the pipeline run that we \nwere sharing there in the blog post is \nbecause of the easy to use and and and \nbeing able to scale \num horizontally and and handle all of \nthis parallelization for such a large \namounts of data and and there's some \nother stuff that we didn't even mention \nhere and and stuff that maybe for a \nfuture podcast or or something that I \nalso we didn't invest too much in but \nlike stuff like the grpc client that you \nfolks are working on which is greatly \ngoing to increase the uh speed of like \nhow you ingest and product quantization \nand how if you have large amounts of \ndata you can actually reduce the memory \nfootprint that you want to have with \ntrade-offs of course on like the inje \ntime and your search latency and whatnot \nagain everything is trade-offs but being \nable to to have all of these \nconfigurations for like large scale uh \ningestion and and and data I think it's \nit's crucial and it's uh what we're \nreally excited to keep working with and \nand finding this right set of \npeople yeah I love that answer yeah I \nthink that's all perfect just like kind \nof the the the assumption that all the \nkind of database workloads are going to \nmove into also having this kind of like \nvector data Vector database native kind \nof thing AI native and um yeah I think \nall that just makes a ton of sense but \nI'm also kind of curious about like um \nyou know what what kind of applications \nmight be able to be built with billion \nscale plus Vector search that we've just \nnever or let's say trillion a \nquadrillion let see how high I can \ncount yeah yeah yeah yeah I would love \nto know from from your point of view as \nwell like what what are your folks \nseeing because you are the store layer \nright so you probably have more \ncustomers other than than you know than \nthan us that that actually did a billion \nscale Vector as well I don't know if you \nhave trillion Vector scale honestly I \ndon't know who has that much yet but \nlike that probably will come um but yeah \nI'm also interested in in what are the \nsort of things that that that you're \nseeing because I think as we move away \nfrom like your typical chat bot \nexperience um into into more \nsophisticated uses of semantic search um \nwhere you know you have knowledge graphs \nand and and really be able to do \nsemantic search quickly over 100 billion \nvectors that you have in your store and \nyou get a result in subc like this is \nthis is the sort of thing that I think \nit's super interesting and um I don't \nknow what are your thoughts in terms of \nwhat are some of the applications um \nthat that can be powered with with this \nscale but uh it's definitely exciting \nwhere we're going um so yeah yeah yeah I \nthink to quickly I really want to go to \nthat knowledge graphs Topic in the \nmetadata I think it's so related to \ningestion I I say just concluding my \nthoughts on like what are the new \napplications available with quadrillion \nscale factor search yeah is I think \nwe're headed to like if you seen that \nRick and Morty are you aware of that \nshow where they have like the \ninterdimensional cable kind of thing and \nit's like you know it's like so we have \nthis concept in we called generative \nfeedback loops where it's like you put \nsome of your data in it and then the \nllms or the generative image models \nmultimo models will like do stuff with \nyour data like create new data out of it \nand I think it's very related to like \nyou know we have had this research \ncalled open-endedness there was you know \nwork by Jeff Clon Kenneth Stanley Deep \nMind has an open-endedness team and so \nthat's where I think that quadrillion \nscale Vector search is headed but I \nwould love to talk about knowledge \ngraphs because I think so so knowledge \ngraphs you know there's there's kind of \na couple things with this there's like \nthe you know thinking about graph \ndatabases and storing all your data as \nlike entity relation entity and these \ntupal and fast indexing of these like \nit's like a more native way to have \njoins in database sense and then there's \nalso kind of like Knowledge Graph like \nyou have this Rich metadata so you can \nhave like filtered Vector search so you \nknow if you have like I'm searching for \nyou know NBA players that play like \nKevin Durant but but also were born \nbefore 1985 and grew up in the west \ncoast of the United States so yeah yeah \nyeah yeah know that that's that's \nuh I don't know how to put it like we \nwe've gotten so many questions around \nthis learn like well I want to do \nsemantic search but I also have like \nfacts it's it's what we seeing people \ncall it I also have like facts that are \nnot really anything that you would want \nto semantically query on but rather like \ndo your typical select where this equals \nthis right and this is where the \nmetadata is super important and hnsw \nalgorithm right and and how can you put \nthe right metadata so that you can \neffectively do the hybrid search where \nand you probably know this more honestly \nmore in details but where you can do the \npriv the hybrid search where you have \nthe your typical semantic search over \nyour text semantically data but you have \nthe filters that you can do based on \nfacts based on dates based on names \nbased on places all these things that \nyou want to like filter on so that you \ncan then have a more accurate um \naccurate answer and I think um one thing \nthat we actually saw um uh for all the \nhate that L chain gets and and honestly \nI think L chain is great uh there's this \nthing in L chain called the self query \nretriever I think it's it's what it's \ncalled but it makes it super easy in in \nin in transforming a query based on some \nmetadata that you want to pass and some \nmetadata that you have in your vector \ndatabase to really create a query that \ndoes this hybrid search where based on \nyour natural language query some stuff \nis happening at the semantic level and \nsome stuff is happening at the filterate \nlevel and get an accurate response and I \nthink that's that's huge uh I haven't \nmyself played too much with that um uh \nto be able to talk to you for like 20 \nminutes about it but it's something that \nI think it's super important and and why \nwe're also so keen on whenever we \nextract data um at our preprocessing \nstuff that I was telling you making sure \nthat a we support for metadata inputs \nthat people can bring or we also come up \nwith basic metadata extractions or smart \nuh chunking smart metadata extractions \nnot dumb metadata extraction no but like \nreally um so that you can appropriately \nhave your vector information with your \nembeddings with all of the appropriate \nmetadata that can be linked to that \nVector so that you can do the the the \nhybrid search and whatnot so um again \nsuper fascinating stuff that um I don't \nthink it's like a solved problem today \non like how you do this thing and that's \nhow you see so many players doing all of \nthese different uh um approaches uh and \nand hopefully we'll evolve as well into \nhow we do this better uh but yeah I I \ndon't know what are your thoughts on \nlike hi hbd search and and uh uh usages \nthat you see within we8 from from the \nsupport channels and the customers that \nyou have uh and some insights that you \nmight have on this \ntopic yeah well I I think that was great \nand I I I guess I was super bullish on \nthis kind of extract all the metadata \nyou can have some llm that just looks \nfor anything that's symbolic and then \nmaybe we use that in SQL style query but \nuh then I was talking to Nils ryers \nabout this again who I consider sort of \nThe Godfather of AI search from cooh \nhere and and he was skeptical about this \nbecause it's hard to kind of unify \nmetadata and I kind of now I'm now I've \nkind of come to understand and agree and \nI because to me it's like the only \nobvious kind of metadata to have \nuniformly across things would be like uh \ntitle content source is three properties \nof a generic kind of unstructured vector \nindex content being the thing that's \nvectorized title is like a pretty \nuniform thing you'll find it in any kind \nof PDF blog post they'll all have some \nkind of title and then you can maybe do \nlike \nlike in the elastic search in the bm25 \nthere was bm25f where you would keyword \nscore with two properties and title and \nthen the main content thing being the \nmost common manifestation of that and \nthen Source being a common filter where \nyou you know where Source equals Twitter \nequals arive equals GitHub for that kind \nof not- taking dog food so I you know \noutside of that being so I I think a lot \nabout this kind of what would be like \nthe standard schema for Vector indexes \nand I think that kind of like title \ncontent source \nwhere content is the vectorized property \nand then maybe I think uh linking it to \nexternal tables that contain the \nsymbolic SQL style and but I love how \nyou brought up the self quering \nretriever from uh Lang chain and I think \nllama index and Lang chain they both \nreally push this like um Innovation on \nllm query engines you know like having \nthe llm do some intermediate do some \nstuff yep yeah and so yeah that's why I \njust think this whole like you know sort \nkeeping I love this this the source and \ndestination you you've just opened my \neyes to that I'm not going to pretend \nlike I had a good understanding of that \nbefore I spoke to you just now but like \nthis this like ingesting all these data \nsources and then having these like llm \nquery engines that can route queries \nacross it and having this Rich structure \nI don't really think you know I I like \nthe knowledge graph idea I think it's \nquite cool but I don't really think this \nkind of like entity relation entity \nnative way of thinking but you know I do \nkind of agree with this idea of like \nextracting facts and maybe like having \nsomething that's like is just a fact \nrather than like a paragraph of atically \nWR yeah yeah yeah yeah know makes sense \nyeah I think you probably know this but \nthe space is evolving right and and it \nit's eving so fast uh I don't know like \nevery day I go into Twitter and I see a \nnew parad paradigm that it's like okay \nmaybe we should include this as part of \nlike how how we extract metadata you \nknow so yeah it's fascinating honestly \nbuilding in this space at this stage I \nthink we're lucky um to to be able to be \na part of it and as long as we \nconstantly iterate and we constantly \nimprove \nand yeah things will fall through yeah I \nthink my concluding thought also could \nbe maybe that there's something to \nevolving your schema like maybe you can \nhave some kind of exper like we're \nseeing a lot of um people are curious \nabout how do we evaluate these systems \nand the most common thing is the llm \neval where the language model is \nprompted with like here's the query \nhere's the search results what how how \nare they and and then it kind of can \nself-tune itself that way and maybe you \ncan also self-tune the the schema and \nthe metad it could be quite deep I think \nit's quite complicated but maybe so so I \nhave kind of a concluding question I \nthink a lot of our listeners will be \nvery interested in why combinator it's \nobviously like you know the NBA of \nstartups how has your experience been \nwith and and I think also this year \nespecially is really relevant for our \npodcast because it seems like \ny combinator has definitely made a big \npush on AI deep learning LM based \ncompanies so I'm very curious like what \nyour experience has been with it for \nsure for sure in terms of the AI the \nnumber of AI companies in in dis patch I \ndon't have a number um maybe there's \nlike public information but there were a \nlot of AI companies majority on like \ninfrastructure developer tools and \nwhatnot and and some of the like \nconsumer side of things and and \napplication Level um stuff but um it it \nhas been an amazing experience man it it \nit it has been something that I've \nalways looked uh looked up for I spent \nfive and a half years in Microsoft and \nthen one year in in circle the the \ncreators of usdc for for those who are \ncrypto uh knowledgeable uh and I've \nalways wanted to you know start my own \nthing and and and be able to to to learn \nas I go and ship fast and whatnot and \nreally me and mounder have known each \nother for like 10 years and it was my \nco-founder's idea on like hey let's just \napply to W hater I'm like I mean sure I \ndon't know like isn't super hard to get \nin like yeah okay whatever let's just \napply and the funny thing is that look \nlike we even applied with a different \nidea right but but we show this energy \nwe thought this we show this motivation \nwe show this commitment we showed this \nyou know we're going to build we're \ngonna we're going to make it happen \nright and and you know from the \nlearnings that we had from from that \ninitial idea this is how NE was uh was \ncreated essentially but um it's it has \nbeen an amazing experience really uh \nthese people that really help you push \nyou it's really an acceler for that \nreason you're accelerating at a very \nvery fast pace um for the first three \nmonths and then of course they tell you \nwhy comat doesn't stop uh here in \nSeptember when you end like you need to \nkeep getting your goals you need to keep \ndelivering fast you need to keep \nshipping keep iterating and so I think \nthe the network of of people that we met \nthe the advice that we received and and \nthe whole acceleration and and and being \npart part of this uh of of this wave of \npeople that are innovating fast it's \nit's it's an amazing experience really \nan amazing amazing experience highly \nrecommend for people who uh who who want \nto build startups and and create \nsomething uh and want to meet more \npeople so amazing Kevin thank you so \nmuch for joining the weeva podcast just \nsuch an insightful discussion I'm so \nglad that our paths have crossed and \nI've gotten to learn these things from \nyou I think you know all the you have so \nmany great insights on this topic of \ningesting data and I really love this \nkeep the source and the destination in \nsync I think it's a super unique angle \nas well as your perspectives on kind of \nall the end to end stuff Kevin thank you \nso much for joining the wva podcast \nthank you so much Conor I appreciate it \na lot man thank you awesome \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Kevin Cohen
