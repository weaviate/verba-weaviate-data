{"text": "Rick Lamers, CEO and Founder of Orchest.io. Orchest is a tool targeted at data scientists and this software simplifies building data ... \n[Music] \nhey everyone welcome to the 11th episode \nof the we vva podcast today i'm joined \nby rick lammers the ceo and founder of \norcus.io \norchest is such an amazing software it's \none of those things when i first saw it \nin my day-to-day workflow i just said \nwow this is something that i need to be \nusing and i'm so excited to be talking \nmore about this and learning more about \nthe future of this and how the idea came \nabout and all sorts of things related to \nthis super cool software so with that \nsaid uh to kick things off rick can you \ntell us about uh what is orcist \nhey connor thanks for having me of \ncourse happy to share more \num orcas is really a tool targeted at \ndata scientists \nto simplify building batch data \npipelines and so \nwhat we believe to be true is that data \nscientists \nhave this incredibly productive existing \nworkflow and typically it involves rapid \niteration use of jupiter notebooks and \nthey're they're comfortable and \nproductive in that environment and we \nwanted to take \nthat workflow and bring it closer to \nthe process of productionizing these \ntypes of scripts and notebooks \nto a batch runnable \ndata pipeline with all kind of \nattributes one might expect \na data pipeline \ndeployment tool to have \nbut we really had the vision to make it \naccessible and familiar \nto data scientists data analysts who are \ncomfortable writing python and r uh and \neven julia or bash for that matter we're \npretty language agnostic \nand that's what we've tried to build so \nif the audience is familiar with \nsomething like apache airflow \nthey can see orcis as a similar version \nto that but a much uh \nsimpler \nuh story around how to actually deploy \nit and and really a lot more accessible \nin terms of uh more similar to the vibe \nyou get when you open something like \njupiter lab \nyeah i think even if you have no \nexperience with production and \ndeployment if you go to orchest and you \nwatch their introduction video you will \ninstantly it takes maybe 30 seconds to \nunderstand how to plug in together the \npipelines and i love the way that it \ndecomposes your jupiter notebook so \nyou know if you're a data scientist \nworking with these jupiter notebooks and \nyou collect these monolithic notebooks \nand maybe you're organizing them with \nlike the hashtags to collapse the tabs \nand have that kind of organization \ncompared to these pipelines or you can \njust separate out the things so what \nkind of things went into the design of \nthis ui how do you see the future of \nides with with data science notebooks \nand i love the you know the fusion \nbetween python scripts and jupyter nope \nand jupiter notebooks that are in the \norchest layer so how did you come up \nwith this kind of user interface design \nand what are your thoughts around it \ngenerally so so great question and we \nwe really spent a lot of time thinking \nabout the design tool and it was kind of \nbuilding something we'd want to be using \nourselves we'd been both working as data \nscientists in the field and larger teams \nand what we felt um was the \nwhat was needed was the flexibility to \nuse the right tool for the job \nand so \nwhat we felt like was sometimes the \nright tool for the job was a notebook \nbecause we could really appreciate the \nkind of rebel \noriented \nyou know \nstyle of coding in a notebook and for \nparticular types of tasks that kind of \nvery rapid iteration can be very helpful \nespecially if you're doing kind of \nexploratory data analysis but we also \nsometimes felt that once we had a very \nclear vision of some sort of isolated \nmodular piece of code that is just \nreally kind of um \nan abstraction or clear abstraction of \ncertain functionality maybe in python \nclasses that it feels very awkward to \nwrite that inside of a notebook so we \nwanted a tool that could blend the \nsimplicity of scripting and notebooks \nand allow us to kind of flexibly piece \nthem together in a way that requires \nvery little changes to the way we worked \nbecause i remember looking at all kinds \nof \neither ml ops or workflow orchestration \ntools and they just asked so much in \nterms of like please change your entire \nworld view and really buy into our \nframework transform your entire you know \ntransform your entire code base into \nthis you know application that's coded \nagainst our api and there's just so much \nbuy-in at the code level uh into the \nscheduler framework that really didn't \nmake sense to us we were like i just \nwant a way to bundle and connect and \nschedule this code but i don't want to \nmake the code like dependent on a \nthird-party framework and really embed \nthat into the code and i think you know \napache airflow for all the the wonderful \nthings it brings and it's really uh an \ninnovative project that has brought many \ngood things i think once you realize \nthat like the the entire scheduling and \ndata science processing code \nis kind of fully intermingled you can \nstart to realize some of the downsides \nespecially if you want to think about \nthe deployments uh in a more a bit more \nflexible way where sometimes you're \ndeploying on your local machine because \nyou're testing but sometimes you want to \ndeploy on a larger cloud cluster and \nlike how do you not become intermingled \nwith your scheduling framework too much \nyeah the modularity of it is incredible \nand i yeah i love that the \nminimal buy-in when you're adding this \nnew ml ops tool i completely understand \nwhat you're saying where you have all \nthis integration that you have to do to \ntie your code base into most of these \nexisting ml ops tools \nso another thing i wanted to talk about \nand something that again just stood out \nto me is wow i need to have this this is \nso incredible is the the cloud \nabstraction that you've provided with \noricas and things like say say you have \na web scraping python script that \nscrapes your data from some website and \nyou want to schedule that as a cron job \nwhere you have it run every day or every \nweek or say you want to schedule the \nretraining of your models every week \nonce a week and orcas has this beautiful \nintegration where to access these cron \njob services is just like a few clicks \nto be scheduling it up can you tell me \nabout overall this uh this idea of like \nthese cloud abstractions where you \nsimultaneously build a software platform \nfor mobs but you also kind of \nabstract away the complexity of the \ncloud computing into the software as \nwell yeah i i think you know you \nmentioned a great example scraping we \nyou know a friend of mine was trying to \nbuy a house and he really wanted to make \nsure that he got uh like quick \ninformation notices uh the moment \nsomething came available and so he he \nwas writing these uh these clouds \nscraping um \nor these python based scraping \nalgorithms and and and this bit of code \nand um \nthe advantage that orcas then provides \nthat if you're thinking about deploying \nthis as kind of a regular cron scheduled \njob to execute you also often need to \nthink about the dependencies you need to \nhave installed and in particular i think \nhe was because he was familiar with \nselenium he wanted to be \nhe wanted to use selenium in the project \nand what orchest bundles as part of its \nplatform because it's fully based on \ncontainerization \nbehind the scene so not very explicitly \nexposed to the user you don't have to \nknow anything about docker kubernetes \nbut behind the scenes everything is a \ncontainer it allowed him to just specify \nthe system level dependencies even and \nthe python dependencies of the selenium \npython package and he could just bundle \nthis whole thing and deploy it very \neasily as a pipeline and all he needed \nto do is in the orca's web ui he just \nneeded to run the bash commands he would \nnormally use on his local computer right \nso it's like whatever you would normally \ntype into your terminal to make the \ndependencies work basically one to one \nyou can input that into the work is what \nwe call environment setup script and \nit's it's just a bash file that gets \nexecuted and it's almost like \nfine-tuning an ml model but it's like \nfine-tuning a docker image so it's like \nthe final steps to fine-tune \nyour docker image uh to the dependencies \nthat you need and therefore it becomes \nvery easy to take your full pipeline and \njust run your quick setup script and \nthen actually run your code and we can \nthen deploy that anywhere so for him to \nbe able to have system level dependence \ndependencies like selenium really made \nit easy to like deploy that as a bundle \ndirectly in the orchest environment \nwithout ever having to leave the browser \nright and i think that's really powerful \nthat you can be at the abstraction layer \nof containers without actually having to \nworry or know about them \nso you get the power none of the \ncomplexity and that's really kind of in \nline with the main goal of the product \nit's extremely exciting for the adoption \nof the technology and yeah like you say \nlike you don't even have to leave the \nbrowser to set up the different docker \ncontainers and integrate different \nscripts that use different kinds of uh \ndependencies and all flowing into this \npipeline so \nkind of later on in the podcast we're \ngoing to talk about the integration with \nwev8 and how you uh connect these \npipelines into we vvates say python \nscript to process the web scraped \ndocuments and then put them into your \nwebva database but first i want to talk \na little bit more around these topics \naround ml ops and i think um so \npersonally i'm just coming out of a \nproject where i've developed this thing \ncalled karasbert it's a language model \nof keras information and i've been \nadding data sources with \nthese pipelines that i just think would \njust fit so perfectly with orcas when i \nsaw the initial diagram i just thought \nwow this is exactly what i'm doing in a \nmuch more organized way i love the look \nof this and so thinking about continual \nlearning and that kind of research \nproject as you're integrating and \nreusing your models and \nparticularly these um as you add data \nsources and then you add new \ngeneralization tests is continual \nlearning maybe the aspect of ml ops and \nthen following from here i want to talk \nabout hyper parameter tuning but is \ncontinual learning kind of maybe the the \nkey focus of this i think continual \nlearning is getting more attention and \nrightly so i i think the notion that you \ntrain your model once and that you're \nbasically done is kind of an \na notion that's no longer held by most \nof the ml community they they all kind \nof realize maybe you start out with \nsomething but sooner rather than later \nyou're going to detect and identify the \nareas in which your model is not \ngeneralizing well and you're going to \nwant to feed it examples uh that will \nbasically fill out those holes if you \nwill of the the generalization landscape \nand the way orcas thinks about this is \nthat a lot of the retraining can easily \nbe formulated as a as a scheduled job or \njob that gets triggered under a certain \ncondition and so what we generally \nrecommend people to do is they build a \npipeline and orcas and to make it item \npotent so if you run it multiple times \nyou will basically get quote-unquote the \nsame result \nbut if in instead of making it truly i \nitem potent but really kind of make it \nrefetch the latest kind of training \nsource whatever wherever you have that \nstored you basically can kick off a \npipeline many times whenever you feel \nlike it's a good moment to retrain \nand of course you also want to get some \ninsight into how that retraining went \nright and that's what where the beauty \nof having notebooks is part of your \nproduction pipeline uh comes in because \na notebook has the element of capturing \nthe rich data that is generated on disk \nin the file itself it's the jupyter \nnotebook format it contains this output \nand it has a huge advantage \nwhich means that if you run this \npipeline or retrain your model you can \nalso capture with it not just the \ntrained artifact but also all these kind \nof \ndata points that you might care about \nlike how does the what does the \ngeneralization look like or you maybe \neven have an updated test set \nbecause you've maybe have expanded your \ntest samples in order to now account for \nthese areas you discovered were \nunderperforming so i think the the the \nmodel of batch processing goes hand in \nhand with continual learning of models \neven if your model \nis really just a \nfine tuning of a larger trained model in \nnlp this is often the case \ni think this this kind of batch \nmodel just really aligns with that \nreality of needing to continuously \nimprove the quality of your predictions \nyeah and coming back to this idea of how \nit's bare bones there's so little buy-in \nfor using the orcas framework if you \nwant to integrate you know hug and face \ntransformers the gina ai fine tuner or \nmaybe you say mosaic mls composer \nrubrics data labeling or all these \nthings like even weights and biases \nhyperparameter tuning or say determined \nai hyperparameter tuning you can \nintegrate all these things into the \npython scripts and they just easily plug \ninto oricas which is another thing i \njust think is so exciting about this uh \nso can we talk a little more also about \nhyper parameter tuning i know some of \nthat is uh built into orcas as well what \nare your thoughts around that kind of \nidea yeah i think you know anyone who's \ntried to train a model will discover \nthat it's not so much of an exact \nscience as much of a black art where \nyou're really trying to \nidentify \nhow in what configuration is my model \nbehaving optimally and it's not always \nclear a priori how that like what that \nlooks like in terms of hyper parameter \nconfiguration \none of the design goals for orcus has \nalways been to take the best in class \nopen source tools at the disposal to you \nknow the data scientist or the machine \nlearning researcher engineer and make \nthem easily integratable in that \nenvironment so because we're at the \nabstraction layer of containers you can \ntake advantage of the whole range of \nopen source uh tools and the ecosystem \navailable uh to do your uh your model \ntraining and you know a really cool \nexample that i think the the especially \nthe nlp crowd will recognize is the koki \nuh text-to-speech speech to text um \ntools that are available like its \ncommand line can just be integrated \nsimply into orchest \nand that can that can even trigger like \ntraining jobs that are not even \nin a specific language but they're \nactually just like command line \ninvocation of a tool that's available \nand i think this kind of agnosticity \nreally allows you to take advantage of \nall the work that's going on the \necosystem and not really tie yourself \ninto a specific \nlanguage or framework and \nthat's that's been the goal since day \none is how do we empower that existing \nworkflow but also how do we make sure we \nleverage uh all of the ecosystem and not \njust the the strict subset of python \nbecause frankly if you look at a lot of \nlike sophisticated statistics a lot of \nreally good work is going on in r and i \nthink you know giving those people \nsecond rate experience would i think be \nreally bad if you're building an \norchestration tool right i think that \nshould be \nat a much more \ngeneric \nlevel than a biasing a particular \nlanguage \nyeah and i think the the integration of \nsay in uh in weaviate as we build deep \nlearning for search and we build search \npipelines you could think of this \norchestration layer is just so amazing \nthe way that you can connect all these \npipelines so usually in these search \npipelines we have retrieval then we have \nsome kind of retrieval fusion then we \nhave say re-rank or question answering \nsummarization supervised learning models \nat the end of it so in this \norchestration pipeline you could add the \ninference features as well the routing \nin the pipeline connecting the scripts \nto each other so it's such a great \nabstraction for say you want to have \nyour particular component where you're \nupdating your embedding model or you \nhave some other pipeline for how you \nupdate your re-ranker model \nand this whole thing of creating this \nwhole end-to-end experience where \nit can be not just training but also \ninference have you thought a lot about \nalso the pipelines for maybe say like \nensemble learning and aggregating \ninferences \ni think ensembles are \na great example of how \nreal ml has converged to \nrealizing that it's a powerful technique \neven though like the like the \ntheoretical analysis of an ensemble \nmodel is super difficult because you're \ndealing with sometimes very \nfoundationally different concepts of how \nprediction is generated so integrating \nthat mathematically is super hard but in \npractice it tends to really work super \nwell right so you might want to make use \nof it so if you're if you're doing kind \nof multi-model inference in order to get \nan ensemble result \nhow do you make sure that the code ends \nup being same like how do you make sure \nthat this thing still feels like \nsomething you can control i i really \nremember the stories of kaggle \nwhere \ncompetition winners would often often \nhave solutions that are so complicated \nthat the winners would not even be able \nto implement it for the company who was \norganizing the competition because it \nwas just so complicated so what we're \nreally trying to do in orcas is to get \nthat modularity where a single step can \nbe \ncan represent the inference of a single \nmodel and you can even have you know \nthese steps be parameterizable so you \ncould even have a single piece of code \nor a single script or notebook that \ntakes in a parameter which basically \nchooses the model and then you can use \nthat same step multiple times in a \nsingle pipeline and then there's some \nsome insanity and overview right you \nknow exactly that this step is \ngenerating uh the result and you can \nhave it very visually laid out \nand i feel like \nthat approach of of providing structure \nso you at least can see at a glance of \nwhat is my pipeline doing in totality is \nvery powerful if you're not working by \nyourself in particular i mean it's good \nto have overview for yourself but \ntypically you have a pretty good uh \nrepresentation of what you're building \nin your mind \ni'm sure all coders can relate that they \ncan like blindly navigate the ideas they \nhave but that's not so much true if \nyou're working together right because \nyou can't really look inside each \nother's mental models and so we have to \nindirectly communicate intent and i \nthink the dag just really naturally \nlends itself for this right so that's \nwhy we really like um the experience \nthat we've been getting described back \nto us from users of orcis they'll tell \nyou look i \nremember uh inheriting a pipeline that \nwas written in one of these abstract \nframeworks that allows like almost \narbitrary degrees of freedom in terms of \nhow the dag is actually generated so it \ncan take on arbitrary complex shapes and \nthen getting like an orcis pipeline \nwhere it's just like pretty \ndeclaratively defined it's just like \nthis this one defined dag and i can much \nmore easily \nfind my way through like okay what's \nhappening start to end and i think you \nknow you asked about ensembles i think \nit's one of those examples where if \nyou've ever touched a code base where \nensembles are used \nyou'll get that feeling of being a bit \nlost of like what's happening where \nyeah i think it's so interesting too for \ninteracting components of systems like \nsay you have \nagain these search pipelines where you \nhave several different components of it \nand and yeah i love the cargo \ncompetition pipelines that example like \nknowing about orcas now it makes it so \neasy for me to visualize these things \nthat the dags as you say just thinking \nabout plugging it into dags having the \nmodularity and also the cloud \nintegration coming back to that but it \njust makes it so easy to visualize how \nyou would really engineer things like \nthis and that's just something that is \ninspiring so much excitement with me \nabout learning about orchest and also \nsay things like reinforcement learning \nworkflows where you might have some \nmodel based agent you might have your q \nlearning you're separating all these \ncomponents out maybe you have like a \ngenerative adversarial network that \ngenerates data that comes back into your \nsupervised learning model \nall these components that flow through \neach other and this is just \ncoming back to i think because there's \nsuch a little buy-in it's your python \ncode it's so easy to understand how this \nthing connects together so kind of to \ncome into a like these real examples you \nhave with orchest um can you tell me \nmore about your integration with um with \nthe forum scraping and we v8 and \ncreating the question answering system \nyeah of course so \num \nthe \nthe really nice thing like you mentioned \nwith orcas is that you can take an \nexisting code base and you know you \nmight have your work divvied up among \nlike five notebooks you maybe have \nnumbered them neatly and it's like one \ntwo three four five or you could have a \ncouple of scripts that you usually \nexecute using the command line and you \nparameterize them like the way to get \nstarted in org is just like you you drag \nthat file onto the canvas and it's a \nstep and it will get executed in its own \ncontainer and you have to do almost no \nwork to go from existing code base in a \ngithub repository you just import the \nrepo repo as a project directly and you \ncan get started and so one of the \nchallenges that i wanted to \nuse as a way to evaluate are we doing a \ngood job with orcus is can i \ntake \nlike a very simple example of how to use \nwe v8 from python for data ingest and \nthen also for for searching with with \ngraphql um can i can i make an orcish \npipeline out of that that does this in \nthe maze straight in the most \nstraightforward way and um that \nexperience honestly was was really uh \nlike in a way it was a relief because it \nwas like testing our internal hypotheses \nabout like how the product should \nfunction and it turned out to work uh so \nthat was that was a a nice experience \nand the end result is basically a code \nbase that if you look at it outside of \nthe context of orcis you could just \nrun it and you you could basically just \nsee all of what's happening for like the \ningest and and uh querying the we v8 \nengine from a streamlit context so the \nway this pipeline works is we we allow \nyou like i mentioned to integrate \nthird-party \nservices so we have a streamlit \napplication aviate database running and \nthen the orcis pipeline itself is in \ncharge of fetching data from the \ninternet uh scraping basically comments \nand then injecting them into the \ndatabase and so the actual pieces of \ncode are just like fully independent of \nwork it's like streamlit is just a \nstreamlit app it's a python file it \nloads itself it speaks for itself it's \nvery simple and then the vv8 um \nservice running is just like a very \nsimple instantiation of the container \nservice \nthat we've yet provide so all of these \npieces individually \nnothing of that really requires any kind \nof orcas knowledge but then the final \nlayer that makes it all work is that you \nhave this one pipeline file which is the \norchest file and that pieces together \nall these things so it pieces together \nthe container services so it has the \ndefinition for the streamlit container \nit has the definition of the vv8 \ncontainer and it has the code inside of \nit to drive the streamlit app to drive \nthe uh the the ingest into ev8 and so \nthese pieces are basically uh glued \ntogether by orcis and the way you do \nthat is by simply just connecting a \ncouple of things in the graphical \ninterface \nand i think like uh \nthe the fact that that full definition \nis then fully versioned as part of the \nrepository and allows someone to take \nthis pretty complicated uh thing which \nis like web scraping that like actually \nscales ingests into a vector database \nthen \nserves a \nan application on it on its own port \nthat runs the streamlet uh you know code \nto to generate the dashboard that lets \nyou interface with the vva database from \na querying perspective like to have that \nhas actually worked one simple project \nin a normal github repository that you \ncan import as a template and just start \nediting and playing with i think that \nreally shows the power of three really \ncool \ntools combined right like it's the \nsimplicity of streamlight it's the it's \nthe power of we v8 for both ingest and \nquerying and then kind of like piecing \nit together as an orchestrator um that \nthat didn't require to change any of \nthose other two parts right which was \nthe main main idea so yeah that to me \nwas just usually exciting to be able to \nlike \nsee that thesis of integrating other \nbest-in-class open source into a single \ntool come together that was just really \nfun uh honestly to build as a project \nyeah and we haven't even talked about \nlike stream lit and gradio and how that \nbrings the user interface also it as a \npart of these pipelines and and again \njust easy python code that can be \nwrapped into these pipelines it's just \nso exciting and then um so we've talked \nso much about the engineering details i \nwant to kind of step up a little bit and \ntalk about this application of uh \nsearching through blogs and question \nanswering through blogs do you see that \nkind of changing the fundamental way \nthat we use say kind of like blogging \nand social media and that kind of \ngeneral \nthing \nabsolutely i think we have this \nunique opportunity today i mean \neverybody has been talking about big \ndata and like so much data becoming \navailable and like so much data being \ngenerated at every given minute but it's \nreally true and if you think about the \nimplication of having this much data it \ncan actually improve fundamentally how \nyou operate and i think now that tools \nare coming available \nto make this easier to do \neven with a simple example like like i \nmade like what i built at a high level \nlike without the technical details is it \nallows you to search through comments uh \nof someone on a forum and it's this this \nfamous dutch forum it's called tweakers \nit's for people who love technology and \ni remember when i was uh thinking about \ngoing to grad school i was doing a lot \nof searching on the forum because i \nreally wanted to understand people's \nexperiences having gone through that and \ni realized that the data was publicly \navailable because the forum was publicly \naccessible but the search was really \nhonestly it was quite bad so i really \ndidn't have a good way to get to that \ndata and query it and so i think with \nthe amount of data available and now \npowerful paradigms like vector search \nengines coming available to be able to \nactively activate that kind of knowledge \nwhich is like a huge sea of data but how \ndo you actually tap into it i think \nthat's the key and applications are now \ncoming available \nthat make this simple and i think codex \nyou know is a great example of taking \nall this embedded knowledge of like how \nto write uh against a new api of \nsomething like writing your first flask \napp with and without codex is just night \nand day right and so \nthat's tapping into source code i'm \ntapping with that example into all kinds \nof tacit knowledge that people have \nabout like school and education \nspecifically in the netherlands and so i \nfeel like \num actually being able to tap into that \ndata um is such an exciting trend and i \nlove seeing all these kind of like \nintuitive or like uh ingenuitive \nprojects from people who find public \ndata resources and really do something \ninteresting and cool with it and so like \nconcepts like open data but even just \nlike accessibility of like reddit data \nform data like i think that's really \nreally exciting \nyour example with vector search has \nreally opened up my thinking about what \nmight be the future of say youtubing and \nmaking content for technical knowledge \nand i was thinking a lot about my \nyoutube channel with deep learning \nvideos and how we kind of with question \nanswering we kind of have like two \nparadigms where there's extractive \nquestion answering and abstractive \nquestion answering and abstractive \nquestion answering kind of \nencapsulates this idea where like you \nturn me or say yana kilter someone who \nmakes content into like a chat bot and \nnow you can like talk to that chatbot \nand they can general generate novel \nresponses compared to extractive \nquestion answering where \nyou really just need to match your \nquestion with a clip in the youtube \nvideo and thinking about your example \nwith vector search with this blog \nwebsite i was thinking a lot about how \nyou can transcribe all of the youtube \nvideos to create this big text document \nand then with the question answering you \ncan match it to a text snippet and then \nyou know get the 30 second video and i \nthink that might be the future of using \nyoutube where oh my god i couldn't i \ncouldn't \nagree more and this specific example is \nsomething i've been bugged out about for \nso long \nlook i love podcasts but i have very \nlimited time you know \nwe're very busy and organized and we're \nlike we're spending so much time working \non the code and on the tool with the \nusers \nso i would love to be able to tap into \npodcast content how do i do that without \nlistening to all of it there's so much \nlocked up and so what i really like is \nthat they're in our tools that would let \nyou do a hackathon project where you \ncould \nliterally take \nyou know \n50 of your favorite podcasts download \nall episodes do nlp to extract you know \nthe transcripts and then to feed the \ntranscripts into a vector search engine \nactually it might be my next project \nwith we've eaten orcas but it's really \nreally cool to be able to tap into that \nkind of knowledge with the effectiveness \nof search because without search you \nknow um \nyou you wouldn't be able to tap into \nthat knowledge so you really need a way \nto be able to quickly look at a large \nvolume of data and i think you know \ngoogle \nreally did a good job of doing search on \nthe internet for web pages \nbut the world has turned into so much \nmore data than web pages in fact i think \nfewer and fewer individuals are \nproducing web pages right like they're \npre \nproducing rich media content and it's \nit's so important that we actually tap \ninto the knowledge of that type of \ncontent uh too and so yeah that just \ngets me super excited as you can notice \nyeah we had um we had alex kanan from \nzencaster which is the platform of \nrecording this hollywood quality \naudio \nand uh he explained their efforts with \nuh with pods podcast transcription \nsearch and yeah it's just such an \ninspiring thing and and coming back to \nwhat you're saying with the rich media \nit reminds me of say jeremy howard with \nfast ai he made a lot of \nvideos where he would be live streaming \ncoding and so the live streaming coding \nhe's going to encounter errors doing \nthat that someone who's \npre-meditating a youtube tutorial on say \nkeras pie torch like here's how you do a \ndata loader you're not going to see \nthose errors you're not going to quickly \nsolve them as much so the question \nanswering flexibility that's enabled by \nthese live stream coding sessions where \nyou encounter the error and solve it in \nthe real world and then \nusers \nis put into stack overflow they're lost \nthey need this new data source to solve \nthis problem have you thought about like \nwhat if you try to digitize all your \nknowledge and create a system like this \nyeah i think the the potential like \na lot of people gravitate towards low \nfriction content creation which is why \nthese live streams are such a nice \nmedium because a lot of very smart uh \npeople \nlike jeremy howard they they need to be \neffective with their time so if they can \njust do a live stream where they go into \nuh \nprojects and showing things or of how \nthey're done you know already that's so \nmuch value to be given out but how do \nyou then increase the value of such uh \ncontent that's being created i think \nit's by indexing it properly so so you \ncan very quickly jump into the content i \nthink a great example of this um where \nthe necessity and the value of it is a \nsimple phenomenon of youtube chapters \nright like you now go to videos that are \nlong form or people commenting \ncommenting like where are the chapters \nplease give me the chapters and you know \nthere's no reason why with the current \nstate of technology we couldn't generate \nthose chapters or markers or be \nintelligent about like allowing people \nto to jump to the relevant bit of \ncontent uh i think the \njeff bezos has an interesting quote he \nalways uh says like \nbet on the things that are probably not \ngoing to change right like what is \nsomething that probably nobody's gonna \nlook back on like i'm not sure if that's \ngonna be something in the future and he \nmentioned the example of like people \nprobably don't want to wait longer for \nthe goods to arrive right like \noptimizing shipping time is probably a \nbet you can make for like the next 10 \nyears i think attention and time \nkind of scarcity for for people \nespecially like you know productive \nprofessionals \nis definitely going to be a thing in the \nfuture \nbecause people are just getting less and \nless time to get to all the kinds of \nthings they could be doing there's just \nso much interesting stuff to work on and \nso \nbeing able to to to work on technology \nthat taps into that \nfoundational \num trend where people are gonna have to \ndo more and less time and are trying to \ndo more and less time like i think \nthat's really powerful and to me like \nthese type of topics we just discussed \nthey're like oh in that kind of bucket \nyeah i love that and i think \nyeah like what won't change like you can \nbuild this right on top of youtube \nthere's no need to start an entirely new \nplatform it integrates perfectly and the \norchest layer of adding the web scraping \nfrom python it's it made like orcas is \nsuch a brilliant abstraction that it \nmakes these whole this whole application \ndomain and this whole thing that sounds \nlike a grandiose vision it just it's so \neasy to visualize how it would plug \ntogether with this abstraction so coming \nback to orcas can you tell me about your \nexperience with building a company your \nvisions for the future and just \nyeah like what your experience has been \nbuilding this company \nyeah happy to dive into that area i \nthink it's \nit's it's one of those things where i've \nlearned so much over the past two years \ni couldn't really imagine learning so \nmuch and i remember thinking at the \nbeginning so we started a little under \ntwo years ago we started working on \norchest and i remember thinking \nshould i actually start a company now or \nshould i maybe get a job first and maybe \nget a bit more experience and then maybe \nread a bit more about how to start a \ncompany and like \nlurk some more on hacker news and like \nget some more you know \nadvice under my belt and i feel like at \nthat point \ni \nrealized that \ni should probably just go and start \nbuilding the company because \nit feels like i'm i'm kind of hitting a \nplateau on the kind of knowledge that i \ncould absorb \nfrom the sideline so to speak and so \ngoing into it i realized that was very \nmuch true it's very much true that \nthere's only so much you can learn from \nobserving other people doing a thing and \ni think it's true for many areas i think \nit's true for uh you know good examples \nfor me that come to mind are mathematics \nand programming like you can read about \nit all day you can read all the \nprogramming books but unless you've been \nin charge of building an actual system \nand dealing with the problems of \nupdating software state migration \nchanges like all of those examples and \ntheoretical explanations are not going \nto stick as much because you don't \nreally have the kind of experiences to \nkind of relate that knowledge to and so \ni very much feel like that with the \njourney i've been on with starting these \ncompanies \nthinking about how to solve the problems \nthat come up organically when you start \na company and like how do you convince \npeople to buy into the vision that \nyou're uh trying to realize without \nhaving realized that vision like that \nrequires in conversation to talk about \nthe \num you know the ideas you have in a way \nthat makes it accessible for someone who \ndoesn't know yet what you're trying to \ntalk about and so vocalizing thoughts \naround a product idea like that's \nsomething that's so hard to learn from a \nbook to be honest so i really um \nlike that you know i decided to take \nthat leap and i think i would advise if \nlisteners are thinking about starting a \ncompany to just go and do it i mean i \nmean i know it sounds super cheesy and \nit's it's advice that's been repeated a \nthousand fold but i i really do think \nthat at some point you just have to jump \nin and you'll start to discover all \nkinds of things about doing it uh and it \nturns out that there's also a lot of \nroom for not doing everything perfectly \nso \nyeah that that to to me has been the \nreality is like you you kind of can only \nlearn it and and grow so much from the \nsidelines and doing it um \nactually is is what actually makes you \nkind of \nlearn what it's actually all about so \ni i really enjoy this um this new \nchapter of uh post graduation \num company building it's been so much \nfun \nyeah i think our artificial intelligence \nsystems can learn a lot from that lesson \ntoo where maybe uh like some kind of \nreinforcement learning some kind of \naction would help them even take that \nleap as well yeah yeah i think you know \nif you're never going to take an action \nyou're never going to get that syncol so \nwhere's the reward right you don't know \nwhat has been the most challenging say \nnew skill for you to learn as becoming a \nceo \ni would hands down say \nthinking about how to make other people \nsuccessful \nbecause \ncomputer science and software \nengineering and even you know \ntheoretical research university is \npretty individualistic \nyou just have to really own the material \nyou have to go to the lecture understand \nall the complex topics that are being \ncommunicated you try to absorb all of it \nand you try to synthesize that knowledge \ninto uh being able to apply that \nknowledge to new problems and like in a \nway just generalize to new cases but \nthat's like a very \nuh individual process it's like you and \nthe theory right you and the knowledge \nand uh what i've realized uh when you \nstart a company it's you're trying to \nset up a group of people uh for success \nand the way to do that is to figure out \nwhat's preventing them from you know \noperating at maximum velocity so what's \nholding them back and it's also about \nprioritizing but also figuring out \nprioritization in a way where you can \ndirect people to work on the right \nthings in a way that \num uh \nactually works with with with the way \nthey work so you can't just ask people \nto shift targets every other week right \nyou need to also think take into account \nthe cost of switching the the cost of \nrealigning what you're working on so \num uh and you also need to take into \naccount what are their goals right like \nif they want to learn more about a \nparticular area of programming or like \nhow can you kind of make all these like \ncombinations um that end up making \npeople uh happy with the kind of work \nthey're doing and like not uh waste \ntheir really good potential because you \nwe we've been able to attract we've been \nsuper lucky to attract like really smart \npeople who really know what they're \ndoing and like i feel pretty big \npressure um \nto not mess up you know their capacity \nlike if i let them work on the wrong \nthing for months like that's on me i'm \nwasting their time it's not like their \nfault that they're working on something \nand it's like a two-way street right \nlike you don't \ndictate like what everybody's doing it's \nlike you talk about it with everyone \ninvolved like what do you think we \nshould be doing what it what is your \nidea of like what's the highest impact \nthing we could be doing right now and so \ni think those are all new experiences \nthat um \ni very much \nwas and am challenged by and i try to do \nas good of a job that you can do without \nhaving a phd in that kind of stuff right \nyeah it sounds so interesting and \ndefinitely like something that you need \nto learn on the job too with the \njust the nuances of people's \npersonalities and all sorts of things \nlike that and so on this topic further \nof um the high impact thing and not to \ngive away the secret but do you have \nlike a \nlike a thing in the say six months to x \nyears or however the time span is that \nwould be added to orchest that you think \nwould be a game-changing thing we're \nworking on something that i think is \nreally big um \nand \nit's it's always been part of the vision \nbut we're now actually close to \nrealizing it and \nwe've always felt that there needs to be \na proper abstraction so that distributed \nsystems level performance where things \nare fully distributed running \nindependently and performing at the \nmaximum capacity of of machines on which \nit's run not by like the the manual work \nof a coder that \ndata scientists can actually take \nadvantage of the hardware that we have \nat our disposal like these cloud \nplatforms they have wonderful scaling \ncapabilities but \nmore often than not it's still \nfrustrating and complicated to actually \ntap into it how often do you not find \nyourself kind of just \nserially \nsaturating a single node that you're on \nand so we've designed orcas from the \nground up because of the \ncontainerization primitives to be able \nto schedule over a large cluster maybe \nhundreds of nodes uh in a kubernetes \ncluster to be able to run all kinds of \ncode in parallel and even within single \npipelines being able to split up \nindependent tasks and run them \nsimultaneously even on heterogeneous \nnodes so maybe one task is very memory \nbound and one is very cpu bound and \nbeing able to allocate there and what \nwe're soon to be what we're soon \nreleasing is as part of the open source \nproject it will be this fully \ndistributed version where the control \npane of orcas itself is fully \nindependent from all of the scheduled \ntasks that are running as part of the \npipelines and so this i think is really \nexciting we're actually going to do a \nlive release at the upcoming data \ncouncil event in austin so that's going \nto be hugely exciting for us and the \nwhole team and you know \nthat vision of making it that simple to \ndeploy these production ready batch data \npipelines on a large cluster of hundreds \nof nodes with the simplicity that we \nhave in the tool today i think you know \nthat is going to be a very exciting \nmilestone for us \nyeah i completely agree i i'm thrilled \nto know about orcas now and i yeah that \nabstraction says amazing the clicking \nthe swiping in and out of different \ncloud services within this pipeline \nabstraction already in the containers \nincredible so what is um so kind of like \none more medical question about your \ngeneral uh training so to say is how do \nyou kind of do your information diet \nwhat kind of do you read blog posts do \nyou read scientific papers \nexperimentation \nit's a great question and i \ni uh i saw this around um i saw this \nhint being uh given by other people i \nthink uh just recently i saw i heard it \nmentioned by the guy who founded appsumo \nwho's an interesting character to follow \nbut it's about um \nso there are a number of information \nsources but how i actually digest it is \nby writing down a lot i write down a lot \nand i think paul graham has this really \ncool essay as well about how if you \nhaven't written about a subject you \ndon't really understand it or you don't \nreally know enough about it to be \nconsidered an expert on it because when \nyou write \nyou kind of have to \nbe honest about what you actually mean \nright you can keep stuff pretty vague \ninside your head you can like keep it \nkind of like partially defined where you \nthink you know but you don't really know \nand everybody everyone who's written a \nmasters or pc thesis will know \nwhat it's like when you try to formalize \nyour thoughts and then discovering \ngaping holes in your your understanding \nso \nin terms of information sources i try to \nreally you know i'm a very active lurker \non hacker news and sometimes responder \nwhere a lot of interesting software \nthoughts are being shared i think for \nacademic knowledge on deep learning and \ni really like also kind of more um \nquote-unquote simple mathematical \nanalyses of maybe like a support vector \nmachine and its generalization \ncapability so like \nfor papers i tend to rely on like \ntwitter feeding me uh you know the \nrelevant and interesting articles that \nare up in archive um and then um \ni i tend to browse reddit because i \nreally like how uh kind of brass tacks \nit is like people talk about very \nspecific types of challenges that \nthey're facing in their work and you \nknow their work as a data scientist and \nlike tool comparisons and that kind of \ninformation and then there are some \nquite good books that are being written \nso \nthere's lately been a book i picked up \nthat's about um \nwe can maybe link it in the show notes \nbecause i don't know the full name and \nauthor but it's about basically the \nmodern uh data pipeline uh set up and \nhow you know to think about the \ndifferences in etl and elt and how you \nknow all these concepts kind of \nmap to different types of tools and \ntechnologies now so using like a very \ndiverse collection from papers to social \nchannels like hack news and reddit um \nand books i will try to distill uh the \nknowledge into written form that are \nlike private notes i i don't keep them \nprivate because i don't want to share \nit's more that if i know that they're \nprivate i can write more freely and that \nit actually works more as a device for \nkind of processing the information \nand i also like to make lists so i have \nthis website called www.alldatatools.com \nit's an open source list of all the data \ntools that i could find that are \ntargeted at technical professionals so i \ni excluded like no code tools because i \nfeel like it's a category that i'm not \nspecifically trying to map and catalog \nbut it's it's really kind of a \nway for me to also have a good kind of \ntaxonomy and list of what's going on in \nthe space and i like to use that as a \ntree to also kind of connect the \nknowledge that i'm gaining too so some \nareas of nlp some areas of more \nengineering topics and so you know \nthat's just a little bit of how i try to \nstructure my thought but \ni don't know what do you do \noh uh \nwell yeah i really like the idea of the \nlist i've i've tried to take lists but i \nfind it it can be kind of intractable \nlike it blows up quickly when i try to \njust do a top-down list and i struggle \nto \nuh keep the high-level categories that \nmap the list and keep that ontology sane \nsort of with deep learning research but \nyeah i completely agree i love writing i \nthink writing it forces you to as you \nsay you know be clear about what you \nreally know and \nyeah i \nfor me writing is definitely a huge \nsource and then yeah twitter the social \nfeeds i definitely disagree with all \nthat and then \ni do think running experiments is also \njust a huge way to build your knowledge \nfurther as you mentioned with the \nexperience of building a company you \nneed to actually do it and just in \ngeneral making sure you're doing it \ninstead of just talking about it too but \nyeah \nreally cool stuff nice so thank you yeah \nso thank you so much rick uh i thought \nthis was such an informative podcast i'm \nso excited about orchest and i loved \nhearing about the integration with wev8 \nas well i think this is such an exciting \nthing for the future of data science and \ndeep learning technology becoming \nrealized into things like as we talked \nabout the uh the future of blogging \nwhere you could have a direct question \nwith a blog or a youtube channel and i \nthink all these things are just really \ncoming together in such an exciting way \nso thank you so much for coming on the \nwe va podcast thanks for having me \n[Music] \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Podcast #13 \u2022
