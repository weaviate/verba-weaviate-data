{"text": "Thank you so much for watching the 33rd Weaviate Podcast! This episode features one of the heroes of Deep Learning for Search ... \nthis interview is recorded shortly after \npublishing our integration with coheres \nmultilingual embedding models in \nweeviate to try this out for yourself \nplease check out this excellent blog \npost written by Sebastian woodaleck this \nis linked in the description of the \nvideo I really hope you enjoyed this \ninterview with Nils rhymers I learned so \nmuch as the interviewer and I really \nhope you do as well as always we'd be \nmore than happy to answer any questions \nor discuss any ideas you have thanks so \nmuch for watching hey everyone I'm so \nexcited about our next wewva podcast \nwe're hosting Nils rhymers Nils rhymers \nis one of the most influential \nscientists in this whole area of deep \nlearning for surge he's done so much \nincredible pioneering work especially \nwith tech search and I'll kind of hop \ninto this The Narrative as I see it and \nthen ask Knowles to kind of hop in on \nthe origin of this kind of research but \nto me it kind of looked like we started \nwith this thing where we can extract \nrepresentations of data from the \nintermediate layers of deep learning \nmodels and then what happened is we \nstarted optimizing directly for those \nrepresentations using contrastive \nlearning loss functions and I think this \nwas super successful in computer vision \nwith papers like simclear Moco and then \nNils and his team they started showing \nhow you could do this with Siam these \nbird Network sentence bird and developed \nthe whole sentence Transformers Library \nthe beer benchmarks and really showing \nhow successful this technique could be \nso firstly Nils thank you so much for \njoining the podcast yeah it's pleasure \nto be here uh so could you kind of take \nit in on that uh kind of what I left off \ncould you kind of take over the like \nkind of the origin story of how you came \nto be working on uh this kind of like \nSiamese encoding of representation \nlearning yeah sure \num that was not really planned that I go \ninto that field so back then in 2018 \nI've been working on clustering \narguments so in our research group we're \ninterested in like controversial topics \nlike should you still run new club \nnuclear power plants \nand we wanted to Cluster arguments on \nthis like opposing or supporting and and \nopposing Arguments for that \nand back at that time methods were like \nUniversal sentence encoder and \ninfrastrant \num the big problem here was that they \nonly released the model like Facebook or \nGoogle only released the model but did \nnot release any training code did not \nprovide like really a lot of information \nhow to train these models and this was \nlike a bit but I don't know \nwas bit annoying for me because I really \nwanted to have like \nsome metal models that I can train \nspecifically for this task \nand yeah that started to get me on the \njourney how can you train the embedding \nmodels we also said okay that's like \nreally frustrating you have these models \nbut they work really poorly out of the \nbox for like really special \nscenarios like argument clustering \nso I thought okay let's start a library \num that makes it extremely simple to \ntrain your own embedding models at that \ntime birth was recently popular so I \nthought okay let's figure out how to use \nbridge for clustering information \nand that was like the origin for \nsentence for sentence Transformers and \nfrom then on since 2018 I've been hooked \non the topic uh because representing \nstuff in Vector spaces open up so many \nopportunities and cool applications you \ncan build with that \nthat's so interesting uh yeah I learned \na lot about topic analysis from talking \nwith Martin grutendors on our other \npodcasts about bird topic and we also \ncame on cohere talks and talked with Jay \nand uh yeah that that topic analysis \nsuch an interesting point to it um so \nmaybe uh coming into it um so can we \nstart out with so learning \nrepresentations of text with deep \nlearning um I'm really curious about if \nyou could kind of tell this whole story \nsort of like I know about like the whole \nin batch negatives the info nce \num you kind of tell the story around \njust like your investigations into sort \nof how you sample positive Pairs and \nnegative pairs model size data size \ntraining requirements all these kind of \nthings \nyes so in the original sentence for \npaper I followed the the approach from \ninfrasound using nii data and training \nlike cross entry \nwhich I totally can't recommend to do \nanymore so so actually the original \nfirst sentence per model performed \nreally poorly \neven such the benchmarks were really \ngood at that time whether the benchmark \nscores were good if you really apply \nthem to a bit more complex data \num they perform really poorly they also \nperform really poorly worse than \nUniversal sentence and code at that time \nso this was like really nagging for me \nlike okay how can you train better \nmodels and how can you evaluate better \nmodels so this is like two major pillars \nof my research not be justified hey I \ngot both numbers on some arbitrary \nBenchmark because most benchmarks are \npretty bad \nbut first how can you assess them that \nthey're really good and how can you make \nthem better the infancy lost when I \nstarted was bit \nit existed but it was like really really \nunknown so the universal sentence \nencoder method they trade already was \ninfluency loss or \nI mean there are so many names for it \nbut it was not really described in the \npaper so it was like really hidden and \nthen if you follow up some some other \npapers they had a really complicated \nformulations for influence e loss \num and yeah no training code was \navailable but yeah at some point \num what's the help of a student help of \nmine we actually implemented one of the \nreally old implementations of the \ninfluency loss from Google \nand I'd share like really good results \nand then it's also made them a lot more \nsense than the previous cross entropy \nclassification loss \num big things which are relevant here is \nlike batch size so that's a simple trick \nto increase your embedding performance \nincrease the batch size but sadly at \nsome point you run into limitations of \nGPU memory \nand because we don't have like an \naverage right number of GPU memories in \nmy research lab back then \num we invest a lot of Time how to make \nthe batches better \nspecifically adding Hardware Gators to \nit but here you need a lot of cleaning \nso so really you want to push \nanchor and positive close in the vector \nspace and anchor negative distance in \nthe vector space but this loss extremely \nsensitive if the data is unclean \nso if anchor and positive it's not \nreally positive pair that's extremely \nhurting the performance \nsimilar when anchor negative \nwhen it's not really a negative but a \npositive another positive that's also \nextremely hurting \nthe performance of the model \nso spend a lot of time thinking working \ntesting how can you make it nice and \nclean and have like really high quality \ndata at scale \nuh it's so interesting and uh another \nkind of podcast we did was with Ori ROM \non uh the spider algorithm learning to \nretrieve without supervision how um you \nlook for overlapping terms to form the \npositives and as you mentioned the noise \nand the negatives I've always been so \ninterested in that kind of thing um \nso what so what are you thinking \ncurrently about the positive negative \nsampling scheme is it uh you know like \njust adjacent paragraphs or positives \nand then if you do that at scale it kind \nof like makes it all right \num when I'm a big fan of is like to use \nmore powerful so-called cross-encoder \nmodel \nfor data cleaning so often you start \nwith like some anchor positive pairs \nthese are often quite easy to to get \nlike \nyou take scientific applications and you \nsay okay the title and the abstract \nthat's probably like a good pair that \nshould be close in the vector space or \nyou go on \num stack exchange and you take a \nquestion and you take the highest ranked \nanswer and you say okay that's what's a \ngood pair that should be closed in \nVector space \nbut how do you get like really high \nnegatives so heart negative is for \nexample \nI don't know for example you have a \nquestion how can I sort a python list in \ndescending order and then the positive \nwould be how to do it and the hardest \nnegative would be to say okay this is \nhow you do it but in ascending order so \nthere's like a slightly tiny detail \neverything else matches but there's a \nslightly tiny detail \nand that makes it not a valid answer and \nfinding this is like really really hard \nso how can you find like a negative \nthat's so close to the correct answer \nbut it's still still negative and often \nyou overshoot so you get like the the \nnegative that's also where person would \nsay yeah that's another positive \num so here I really like Crossing \nfolders Crossing covers a lot more \npowerful than by encoders \num \nso so you first drain a cross encoder \nand then the cross encoder can do cross \nattention between the query and or the \nthe candidates and can really see it \nlike these fine details like okay is it \nlike really matching all the aspects \nyou're asking your question and then at \nthe end if you like a score and then you \nuse this cross encoder uh you go over \nall your triplets black anchor positive \nnegative \nand say okay here we have like actually \nnegative pairs uh or negative candidates \nyeah it's a I think there's a there's a \nbit of that that I want to unpack and I \nthink um you know being here talking to \nnose Runners I want to just dive right \ninto the the details of the technical \nquestions um but so maybe for our \nlisteners quickly the cross encoder is \nthis idea where you take the query and \nthe document as input to like a high \ncapacity Transformer that will output a \nscore and it's slower than the buy \nencoders but it's like super accurate \nbecause of the high capacity of the \nTransformer uh so I want to come back \ninto the the you know you mentioned the \nstack exchange and I think the work on \nthe 1 billion training Pairs and then \nthe diversity of the beer benchmarks I \nthink those are so interesting I really \nwant to come back to these topics but \nquickly again talking in those rhymers I \nhave to ask this question um what about \nlike a knowledge distillation from the \ncross encoder to the buy encoder where \nthe cross encoder it kind of sounds like \nthat's what you're getting at where it's \nfiltering the data \ncould it you know have like a soft label \nwhere the score that comes out of the \nCross encoder is the um what the dot \nproduct should be yeah and yeah I'm \nsuper a big fan of this so Sebastian \nHostetter established this in a really \ncool work where he showed how you can \ndistill Knowledge from Cross encoders to \nmy encoders and which led to the March \nand MSE loss which solves a lot of these \nissues so in classification construction \nof training you need the positive to be \nreally positive to the query and the \nnegative must be really a negative to \nthe query so you spend a lot of time \ncleaning \nand trying to get like the hardest \npossible negative that is still a \nnegative and not yet a positive \nbut I was machinimus he lost you take \nthe triplet query positive and some \nother candidates and pass it through a \ncross encoder to get like estimates from \nthe cross encoder \nhow close are the two candidates to the \nquery \nand then you transfer this knowledge to \na buy encoder and this totally \neliminates the issue of getting really \nclean data so you can run it with like \nreally dirty data which is nice \nyou can run it with like really really \nhard negative so far with the she tried \nbuying folders and my negative is like \ntoo hard for my encoder it extremely \nhurts your performance but now you can \nstill still run it so I'm a big fan so I \nin most cases I moved away from \ncosmetrical training to margin MSC \ntraining \ndownside here is a bit more overhead so \nconstructive training there it's like \nreally easy to get training examples to \ngo on stack Exchange \nyou download it you get the question you \nget like 400 million questions the \nhighest ranked answer \nso you get directly 100 million \npairs you can use from constructive \ntraining but of course machinimously \nloss you have to do negative mining you \nhave to have a good cross encoder you \nhave to take the cross encoder to score \nall query anchor uh query positive \nnegative triplets so there's like a lot \nof overhead involved in that \nuh so sorry to ask a clarifying question \nbut the margin MSC that's where you \ndon't you have to kind of explicitly set \nthe margin in the triplet loss and I \nalways thought for that reason it was \nsort of funky like because it's kind of \nlike a alpha minus Max uh kind of thing \nright \nall right \nyou take the cross encoder you asked \nlike two questions like Quarry and \ncandidate one and query can you take two \nwhat's the relevance and this gives you \nlike two relevance so the one has for \nexample I don't know relevance 10. the \nother has relevance five \nand then you use this distance so you \nsay okay the the distance from candidate \na to candidate B is like five \nand then you transform this to a by \nencoder that the by encoder if you \ncompute the dot product between query \ncandidate a and candidate B should also \nbe five in the vector space \nso basically what you do is you \narbitrarily pick \nthree points so you have to query you \nhave candidate a candidate B you ask the \npowerful cross encoder what's the \ndistance \nand then you teach the buy encoder to \nmatch also the distance in the vector \nspace so the crossing code that teaches \nthe the buy encoder about distances in \nthe vector space \nokay fantastic yeah awesome so yeah yeah \nI think that idea is going to be super \npowerful with the because you you want \nthe cross encoder is so kind of slow \nespecially if you just go into a billion \ndocuments and then maybe you want to \nretrieve a thousand re-rank a thousand \nso I think that kind of distillation \nwill be super impactful uh can you tell \nme about I want to dive into the effort \non collecting the billion data pairs on \nuh I think it's like Wikipedia stack \nexchange Reddit uh there's like a big \ncollection uh he told me about the \neffort involved in that yeah \num \nso so yeah and last year at Target phase \nwe had like this community event \num where we got like \num some resources sponsored by Google \nCloud to work on tpus and Jacks and then \nwe said okay it would be cool to to \nReally train embedding models \non a lot of training data so far a \nsentence Bird model have been trained on \nlike Wi-Fi small training sets Universal \nsentence encoder have been trained on \nlike billions of training pairs but \nSally training was not available \nso we we put the efforts together and \nfound like okay what are good resources \nget labeled resources \none is like I don't know Ms Mark or NQ \nall this data set here are duplicate \nquestions to just collect them bring \nthem to a standard format \nand then stack exchange have a lot of \ndata available but in XML format so it \ntakes on pre-processing time to go from \nXML dumps to high quality Q and A pairs \nuh similar for Reddit there are like \nsome big dumps available on Reddit so it \ntook some time to process it to get like \num \ncomment and or answer \npost and comment structures \nand then yes I spent a lot of time to \nget the data clean the data and then \ntrain a model so in general \nbig Advocate on data qualities so people \nshould spend a lot of time to get like \nhigh quality data \nand then truly the the models you apply \nand the methods you apply it's like \nrather straightforward after that \nyeah it's really interesting um because \nthe contrastive learning is \nself-supervised like the auto aggressive \npredictive Mass token and so I think \nmaybe the focus on data quality is less \nso because the philosophy is like we're \ntaking advantage of all this unlabeled \ndata so can you maybe tell me a little \nmore about how you think about data \nquality in the self-supervised thing \nwhere you have just the crazy amount of \ndata so how do you clean it do you \nde-duplicate it \num yes so in general what we see \nis that data quality is critical like in \nevery aspect be it like generative model \nor an embedding model \num what works nice is often like a \ntwo-stage approach first you you train \nwith some approach \num \nunlike noisy data like you take a burden \nat work and you run Mass language \nmodeling unlike a lot of data \num or you you run like this inwards \nclose tasks and a lot like a lot of data \nso where you take like a paragraph and \nrandomly take a sentence from this \nparagraph and then this is your pair \nbut what's really critical is the second \nstage where you're training like on high \nquality data for the tasks you want \nand here data quality plays like an \nextremely critical role so out of the \nbox bird was MLM or ICT train doesn't \nwork well for search but if you then \nshow like some search examples you can \nget really good strong results and yeah \nI think it's valid you can't focus on \nboth so first pre-training or for more \non the fine tuning step I don't have a \ngit I don't have a intuition which is \nmore important should be more focused on \nthe pre-training or should you more \nfocused on the \nand the defined tuning I would say \nme personally I've spent more time on \nfine tuning and tried to find like high \nquality \nquestion answer pairs or triplets to \nfine-tune and the model on this \nyeah it's so interesting and I I \ndefinitely want to dive into the new \ncohere multilingual model and see what \ndetails I can tease at you but \num with the the sentence Transformer all \nmini LM that's been a just super \nimpactful model it \nhas an incredible zero shot kind of \nability is that the that's the \npre-trained model correct and it hasn't \nbeen fine-tuned yet so it's like the \npre-train on massive \nnow the the r mini iron model has been \npre-trained on these like billion pairs \nlike question answer pairs duplicate \nquestions and so on \nvery interesting and yeah I think uh \nyeah the the zero shot ability of those \nmodels to encode all these domains I \nthink that's just a huge thing um in our \nlast podcast Chris Dawson had said that \nuh like a lot of these tools are like \nthe perfect MVP minimum viable product \ntool that it solves like 80 of the cases \nout of the box and I think it's very \ninteresting as we talk about this kind \nof philosophy of fine tuning so I think \nthis would be a great topic to kind of \npivot into the philosophy of coheres \nmodels and as you're developing these \nsuper powerful models um how you're \nthinking about pre-training and fine \ntuning and generally anything you want \nto talk about \nsure so yet here we recently launched \nour multilingual embedding model \num this week Monday \nso so far we had like these really large \ndata set collections in English so \nbecause in English it's easy you go on \nstack exchange you download the XML \nfiles and then yeah you have to do the \nhard work to clean or extract data from \nthe XML files but at least you have the \nthe big dump of Stack exchange and this \ngives you already like 100 million \nquestion answer here so if you train a \nmodel on this \nper month extremely good \nso far an issue with multilingual models \nhas been data \nsome people previously used like machine \ntranslation to translate Ms marker to \nother languages but here the issue was \nmultilingual models is that they learn a \nU.S Centric machine translated \nview on topics so for example in Ms Mark \ncalled Big topic is like how do I do my \ntaxes in the US so if I do this and take \nit with machine translation translated \nto German \nand the model learns in German how do I \nfile my taxes in the yes and how how do \nI file certain forms but it has like a \nblind spot how do I do my taxes in \nGermany and me as a German German \nspeaker I wanted to do know how do I do \ntaxes in Germany and how do I fill in \nmuch like certain tax forms in Germany \nand so this was like a big missing spot \nof these a lot of previous models also \nmost previous models only worked on like \nsentence level which like really bad for \nsurgical you want to match like a query \nto like a long long paragraph or longer \ndocument \nso here we took like the same recipe as \ndescribed before so we first collected a \nlot of data from the web so found like a \nlot of resources like tens tens of \nthousands of these uh websites \ncommunities FAQ pages on on \nwebsites news articles and so on and \nthen try to find like quality or \ntraining pairs in here like question \nanswer pairs basically \num did a lot of filtering to really \nfilter out \num high quality question answer pairs \nhere big challenge is like to scale to a \nlot of languages so in English \nthere's like a way how you can look at \nlike okay what's like a good \ngood pair what's a bad pair you can do \nlike some wreck X \nsome \nfiltering like I could for example I \ndon't know you count the number of white \nspaces to see if a paragraph is well \nformatted or is just like some random \nstring but the challenge is if you do it \nacross 100 languages it's like so \ndiverse so for example if you go to \nChinese you don't have like white spaces \nso how do you know if a text is like \nactual proper Chinese text or is it like \njust some random Chinese words \nand so somehow you have to find like \nways to to scale to these hundred \nlanguages \nand then the third step was like data \naugmentation finding good hot negatives \ncleaning them \nand then taking these \ntriplets and try trying the embedding \nmodel and yeah overall we got like 900 \nmillion English triplets uh close to 500 \nmillion non-english triplets and then \npassing this to a model \nwhich gives you again like a model that \nhas seen a lot of topics you can apply \nit \nto your taxes or online gaming or beauty \nor fashion or computer science because \nlikely in these 500 million non-english \nquestions it has seen such a topic or \nsimilar topic already \nuh it's so interesting uh there's so \nmany things I want to unpack I mean \nyeah first aid income there's also this \nmiracle Benchmark that's going around on \nmultilingual and I think that's about oh \nman I'm trying to guess now but it's not \nI don't think quite 500 million if you \nsum total all the languages other than \nEnglish and I know it's 32 million \nEnglish so it sounds like yeah a massive \ndata set and that's this is kind of the \nthing I wanted to get a little more into \nwith this kind of private models public \nmodels thing is I think with the private \nmodels and the kind of business model \naround it it makes sense it makes sense \nthat you know coherence or say open AI \non the other side of the fence can build \nthese like massive data sets and and be \nkind of \nincentivized to build and have a \nsustainable thing around building 900 \nmillion English 500 million sorry \nuh non-english terrorism so maybe could \nyou talk more about just like the \nchallenges of collecting data when \nbuilding the sentence Transformers \nproject compared to now a cohere \nand \nso yeah I mean that the challengers are \nalready similar so \nyou have to do work which is for a lot \nof people painful so a lot of people \ndon't enjoy working on data so people \nwanna \nfind the best loss function and try to I \ndon't know add some skip connections to \nit \nbut people do not really enjoy working \non data like \ndownload this or find like all these XML \nfiles from stack exchange for example \nopen the stack exchange format deposit \nfind the right pairs on this so so \npeople do not really enjoy this but I \nthink that's where a lot of value comes \nfrom \num obviously if you process a lot of \ndata it also requires a lot of compute \nso that's that's \ntrue that's kind of been erected so if \nyou have like a billion training Pairs \nand you want to train on this this takes \na lot of time but also data cleaning so \nwe we pass like these billion training \npairs through a cross encoder \num so first you have big cross encoder \nand then you need to do like inference \non a billion pairs so that's awesome \nsignificant amount of time \nyeah well that's super interesting and \num yeah there's that that whole thing is \nreally interesting I want to kind of \ncome back into the multilingual thing \nand uh something that's always scared me \nwith multilinguals kind of as you say \nabout the Chinese you don't know when \nthe like the white space or say the \nperiod here is or like the uh line break \nfor paragraph heuristics all that is so \nuseful um and I'm also jealous of say \nthe Europeans I know it's semi say uh \nBob and Eddie and they all speak \nmultiple languages whereas me I only \nspeak English uh so like with the \nmultilingual dude what was your uh \ninterest in diving in do you have any \nhesitancy on maybe the domain specific \nthing like debugging your Swahili model \nright it would be a little like \ndifficult \nyeah that's that's definitely hard to to \ndebug this \num first I would say there's like a big \nbig need for this so me as a German \nspeaker I mean it's always nice if I go \nto English there are like so many models \nand systems available but if you even if \nyou go to German and German I mean it's \nstill like a high resource language has \na decent amount of population \nit's quite powerful economically but \nstill the number of things you can get \nis like really limited and it's like \nreally \nfrustrating to see that in English you \ncan build these amazing semantic search \nsystems which works extremely good for Q \na retrieval but even if you go to German \nthere's like hardly any models available \nand then if you go further down the the \nlanguage letter to like more and more \nlow resource languages it's getting \nharder and harder to build this \nsecond motivation is \nmulti building multilingual search was \nlexical search is like really painful so \nif you build this \nin elasticsearch for example you need to \nknow the language \nso you need to know the language of the \ndocument \nfor every language you have like a \ndifferent index because every language \nrequires a different tokenizer requires \na different stopwatch list requires a \ndifferent stammer so at the end let's \nsay you want to Target I don't know \nEuropean Union was I don't know 20 \nlanguages you have like 20 different \nindices and elasticsearch everyone each \nhas like a different tokenizers demo \nstopwatch list \nfor each document you have to run \nlanguage identification to see is it a \nGerman document or a French document \nand then the Big Challenge comes at \nquery time is it like a German query or \na French query or an English query for \nsome really short queries it's like a \nbig it can be English and German or \nFrench and Spanish \nand so how do you query these different \nindices because the Spanish query you \nhave to add like a Spanish index and so \non \nwas extremely retrieval so you can have \njust you have just one index \nyou take your text you pass it through \nthe embedding model that gives you some \nin settings to pass it to your Dems to \nyour vector DB \nyou don't have to do any language \nidentification don't have to build \ndifferent indices don't have to do \ndifferent stemming and stop work list \nso it's like super easy to build like \ndensport tree with 500 languages which \nis like completely painful and possible \nbecause like lexical search \nhmm \nthat's super interesting I think the um \nyeah I thought the last I saw I saw a \nstrong hybrid search results on \nmultilingual I'm really not uh yeah it \nsounds the whole separate stuff whereas \nI you know I don't know what the stop \nwords are in Korean so it does I see how \nthat kind of domain \nuh shift sounds really uh challenging \nthem so I I kind of want to Pivot to \nsort of an idea I've just seen recently \nand get your opinion on it um this thing \nwas called this paper was called a task \naware retrieval with instructions where \nsort of the interface is in addition to \nthat search box you also explicitly \ndescribe your intent and then you have \nlike an embedding of the intent that you \nwould use to re-rank the candidates in a \nvector search way as well so what do you \nthink about that kind of idea because \nyou mentioned the problem of okay I \ngotta understand that this query is \nKorean or uh what's a neighboring \nlanguage I'm not I'm not like a great \nlanguage guy but like this idea of you \nexplicitly describe your intent as well \nyeah \nm \nM yes so so in the beer Benchmark we \nhave like one one data set which is \nreally interesting it's called abuana \nwhen you want to find counter arguments \nso you have an argument say nuclear \nenergy is super safe and then you want \nto have retrieval to find like counter \narguments to say okay no the energy is \nnot safe \nobviously out of the box models if I \nsearch for nuclear energy is safe finds \nlike different entries different \narguments also mentioned nuclear energy \nis one of the safest energy sources \nso so there are the questions like how \ncan I intend to tell them all of my \nintent that I don't want to have \narguments that are similar but arguments \nthat are opposing \nand the paper you mentioned we use this \nin terms of like kind of like instructor \nsay okay find like contact women nuclear \nenergy is safe or find a similar \nargument or find evidences \num \nI think yeah it's it's a nice idea \nespecially if people want to build this \ninto their product so so if you have \nlike search engine and you want to find \nsome arguments with supporting and \nopposing evidences \nand different perspective so I think \nit's like an easy way for machine \nlearning \nengineers and search engine Engineers \njust to prepare the prefix and say okay \nnow I want to search for posing \narguments or supporting evidence or \nopposing evidence for this \nyeah \num so I'm kind of there's a few I kind \nof want to stay on this idea of well I \nthink because we could go into like the \nkind of the prompting in the chat gbt \nand that idea of instructions and intent \nand the interface around it but I kind \nof want to stay on this like \nmulti-vector search like vector \nre-ranking uh have you had a chance to \nsee The Colbert idea and do you have any \nthoughts on it this kind of like you \nkeep token representations to re-rank in \na vector search way yes so yeah I'm \nquite familiar with coborn \num \nsay a code word is a nice idea \num \nso far challenge with code word is like \ndeployment costs so the idea of cohort \nis like you take a text and you don't \nencode to a single embedding but you \ntake every token and your method to like \nlike to an individual embedding and this \ngives you like kind of like an explosion \nof embedding so if you take a paragraph \nor summary tokens it's not resulting \nlike single embedding but to 100 \nembeddings \nand this down the line ex that's the the \ncost for the vector DB to be exploded so \nbecause the cost of vector DB is like \n100 times higher \nand this slide's really significant so \nif you want to do semantic search Vector \nsearch on English Wikipedia it's not too \nbig it's like I don't know 5 million \narticles but you pay like roughly two \nthousand dollars a month to run like AWS \ninstance on this \nif this is like 100 times higher so \nthat's like \num like 200k months to run like coverage \nlike out of the box non-optimized covert \nso search is not not only like finding \ngit system but always perfect trade-off \nlike good systems versus costs around \nthe search \nand here's like interesting to play \naround with like different parameters to \nsay okay for which setting which \nprovides like the optimal setting \noptimal trade-off between cost and \nperformance \num and I think here finding like generic \nanswers is like really hard to say okay \nI don't know code word is always better \nor Dent embeddings is better or spasm \nheadings is better because I think it \ncan also depend where you are do you \nhave like a small data set and one \nreally high quality then code word is \ngood if you have a massive data set \nuh and you're okay with somewhat good \nquality then covert is probably like way \ntoo expensive and you you have to use \nlike other approaches like binary \nembeddings \nthat yeah there's a lot a reason I'm \nstill reading this paper from uh \nChristopher Potts and and a big team I \njust remember that name but um about \nlike the the cost trade-offs of like \nsplayed the starting with bm25 is the \ncheapest thing and then like explain and \nthen they have this like played engine \nbehind Cobra but yeah I this General \ntopic around the cost of the search \nsystems is so interesting is where \nalleviate releasing uh like disk a n and \nthe vamana thing compared to h s w that \nhas the in-memory thing and uh you know \nthe product quantization these things \naround uh making it run let's say CPUs \ngpus I'm also very interested in a \ncompany called neural magic that's doing \nlike sparsity for the model acceleration \nthat whole topic is so interesting and \nuh so maybe transitioning um the last \ntime I heard you uh give this lecture uh \nit was a really great lecture cohere \ntalks um and you had four key points and \nI kind of want to walk through them and \nI think this would be \nso from uh Colbert I want to talk about \nuh sparse vectors I don't really I don't \nknow if Colbert is quite a sparse Vector \nidea it's kind of that idea where you \nhave like a representation of each token \nso I kind of want to talk about \num like bm25s Blade the this idea that \nyou have like a mass language modeling \nhead that projects the token into a \nsparse uh representation uh so can you \ntell me how you're thinking about \nsparsity these days \nm \num I like the split model I'm a big fan \nof it \num I really like it because it's like \nreally close to a mass language modeling \nso so the issue was dancing batting \nmodels if you train bird mom gives you \nlike really bad dance and batting models \nout of the box weaker than averaging \nword to wreck \nbut this mon objective display just like \nreally closed between like split and MLM \nyou could take a word you'll see okay \nwhat are possible synonyms here \nand then you put all these possible \nsynonyms for every token into like a \nsparse vectors so here you have like a \nreally close match between fine tuning \nand pre-training which is extremely nice \num also they have shown really strong \nresults like out of domain so big \nchallenge for density matting model is \nlike new words so people \ncreate like new new things like I don't \nknow chat GPT \num free Trend and some embedding model \nhas like no idea what it is but like \nFast models they just projected to like \nNew Dimensions you can search for it so \nas soon as you search search for it you \nfind it which is also a lot of issues \num topics which I'm really interested in \nwhich they certainly also don't solve as \nlike long document encoding so split \nworks on a paragraph level \nso so maybe up to a few hundred words \nbut in most cases you have like really \nlong documents like thousands tens of \nthousands of words I don't know in some \nindustry manufacturing centering you \nhave PDF documents of 10 000 Pages how \nto repair some I don't know machine \nand they're the question like how do you \ncan even kill these loan documents and \nsell it doesn't work with blade and also \ndoesn't in principle work with \nlike like spice Packers from Guiding my \nthinking with these four things I've \nkind of started to put long documents in \nmulti-discourse uh kind of together into \nthe same category where \nuh yeah I mean yeah long documents is \nsuch an interesting problem I think with \nthe chat gbt and like the dialogue \nmodels particularly it's making a lot of \npeople think about this \nso here's maybe what I've been thinking \nabout and I'm really curious what your \nthoughts are on this is um is sort of \nclustering the windows and then because \nyou embed the windows of the long \ndocument then you kind of cluster it and \nthen you have sort of a representative \ncentroid that you kind of try to pack \ninto the context window sort of and \nmaybe also in addition to you know the \nretrieving facts and it's some kind of \nprompt design to overcome the long \ndocument limitation yes I think here \nlike you need to differentiate between \nthese two things like more chat GPT \nwhere you operate on like some history \nand in terms of of retrieval so in terms \nof retrieval \num Big Challenge is kind of like \nco-references so if you take the annual \nreport from Apple \nyou just have like apple on the front \npage of the annual report so the annual \nreport is located on 200 pages long \nand then down the line on the paragraph \nlevel it just says we so instead of like \napple they just we you can't have a \nparagraph where they write like we saw a \nbig increase in demand for our products \nin this market \nand the other questions like what is we \nwhat is our products and what is this \nmarket and you as a human you know okay \nit's the Apple annual report you're in \nsubsection I don't know iPhone sales in \nNorth America \nand then you can fill in like the blanks \nbut they are the questions like how do \nyou fetch up this co-co ref well how do \nyou fetch up this information \num in chat GPT challenges \num \nhear what works so far is like \nincreasing the context lengths because I \ndon't know if you start a blank session \num it takes some time so if it has like \ncontext length of 8 000 so so right now \nthe best models can do like up to 8 000 \nwork pieces that's like eight pages so \nit takes a time until you write like \neight pages of organization with check \nGPT so you can just do massive attention \nfor tokens \nbut probably over a long time if you \nreally build up \nI don't know if you have like a lot of \ninteraction with systems we need to find \nways to to build up some type of memory \nso \nlike we do it with humans we know this \nperson I don't know has these Hobbies \nthis work these I don't know travel to \nthis location and then we can query this \nsomehow and use this in our current \ncontext so so ether we have to find like \nway to build up like some small memory \nwhich we can quickly \nofficially query what we have to do have \nto have select some query thing into it \nlike Okay \num \non what topic is the person working so \nso that I can create like a follow-up \nquestion on this but still that's I \ndon't know really I think really early I \nfeel like how can \na system quickly access memory and \nbuilds on top of this to get like new \nideas from past history \nyeah it's I mean the whole external \nTransformer memory idea is something \nthat we're just crazy excited about with \nweaviate and the you know the vector \nindex and all that but um I really quick \nI want to go a little deeper into this \nco-reference resolution it's it it \nsounds like such a problem and I think \nit \ncommunicates the idea well so like three \nparagraphs \neight pages well let's so in the context \nof retrieval models we'll say we can \nonly take in like two paragraphs as \ninput it's like four paragraphs to go it \nsaid like uh yeah apple is the and then \nwe are and then we use apple so does \nthat mean we maybe need like a \nco-reference resolution parser to parse \nour text before it's vectorized or do we \nmaybe need to create like a graph of \nedges the link yeah \num yeah that's that's good question \nwhere we're currently doing research on \nthat \num it says uh it depends kind of the the \ndata set so right now a lot of people \nwork on Wikipedia about Wikipedia is cut \nwhat kind of borrowing because it's like \nreally safe uh contained so if you take \na paragraph from Wikipedia I don't know \nyou take a random paragraph from the \nBarack Obama article it will mention \nBarack Obama so like every paragraph \nmentions Barack Obama \nbut in Android reports they I don't know \nApple just say we and then on the front \npage you know it's Apple annual reports \nyou go on page 100 here's the section \nabout I don't know iPhones a man's page \n150 years iPhone sales in North America \nand then you have the paragraph like we \nsaw a big increase for our products in \nthis market and so you kind of need to \ndo like co-reference resolution across \nlike many pages so potentially like \ngoing back 100 pages to know okay this \nis the Apple annual report from 21. \nand there's the question like how can we \ndo this because then we come back to \nlike a whole problem so right now all \npeople in co-reference resolution are \nmainly using Transformer networks which \nare again limited to like I don't know \n512 word pieces so but how can we do \nthis co-reference revolution possibly \nover like hundreds of pages and it's \nawesome I can really complex settings so \nthat we really know \num how to do it and yeah I think that \nthe best way if we chunk to paragraph \nand encode them is to really rewrite the \nparagraph so that if you just see the \nparagraph and nothing else you has all \nthe the relevant contacts information so \nif I rewrite like we saw a big increase \nin our products on this Market in the \nlast year and rewrite it to Apple so a \nlot of increase in demand for the iPhone \nand the North American Market in 2020. \nthen it's nice you can find it for a lot \nof search questions \nuh but yeah open questions like how do \nyou do this rewriting especially this \nrequires again to resolve long context \nresolutions \nyeah that's so interesting I think of \nthat as like a data augmentation maybe \nmore than a pre-processing because \nyou're kind of trying to encode the \ninvariance of uh the original paragraph \nWithout sorry the original paragraph \nWithout The co-references resolved and \nthen the new kind of like instead of we \nit's apple and then you're trying to say \nlike the invariant to these two \nTransformations and I think it's very \ninteresting is you kind of the problem \neats itself like the co-reference \nresolution models they also are limited \nto the context so yeah that's a pretty \ninteresting thing \num and then obviously we can also change \nlike I don't know maybe they have like \nsome subdivision and then we can mean I \ndon't know not only Apple but maybe I \ndon't know for Europe or so or some you \nhave like some parent company and then \nthere's like some \nuh child companies as a weekend refer to \nthe chai company or can it refer to the \nwhole group \nor to some product team so \nhave you thought about like um entity \nparsing entity extraction it's because \nit's a little different from the sparse \nsearch with the high with the hybrid the \nbm25 is like if the query is how to \ncatch an Alaskan pollock it's like it'll \nbe emphasizing the Alaskan pollock sort \nof with the keyword matching thing but \nthere's also this idea of like entity \nextraction Alaskan pollock and maybe \nit's that multi-vector ranking where you \nsearch with how to catch an awesome \nPollock and then you re-rank with just \nthe like Alaskan pollock \num \nyeah I mean that the researchers still \nreally are Valley in this field so \num big limitation as so far data sets \num a lot of data sets are built on \nWikipedia which does not really require \nto take a lot of contacts into account \nthen the question is it just entities or \nis it also other things what an entities \nso that's also like \nlike an open research question is it \njust fine to resolve like we and this \nand last quarter or do we have to also \nresolve other things and yeah in my \nexperience often in these I don't know \nthese these examples you make up like I \ndon't know we saw a big demand it's kind \nof easy but then if you go to actual \nsentences you say okay it's like a lot \nmore nuanced which context information \ndo you still need to understand this \nparagraph \num maybe context information can also \nmap to like a table with financial data \nit can map to some graph and then the \nquestion is like okay maybe they have \nlike some pie chart and they're \ndiscussing the pie chart how can you \ncontextualize the pie chart into this \nparagraph so that if you just encode the \nparagraph have all the necessary \ninformation \nand without running out of context links \nor Wetlands again \nyeah that's another really interesting \ntopic I think there's so many things to \ntalk about but like that idea of um the \ntables and the graphs and getting that \ninto the text domain it also it kind of \nreminds me of the same data augmentation \npre-processing we discussed with the \nco-reference where where you can parse \nthe tables like I've seen this paper on \nuh it's like learning to reason across \nWiki tables something some kind of like \nthat where they're parsing out the \ntables to go from table structure to \ntext structure uh and then because then \nyou kind of unify the domains without \nhaving to have like a visual uh \ncomponent to it yeah anyway so um \nanother topic uh kind of a finishing on \nthe four things is um \nuh so the topic of uh unknown words and \ndistribution shift um maybe kind of \nmaybe actually those are kind of two \ntopics with \num because uh maybe we'll start with uh \ndistribution shift because it's so \nexciting so uh I recently read this \npaper that was really interesting called \nOod disk a n where they're describing \nthe distribution shift and if you build \nup an image index and then you're \nsearching with the text queries they're \ngoing to be out of distribution for the \nh s w practice or the proximity graph \nstructure is the vamana but and that \nkind of idea so uh how are you thinking \nabout distribution shift these days yes \nso distribution shifts are \ninteresting on multiple aspects so \nlanguage evolves so so that's big \npain point of language or nice feature \nof language \nyou see that things evolving and meaning \nso I don't know like Corona before 2020 \nit was like many beer then selling in \n2020 if someone talks about Corona it's \nconnected to a virus \nsimilar if you talk about like alphabet \nor amicron it used to be some Chinese \nand some Greek characters maybe relevant \nformat method mathematical questions \nnow people talk about yeah there's like \na new Omicron wave in in Europe or stuff \nlike that or there's a new Army Corps \nenvironment \nwhere it's like extremely hard to \nto really update the models here \nand a big challenge is also \num in terms of like first stage and \nsecond stage review also so if you take \nan embedding model that's like no idea \nabout Corona virus maybe on new training \ndata you can update the model that \nCorona now has a new meaning \nbut then you come back to need to think \nabout like do you need to re-encote your \nwhole Corpus so you do you have to take \nthe embedding model and re-encol like \nthe whole Corpus \nif your Corpus is more like a million \ndocuments it's okay what if your Corpus \nis the web like Google or Bing \nyou have to re-encore like all documents \non the web \njust to create like the new embeddings \nand so there's like an interesting thing \nor question like okay \ncan you make this a bit more efficient \nso which can you kind of like \ntransform the embedding so do can you do \nlike some partial updates so do you can \njust update that Corona now has like two \nmeanings the beer and the virus and can \nyou find like the documents you want to \nupdate but everything else you can keep \nthe same \num \nbe able to decide when do you do the \nupdates or when do you train again this \nnew embedding model and so on \num so so many many open on soft research \nquestions here right now people do like \nthe most stupid thing they completely \nupdate their betting model and then \nencode the whole Corpus again \neven such that 99 Prime percent are \ncurrently attached from from the update \nso so exciting research questions to \nknow okay what do you need to update and \nhow can you update this and also there \nthe interplay between first and second \nstage \nso maybe it's okay to have like an \noutdated free stage retrieval that does \nnot really know what is Corona but then \nhave like a more recent up-to-date \nsecond stage retrieval that and also \nCorona can also \nuh Nina virus now and not only beer yeah \nI thought what you just said was \nincredibly inspiring uh because there \nwas this argument about with the whole \nlike uh we V8 augmented gbt thing where \nit's like um you know the big language \nmodel doesn't need it can be updated for \nthese new facts by retrieving it but \nthen it's like well what about the \nretrieval model and and it that and then \nthere's that problem of you retrain the \nretrieval model on the new information \nlike the new omnic uh omnicron uh \nvariant and then um and then you have to \nre-encode and the whole document and if \nyou have like you know hundreds of \nmillions or whatever and we thought \nabout this idea that is kind of \ninteresting that I'd like to pitch to \nyou as well as like uh like maybe we \ncould use that proximity graph structure \nas of prior to try to propagate the \nrepresentation space changes and and \nthat way \nwe can maybe only re-vectorize like 10 \n000 documents and it could be they could \nbe kind of cleverly selected with their \nkind of centrality in the proximity \ngraph and then we could maybe have some \nsort of graph neural network that could \npropagate representation changes I know \nthis is too grandiose of an idea of uh \nwhat do you think about that idea \num \nI think they're there you quickly run in \nthe problem or the challenge to know \nwhat has changed so so let's say what \nhas changed in 2022 \nand then maybe for some top things you \ncan name it \nbut it's like really hard in the long \ntail to say okay what has changed my \nother like new and some new online games \npopular online games they're like some \nnew patch which introduces new \ncharacters which have like a new acronym \nand now and one refers to them as like a \ndifferent acronym or so \nso I think that's like \nthe the challenge like really what has \nchanged between now and the year before \nand to really enumerate this to \nnot only say okay not only like I don't \nknow Corona change the meaning but like \nreally in the long tail what has all \nchanged the meaning and where do you all \nneed to do the update \num I think that's that's the biggest \nchallenge how to automate this and how \nto find it \num also in terms of preferences \num if I \nsearch for like how can I get Corona in \ntheory \nhow I catch the virus and how I catch or \nhow I buy the beer should both be \nrelevant so if you ask like an annotator \nthey should both be annotated as \nrelevant \nbut probably if you see a search in like \nCorona and people say how do I get \nCorona you probably want to rank the \nvirus higher than the beer and then \nmaybe hopefully in a few years you want \nto rank the BR high again \nbut there \nyeah I also the question like how do you \nbuild up this popularity so it's not \nonly relevancy in search but also in \npopularity of terms like \num nft popped up at some point for \nnon-fungible tokens so if someone search \nfor nft we're meaning unfundable tokens \nbut there were meanings for nft before \nso so there's like a book series Not For \nTourists also every related with nft \nso how can you learn okay there's like a \nnew meaning which is a lot more popular \nalso crypto I started myself to work on \ncryptography so crypto 10 years ago you \nreferred to cryptography then Bitcoin \nand and uh and so on happen and now if \nyou talk about crypto everyone talks \nabout like Bitcoin and stuff so yeah I \nthink um in this well yeah this idea of \nkind of updating the unknown words it \nsounds it sounds pretty difficult and I \ndon't even have anything to kind of \npropose but that's kind of why I also \nreally like this intent stating as well \nin the search engine interface where uh \nhow to catch Corona and then maybe if \nyou just said your intent like I'm \nlooking for beer I it's like a different \nway to search and it's more verbose than \nusual but if it gives you better results \nmaybe especially especially with like \nthe kind of the idea that search \ninterfaces are moving into like \ngenerating you a long answer instead of \njust necessarily returning documents uh \nand maybe you'd be willing to put more \neffort into your query I think generally \nthe search interfaces uh thing is \nevolving um yeah maybe you kind of yeah \nI want to ask you a question question \nabout search interfaces really quick \nlike um \njust a second one on this intent I mean \nit's kind of old ideas like I don't know \nbefore that it was named query rewriting \nI mean we as a human do it like I don't \nknow if I search for Corona I get the \nwrong results I search for Corona beer \nso we already trained on this \num I search for like how to sort a list \nand I forgot which programming language \nI add like python to it and then also in \nthe back end like I don't know even when \nGoogle was created was smartly adding \nquery writing to it so when I look for I \ndon't know like an Italian restaurant it \nwas adding smartly in the background the \nprogram location I'm in and we're \nlooking for like Italian restaurant in \ntimestarter so \nit's kind of like an old technique this \nthis query rewriting heading trying to \nguess the intent and adding it \nyeah that's super I I saw this like \nlearning to reformulate queries with \nreinforcement learning where the action \nspace is are the keywords and then you \ncan add them subtract them boost the \nimportance of them uh yeah yeah it's \nsuper quiet I guess I'm kind of uh \nlosing interest in that idea due to the \nchallenge of maybe a reinforced and \nlearning query writer it sounds like a \nlot of overhead in the in the search \npipeline thing yeah that's true \nyeah so interesting uh so anyways Nils \nuh thank you so much for joining the \nweekday podcast I think we covered so \nmany interesting topics I'm really \nlooking forward to re-watching this and \nyou know rethinking about all these \nideas \num thanks so much for your contributions \nto search broadly yeah and I'm really \nloving these uh cohere talks you're \ngiving I think you're doing another one \nin about an hour and uh so I'll see you \nover there and I'm really looking \nforward to it and thanks again great \nthank you so much for being here bye bye \n",
