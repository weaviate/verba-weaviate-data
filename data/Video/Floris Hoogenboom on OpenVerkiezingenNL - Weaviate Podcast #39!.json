{"text": "Check out the website here! https://openverkiezingen.nl/ Chapters 0:00 Intro 2:35 Developer Experience with Weaviate 4:12 ... \nhey everyone we have a pretty uniqueepisode of the wevia podcast today wewelcome Flores hoogenboom who's builtthis website using weeviate thatorganizes information about the Dutchelections so you ask it questions likesay Highway construction and it uses thesemantic search technology withadditional filters across the differentparties and overall this is a superinteresting technology and in thepodcast we're going to discuss allthings from the technical details of howthis is constructed the use of leviatesemantic search embeddings as well astechnology like summarization with chatgbt and multilingual you know processingDutch Tech so I really hope you enjoythe podcast we also conclude with somediscussions around bias especiallyimportant for applications like this soI hope you enjoyed this podcast and Ireally hope you check out the websiteespecially if you're in the Netherlandsthanks so much for watching hey everyonethank you so much for watching anotherepisode of the weeva podcast I'm superexcited to welcome Flores to the podcastFlores is building something superinteresting with weaviate and a prettynovel application of alleviate soflorist thank you so much for joiningthe podcast yeah nice to be here Connoruh love it awesome so can you dive rightinto it and tell us about uh yourproject of alleviate yeah sureum so this is something that alreadyum uh was on my mind and a few other uhopen source Fanatics with me uh for acouple of years of doing somethingum around parliamentary electionsum and data or AIum and usually every year we had thatidea a month before the election startedthat we thought debit again too late butthis time we were we were in time andwhat we have been working onum is basically a tool that allows usersto exploreum party manifestos of the the the thethe the political parties in the taxparliamentary electionsum and we do it basically in a third oftwo stage first of all we allow them toexplore so find out what's in there butI don't know about you did you ever readparty manifestos yeah in the US it's abit different but it's a lot of textuh no me personally nowfor me and I'm even though uh quitepolitical information in that senseum because it's just too much text andtoo much text to make sense of so whatwe do on top of that is not only allowsearching for those party manifestos butalso allows summarizationum so okay you type in a statement Ithink thatum the Netherlands should invest more inartificial intelligence of course I doumum and it will give you a summary ofwhat each party thinks about thatstatement you just entered hmmyeah that's super cool the use of thesummary thing is so interesting as welland um so so I'm very curious about justthe kind of sort of maybe we could startwith the technical requirements like thekind of developer experience of gettingthe data into weeviate and like kind ofwhat your experience with that part ofit was yeah sure yeah so so uh I met Bobum from my uh daytime professionbasically a couple of years ago uh Ithink way before the investment that youguys hadum and it was always on my mind I wantto do something with this software anduh for me itum it really started during Christmasplaying around for a little bitexploring the RPMum andum basically it was pretty smoothactuallyum getting it up and running with uhwith the docker files uh or the dockercompose setup uh you guys providedumum and basically from that just buildout this idea and once we get to a pointwhere we thought hey this this might isgonna work uh I reached out to Bob likehey can we do a collaboration on thisbecause this is this is cool this ishelping democracy this is a AI for goodbasicallyum and then which should we aviate Cloudserves and it was actually a prettysmooth process in In from from adeveloper's perspective it was prettyhands-off uh we started locally with anice local setup and once we had there-av8 cloud service our productionsetup basically was just uh uh uh yeahit it was just changing URLs and tokensbasicallysuper amazing it's something else I'mreally curious with this application islike how do you feel about theperformance of the embedding models likewhen you're doing are you how are youevaluating the quality of the searchwhat does that kind of thing look likeyeah so that that it it is of courseum a tricky topic to apply AI in itum andumwe have banished all over the websitesindicating hey this might be wrong andthis is not contended as an advice foryou guys to which where what you shouldvote it's only intended to show hey AIin the future might also play a role inthis uh so we're not trying to replaceumany parties you have in the Netherlandsfor example likethat's basically the site which prepstatements then allows you toum to answer to answer your own positionon the statement that gives you anadvice for us it's really about showingwhat AI can do if you look at theembeddingsum we we think the quality is is quitegoodum we noticed a few thingsum we're doing this in Dutchso most of the Corpus isn't trained onthat language of course still works outpretty decent uh abbreviations Etcthat's where it becomes a bit difficultbut what we also did isum we don't we we ask users to help us abit and what we do in that sense is whenyou enter a statement we find the threenearest paragraphs in uh in Vector spaceand then we ask you as a user hey wethink your answer might be in one ofthose in one of those chapters which onedo you think matches best and with thattwo-stage approachum we've been able to get pretty decentresults thereso is that two-stage approach like maybeuh because we have this we've beenthinking about this idea around likewe've made in this other technologycalled gbt index where they have like ahierarchical summary so are you firstsearching through a summary of so Iimagine these are these long uh likelong statements of uh party preferencesand so you first have these summariesand then which summary you like thattakes you then into the document whereyou then find a more fine-grainedparticular to the party is that acorrect understanding or no no it's it'sit's way simpler than thatin that sense so we we just indexed theum the sections of uh so each paragraphof the uh of the party manifestos that'salso where we evaluate embedding zone soyour short statement the embedding ofthat and the paragraph but what we do iswe don't Reserve return a single resultand then say hey this is it but weprompt the user okay we found threeresults which because if you look atthis party manifestos if they talk aboutfor exampletrade agreements yet it might be abouttrade agreements within the EuropeanUnion that might be about trade agreeagreements with the US that might beabout brexitum so there's there's a lot of new onesthereum and that's why we thought okay wewon't return a single answer but ratherwe return them to three most relevantchapters and then let the user figureout okay based on the title of thatchapter I think that this is the onewhich will answer my statement andum that that also means we we have touse to help the system a bit to figureout the right uh the right answervery cool so it's like um it's like theuser interface is designed in a way tocollect the data and um yeah so I guessI was a little confused on kind of theunderstanding the two-stage process ofthat so once you click it what it thentakes you into the full article so sortof like uh like a web URL in a way yeahso so what happens is you enter yourstatementum then you say okay I wanna I I want toknow what this party so take for examplethe the uh the the Democratic uh partyin the Netherlands uhumum uh what what does what does it thinkabout this statement then we'll give youthree options you'll select the chapterand from that it takes you into the fulltext that we indexed of that chapterum with references to where you can findit on theum on the party's websiteand on top of that we offer you theoption then toum use a sort of chat gpt-like model andto summarize okay what does this pieceof text say about my statementumuh super cool yeah so so that data fromthe first uh search query and then threeresults do you use that data to thencompare models with each other or I'mjust curious if that kind of interestingat the moment we don't and that's justpurely because of lack of time becausewe have all kinds of interesting ideasalso what you can do of course with thisespecially also thosestatements that we collectthat's super interesting information toknow hey what's what's going on insociety basically which teams peoplefind interesting so we collectstatistics about each statement howoften it has been searched there we alsouse we aviate of course because it'sfree text entry and if you search forthe Netherlands should leave Europe orthe Netherlands should you use to leavethe European Union you probably probablymean the same although the former iseffectual impossible butum we we then try also try to do someanalytics on that by merging similarstatements together CA which which arethe themes that pop up which are theteams that people find interesting uhwhat are the parties that people areinterested for in those in those teamsso that is basically also the follow-upthat we'll give to this after theelectionnot onlyumhelping people figure or yeah scrollthrough those programs a bit more butalso get some insight into hey what'swhat's going on which are the big themesactually that people find interestingyeah it's amazing it reminded me ofanother Dutch uh scientist who came onthe podcast was uh Martin grutendorfsaid I hope I've got that last name uhright uh and he has this tool calledBert topic that I think is superinteresting with what you're justdescribing where what you do is you uhcluster all the statements in the vectorspace and then you have the vectorclusters and then you do TF IDF on theClusters to have the unique keywords toeach of the Clusters so it would be likeyou know I don't want to start gettinginto the political topicsyeah so a super interesting way ofDiscovery so another question withrespect to Wavy that I was reallycurious to ask you about was the use ofthe symbolic filters so uh like as maybeto set this up like I've been playingaround with this podcast search progressa project so like with our conversationright now I'm going to embed thetranscript and put it in like search toit and you can have symbolic filterslike uh you know where speaker equals uhyou know Martin grutendors and then Ican and then I ask my question with thatsymbolic filter uh do you so how are youthinking about like kind of the extrametadata that goes around the text andthat kind of thinking I think for usthat's super important so what we do iswe storeall paragraphs basically in in one bigindex but we also store that with theinformation like okay which party saidthatum what is the chapterthe chapter here and we're thinking inthe future maybe we want to enhance ourshirts but also uh adding some somecommon themes like hey this is sort ofkeywords that we uh that we see thereum but what we do is you if you retrieveinformation from a single party we douse those filters to only do the filterbefore search basically uh I think youguys call itumand we first filter okay which the partythat we're interested in andsubsequently we we then use theum the embedding index the vector indexbase need to figure out okay whichparagraphs of this party are areinterestingumso it does limit Us in for exampleumum we can't yet use the hybrid Churchwhich combines sparse and and denseVector search which would be I think anenormous performance improve Improvementfor a lot of the things becauseum a lot of keywords that probably nowaren't in the in the in the vocabularyof our embeddies or aren't that commonin that sense likeum uh in the in Dutch you got aabbreviation it's called Uh AOW which isuh for for pension uh basically uh andthat is something yeah if you search upon it and you do the embedding justpurely dense dense comparison youprobably won't find it because it's it'sso rare in that Corpus that thoseembeddings don'tum don't really pick it up so we'restill uh hoping that at a certain pointwe might be able to use the hybridchurch so with dense search combinedwith filters uh because we think thatwe'll be uh we'll enable us to give waymore relevant results than we're alreadydoing now and maybe even get rid of thattwo-stage approach and everything youshould still select their own uhparagraph there hmm yeah that's supercool that idea of like the thinkingabout how do you add the AOW token to adense embedding model I find to be veryinteresting like whether you can justkind of add a new token to thevocabulary and just do a little bit offine tuning on these uh you know onthese texts and whether that can correctit but yeah the hybrid search and thehybrid search adding the wear filtersthe UVA 118 feature that I hope peopleare interestedso so one other question I wanted to askabout and I've been thinking a lot aboutthe role of like potentially crossencoder re-ranking weba where basicallyyou search and then you have this highcapacity scoring model that re-ranks theresults but the trade-off is sort ofspeed and I'm curious like with yourapplication how important do you thinkspeed is to the user experience ofsearchumum I I I I tend to say is superimportant but I think for for ourapplication and the bottleneck alsoisn'tum uh isn't we aviate because if youlook at the size of our indexum it's pretty small like the effortspart in Manifesto is I think 200 uh 200Pagesum embedding that in paragraph So Ithink that if we if we haveum like 5 000 objects in in the effectspace that that it's already a lot inthat sense so the bottleneck for us isreally Computing those embeddings[Music]um I I haven't tried we aviate on a uhon a larger uh section that's somethingthat we're now thinking about is whatwould be really cool is if you can usethis technology on uh not transcripts ofthis podcast it would also be prettygood cover but uh on transcripts of whathappens in Parliamentum what does your elected representativereally say in Parliament after he'selected about the teams that areimportant and I think that is somethingwhere I even feel that that if you talkaboutAI for good AI helping democracyum that that I would love to see wherethis is going and then also explore howthat how that index grows because that'sway more data than we're prostitute nowum because that takes out the role of ofcolored media basicallyand really makes it factual okay whatwhat what what was said about this teamnot how did we frame it in the mediawith what was said about it andum I think that is an interesting rolewhere this technology can help reallyfor uhum yeah making democracy moretransparent in that senseyeah it's a super a super impactfulapplication I think and um yeah sort ofthis truthful thing inspired me to startthinking a little bit more about theidea of the chat qbt summarization andthere's kind of this idea of like uhadding prompts that say please cite yoursources or something like that so uhwhen you're you know you've come intothe text and now you're using thesummarization model do you how do youthink about then citing the sources withthe summary that's produced yeah soum it's it's something we've beendebating a lot of whether we want thechat GPT summary in there or we wouldsay well we we now just stick withfinding the right paragraph becausethat's factual and the chat GPT issomething that can go okay that canhallucinatea bitum we opted for doing itum mainly because our goal now is notum to have the most factual platform butrather to to Showcase hey at this momentthe technology is not there but this iswhat AI will be doing for you in uh inthe future so that's also how wecommunicate about this we'll we'll neversay where we have 100 the right answereverything is filled with banners heythis might be wrong if you really wantthe true answer look look at theparagraph uh read itumumbut it is something that we also put alot of effort into in figuring out okayum what kind of promptum do we ask uhchatibility there and something that wefound out that works really nice nicelyI think we've seen those examples of GPTgoing wrong and like okay what isum with those riddles basicallyum Bob's Brothers called uh blah blahblah and his mother is this and then GPTconfidently giving the wrong answer butwhat was interesting if you ask jet GPTnot to give you the answer but to giveyou the reasoning why why before youcome up with those arms you generallyget better results so that promptengineeringum where we ask Chachi hey what doesthis Source think about this statementand please cite the sentences that madeyou come to these conclusions and ifthere aren't any relevant sentences uhindicate that you can't give the answerthat kind of prompts helped us to getthis to a level where at least we thinkokay it's good enough for this demoum and um this is this is not not hardscience yeah comparing this but in ourin our testsum out of 100 statements we had onewhere we told hey this this might not beuh the proper uh proper result thereum sonot there yet but uh interesting toshowcasethere's a couple things that maybequickly on the idea the prompting um oneof the examples Erica recently publisheda lang chain review demo and one of thefirst examples was this uh you know itanswers a question and then you followup by taking the answer as input andsaying what were the assumptions youmade when answering this question andthen like that is the input to based onthese assumptions do you still agreewith this answer and this kind ofchaining and the ability of thatparticular way to reduce Hallucinationis really interesting um but then youended with saying something that reallygot my interest um so so you're lookingat the summaries from cha gbt andannotating uh you know is this ahallucinationyeah so soum and and we don't do this uh largescale yeahum but we thought before we feelconfidently enoughumto to put this out in the open basicallyif you want to have an idea of thequality so what we did we prepped a setof around 50 statementsgot the results from the whole chainumuh what what would be the output of thatsummary and then labeled that hey do wethink this is uh okay or do we thinkthis is completely uh uh completely offbut once again that's really aqualitative answer to a very difficultquestion I thinkyeah I've been so I they have these kindof like quantitative abstractivesummarization metrics like the Rougescore Blues score these are they'rebasically like engram overlap metricscompared to some ground truth summary ofthe things so in like let's say you'resummarizing like a scientific paper youcould use like the abstract is kind oflike that ground truth and compare thesemetrics is there any kind of like groundtruth summary from one of thesestatements that that and then I guessthat would be one question but maybe thebigger question is from your use caseperspective would those metrics beinteresting to you as a way to kind ofablate the prompts ablate the chainsablate like the way that it's doing thesummeryeah I I don't know enough about thosemetrics to really judge that uh I needto admitumbut what would be very interesting forus and that's that's also something thatwe will be looking at into the futurelike like I said we have those electionAIDS basicallyum which are tools that that people readthrough all those programs then positionparties onum uh on on a set of statements do theyagree with do they partially agree withit do they disagree with thisum and they do that in a reallyscientific mannerwhich is a sort of peer review theparties themselves review it and there'sa lot of trust building that goes intouh into debtumwhat would be very interesting of coursealso once this technology progresseshereum to seek a sort of a hybrid formbetween thatum so where we've put a lot of effortinto placing those parties knowing whatthey think knowing what the conclusionshould be and this and more open-endeduh uh okay what what do we generate asthose uh as those conclusions so thatmight be something for in Europe we havethe European elections coming up uh nextyear which is by the way a veryinteresting case because they're stilldebating whether you can also vote forparties from other European countriesumum and why that's interesting becausethey're also the language aspectcompared to play of course but thatmight be something where at a certainpoint we hope that technology might haveevolved then and where we can try thingslike this uh can try things like thisout a bit moreyeah the the language jump is somethingthat I I think is an extremely emergingtopic of this technology um like forexample we've been working with coheresmultilingual embedding models and thesethese are like really good embeddingsfor multilingual and uh yes I'm curiouswell maybe saying on the summarizationthing do you like hugging face had thismodel called Bloom which was like amultilingual language model and I'm justcurious if maybe in addition to chat gbtif you've tried some of these otherlarge language models that maybe havebeen trained on Dutch and are donebetter at it no not not not yet and thatwould be really something thatum if we would go that relative of thatEuropean elections uh by the time thatwould of course be very interesting toexplore because then you get partymanifestos that might be in French butGerman citizen can vote for a Frenchparty I've been I'm pretty sure he wantsto know before he casts his vote on uhwhat's in that Manifesto then so thenyou're not only getting Dutch results inthat sense butyour your searching for a statement inDutch or in German maybe you're gettinga result in Frenchthat summarizing it again uh towards uhuh to work German or Dutch or whateverso I'm not sure about whether I woulddare that with the current quality butit is an interesting Chain of Thoughtbasically how this this can also helpyeah makeum uh make a lot of sources that aren'tin your native language searchable andand easier easier to explore basicallyyeah so interesting and when I wastalking to Nils rhymers from cohereabout this he had mentioned that uh likeone approach would be like you take theGerman and French and you translate itback to English and then and then youkind of can just have it all in Englishwhere like the model has you know butthen he described that there are thesethings like um that then you get a verylike U.S Centric view of the world likeif you translate how do I do my taxes inGermany back to English it like doesn'treally work like thatso would you think about fine-tuning oneof these language models on your uh onlike a newer textthere's another idea yeah yeahum it is something we now thought aboutof for for the these embeddings wedidn't do that because sheer lack oftime and uh resource uh basicallyumum[Music]but I'm not sure how that would workwith with translations basically yeahum because I think that that's where thebig challenge isum if you if you read political textsit's all about nuances it's it's it'snot about the general theme but it'sabout the tone of voice in certainum and I think factual translation isone but also translating these thingslike okay how does this sound how doesthis feel uh which are pretty importantactually for getting the meaning of uhof something yeahumyeah I'm I'm not sure if if thetechnology will be there uh will bethere yet and if you would then do finetuning then you need to have ittranslated party Manifesto there whereyou also won't probably have thatreviewed so I think that that would be alot of effort basically uh I'm notsaying it can't be done I'm not sayingit will not be done in the future but Idon't think it's it's we're there yetyeah that's a that's a reallyinteresting point you bring up on umlike embeddings can capture differentkinds of relationships so like the yeahlike the factual relationship or thetone relationship think about it this alot as well there's there are thesepapers that are coming out like taskSquare retrieval with instructions andinstructor where basically theembeddings it like depends on the theylike add intent it's almost likeprompting for embeddings as well whereyou say like if you're searching for astack Overflow like you might say I'msearching for another question comparedto I'm searching for the answer directlybut yeah this kind of like embeddingsbeing able to capture different kinds ofmeanings uh but I guess I was actuallycurious about the idea of fine-tuningthe language model rather than theembeddings um like like because I thinkwith the summarization or like just theidea of continuing the language modelingon the Dutch text would that kind ofthing sound like something that would beuseful for this case like I'm thinkingabout trying to improve thatsummarization modelyeahit might be it is something we thoughtaboutumum again uh did it didn't do it uh yetbut uh if if somebody's listening who'swho's happy to cookfor a lot of volunteers to help thisthing outumyeah I'm thinking about it what what itwouldwhat it would doumwithbasically doesn't it get too colored inthat sense and that also it depends Ithink on how you how you train that whatkind ofum and if you look at those partymanifesters they all have a verydifferent tone uh in that sense but alsothe Corpus isn't that large so I'm I'mreally curious okay will you get a sortof average political tone from from thatum and what that would do with thereadability of your summaries will theybe very politically like long sentencesuh hard to read Because what I like nowand what's I think strength of this isthat it also translates it to a prettyneutral language and I'm I'm curiouswill you keep that neutral languageum if you would if you would fine-tuneum and it depends on the extent the thethe extent to which you fine tune but ifyou would find tune based onumum these manifestos maybe maybe if youwould fine tune it based on manifestosand media coverage of the elections EtcI think that would be a more interestingconcept to me like also take newspaperarticles take what's written online taketranscripts ofumum of debates uh Etc if you collect acorpus like that I think this might thismight workyesit's really inspired me to think aboutthe whole like because the role of biasin language models is something that'sbrought up a lot and this applicationparticularly seems pretty important forthat and yeah I almost think like maybethe user interface like you type in ayou know the question and then it shouldhave like I don't know the view is likestatement from each of the partiesrather than like just like a ranked listhow we're used to seeing search resultsbut yeah how do you think about thatkind of bias in this problemyeah I think it is a huge issueum I I don't think we have any idea towhich extent uh that issue is is here soI think that's one of the big factorswhy why I alsoumeverywhere I talk about this whetherit's tomorrow will be on National radiobasically andum uh everywhere I say this is notintended as an election advice this isintended to Showcase what the technologyuhcan do and will be able to do and in thefuture uh it might be uh uh might be abit of advice we thought aboutcollecting user feedback there okayum uh on okay what what whatum how does this summary sound to youumum do you think this summary agrees withthe view of the party that is stated butwe were a bit afraid forumum basically data pollution there ofpeople who enter a statement uh look itup for the party they will never vote onand then uh click no this is this iswrong this is wrong this is wrong notanswering the question that was therebut rather expressing their politicalopinion uhopinion there so we we didn't do thatbut would be really interesting to alsohave this in a sort of controlledsetting whereumwe really have guidelines okay how howdo we label these things here and um howdo we identify bias but that'sum there is something that takes awaymoreor it takes away different expertise Ithink than only the tech expertise wehave here but then also uh requiresexpertise frompolitical sciences or for example acollaboration like I just mentioned withone of those election eight in theNetherlands that have a whole process ofuh getting from these manifestos to uhpositions on the on statement but it'sit's really interesting to think aboutthis uh going forwardyeah for sure yeah I mean the the roleof but I mean it yeahI really have two I don't have too muchexpertise on bias in the whole thing butyeah it's like there's obviously thisamazing technology of you know we cannow semantically search through all theeverything written every conversationall that and then there's like the wellis the search embeddings or the languagebut language model like bias towards onepolitical view and therefore it's gonnakind of only match the results thatmatch the underlying model and I thinklike kind of the you know the auditingtools that you know people like you whoare building these applications I thinkall that will be really important so soyeah cool I mean it's but it is superexciting yeah yeah and it's also on howyou define bias yeah because I sometimeshave these discussions professionallylikebut bias free ml but basically thereason why certain ml works isbecause it's it's biased only it'sbiased on uh attributes we think it'sokay to be biased all day it's it's it'sit's it's it's biased on a certainfeatureit gives it the power so it's also awhole discussion like okay what what dowe find acceptable there and if this forexample would would be if the same biasas any newspaperum uh because I'm I'm not advocatinghere against all media absolutely notbut every news Outlet of course has someform of bias in itum sometimes more profound than thanother timesumum but that's something we generallythink is is okay or at least in certainparts of society agree on that that thatis that is sort of yeah therepresentation of the truth so it's it'sreally interesting to think about okayum how does bias affect this and whenwhen is that an issue uh in that sensebut that's more societal discussion Ithink Dennis is a technological uh uhone to be honestyeah I definitely agree that it's like ahand-in-hand thing I think from thetechnology perspective I can maybe speaka little bit about uh machine learningthere's this problem called classimbalance where you know just from thebasic classifier sense if you'reclassifying cats and dogs and your dataset is 80 dogs and 20 cats you know it'sgonna it's gonna be really biased atpredicting dogs and that's like andthat's especially a problem with likeyou know like medical patient outcomeprediction where it's like usually thepatient survives but like sometimes theyexpire in the window and then you havethis like bias so you use like you knowPrecision recall f-score metrics thingslike that but so like even in thecontrastive learning and bettinglearning if most of the techs have thisone political view it's more likely tomatch the query and the optimizationobjective and therefore it's less likelyto like you know if you have this likeradical new idea it's less likely tomatch that just because it's less likelyin the training set just from thetechnical perspective that's how I cansee that yeahyeah it's an interesting topic and it'sit's a topic thatum I I don't think we fully covered uhyeah that as a as a Tech Community butalso as aas a society yeah what what do we findacceptable and I always make the examplealso ofum if if people professionally talk tome about buyers in ml then I also alwaysrefer to the Dutch pension scheme whereum everybody pays a certain the sameamount and from us from a fixed age youget uh the same page but I pay the sameamount as as women I'm not advocatingthat we should do this Liberty but justto illustrate how difficult it isalthough uh women have a a longer lifeexpectancy of around three years so youmight say well it's it's if you talkabout fairness yeah is it is it fairthat uh men statistically live shorterbut hence relatively pay more for theirpension scheme and I think this issomething where we as Society say and ahit's not an issue and if probably peoplewill be laughing at me now for forbringing this up but it's really aboutwhat do you define as buyers and what doyou accept as as bias and unfairnessEtc your algorithms rather than it is atechnical discussion like how do we makeum our features or tokenol or how do wemake yeah that's that's a means to anend but that still then is okay whatwhat do I accept as uh uh things wherewhere it can be biasedyeah it's I mean it's such aninteresting uh application of thetechnology I can see like umyou know like if we say like theextractive question answering modelsthat classify the answer within thecontext that has a low risk of bias Ithink because it's kind of like groundedin it whereas like the Chachi BT to likesummarize or like chat with youbasically like the one application isyou turn Chat obviously it is a chat botto begin with and and you retrieve tohave it supplement its context as youchat with it and it might probably likethe political bias of chat gbt mightcome into play as it's reading thatretrieved context and telling andspeaking with you so I imagine that aswell as I imagine just kind of searchresults in general sort of yeah I kindof like that idea of the user interfacethat takes you to each of the viewsrather than just like a ranked list justthink about it for the first time butlike that kind of way and yeah soflorist is super interesting speakingwith you you're working on a superinteresting problem and it's such anexciting application the technology sothank you so much for joining thepodcast and for you know discussingthese ideas of them yeah cool let's uhled to be here and a nice
