{"text": "Recorded presentation of Weaviate during the Machine Learning conference Conf42. Laura Ham tells you about Weaviate: open ... \nhi everyone welcome to my presentation of the vector search engine weaviate i'm laura home i'm a community solution engineer at semi technologies and in this presentation i will introduce you to our open source factor search engine we evade first first let's take a look at data and particularly about unstructured data unstructured data are forms of data that are not organized in a predefined manner take for example big pieces of text we learned that 93 percent of your data state stays unused and is unstructured and that 80 percent of businesses don't know how to use their unstructured data in favor of their business why is this so difficult what's so difficult about unstructured data one thing that is difficult is searching through unstructured data for example to answer business questions let me give you an example a simple example of searching through unstructured data if you want to find information from unstructured text you will need to use exact matching of keywords to find an answer if you look for example for a wine that fits with your seafood dinner well wine in your database only tells you that it is good with fish you will most likely not find this wine if you instead use a vector and search engine like vvate you can find information in unstructured data based on semantics compare this with google search if you ask google a very abstract question it might find an answer the question here what color of wine is chardonnay is very abstract still google search finds exactly this answer from a particular data node so the question is how does google find exactly this answer from exactly this data node and how can we predict the relation between this answer and the question that we asked and in addition how can we do this so fast so the main question here is uh yeah what could you what if you could do the same with your own data in a simple and secure way so the answer that we came up with is weaviate wev8 is a database that uses machine learning to understand the data that is in it so eviate is a cloud native modular real-time vector search engine that is built to scale your machine learning models so as i said wavy 8 is a vector search engine so first let's dive in what vector search actually is we evade stores data as vectors which are placed in a space in relation to other data objects machine learning models are used to compute a vector for each data object and also for each semantic query so we vvat really tries to understand your data and your queries in more detail this is how vv8 works with a text factorization module a pre-trained model for example a fast text or bird transformer model can compute vectors from known concepts this is for example our daily human language you can add your own data to aviate instance and all these data will be vectorized using these machine learning models and be placed as vectors and uh with their own data object into v8 the re the data objects will just be indexed by the machine learning models and be placed in the high dimensional vector space then you can perform for example a search query which will also be factorized using machine learning models of vv8 for example let's find a wine that fits with seafood we v8 computes does near a similarity search and find the objects that lies nearest to your search vector so the answer that lies closest to the vector of this question will be returned with viviate you can do the following tasks with unstructured data you can search through data you can discover answers to to your specific questions you can classify and label your data automatically with machine learning models and vva can predict relation in your data the vector and database the vector database vv8 has full crowd support for both data and vectors and you can combine vector search and scalar filters which means you can combine this uh semantic search with traditional search it has a graphql and restful api and we've expert supports multiple data types like text but also images and this is all possible through viv88 modules so modules can be attached to vva's [Music] to the v8 core vector database to enable the features i just described in the previous slide for example you can choose to use an image factorization module to index images and search through these images but you can also attach a question answering module you can also attach any transformer nlp model or you can even attach your own machine learning or np models so this allows you to use vvate really for scaling your own machine learning models to production skill as well so now let's move on to a demo um i will use a data set of news articles for this demo and you can also find this demo data set running on our website you can go here from any code example a query example so over here there is a really simple question or query to first just see what kind of articles we have in this data set so i can perform a get query to get all the articles and here i just want to see their titles their urls and their word count and here i get a list in random order of all the articles so now of course nothing nothing special or nothing magic is happening here and just to show you that it is a vector database you can also query the whole vector of a data object so you get the long list of vectors so now let's only show the title and as i said this is just a scalar search so i don't do any machine learning magic here but now let's uh let's take a semantic filter so for example let's see if the data set has any articles regarding housing prices i can perform a near text query and this filter is added by a specific text factorization module so let's see if there are articles about housing prices and you can see this is very abstract question and here the list of articles is ordered to the relevancy [Music] to the to the search query so we have for example uh something about housing becoming the biggest asset class something else about housing prices um expensive housing etc and note that the query housing prices uh is not an exact match of any of the words here in in the title so here you can see that v8 uses semantics and the context rather than accept matching keywords we can also ask for how certain weaviate is to show certain results this is called certainty so here you see that the first result is around 87 yeah certain that it is matching the search query and we can also make a filter based on this so now i will show only results that are above 80 certain all right now you can see that this is a very abstract query and we can also make this a bit more concrete for example to see the prices of houses in greece this is a bit more concrete and you can see that there's only one result returned now because we made the query more concrete and this is about athene so yeah we can see that uh viviate matches greece here with its its capital without saying anything about greece so as i said with vv8 you cannot only store factors but also it stores the whole data objects so this means you can combine these kind of factor searches with a traditional scalar search and yeah for example i will show you this i will add some properties first so we have for example each article appearing in a publication um so we can see that this article for example appeared in the financial times this is a graph relation in the in the database and now i can make a a scalar filter combining with this already existing vector query so this is a rare search so now we can see i'm currying for housing prices again and i want the result to appear in this publication the economist so let's see now um so this first result it's 87 sure um this is the title and we can see it appears in the economies um we can also ask questions to aviate or to the data i invade if we have a question answering module available or enabled i can also show this so i will remove the previous filters so i can ask a question also in a filter for example what what was the monkey doing in the neura link video and i will not query the certainty here but i want to see the answer and the answer here is he was playing mindbong so if we limit the result to one and we also ask for the summary this is the yeah the summary of the article um so the result is that monkey was playing mindbong and the answer was found somewhere in this whole summary which is of course the bit of unstructured text that we have here okay so now let's go back to the presentation um so you can use wev8 for uh yeah a big variety of use cases due to the flexibility of choosing your own machine learning model or also keeping it very general so this was my presentation thank you for for listening and watching in this presentation you learned that with the open source open source search factor engine rev8 you can search through unstructured data and in addition you can use vva to bring your own machine learning models to production skill thank you and see you ", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Vector Database @ ML Conf42", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcGNmdey9hs", "timestamp": "",
