{"text": "Recorded presentation of Weaviate during the Machine Learning conference Conf42. Laura Ham tells you about Weaviate: open ... \nhi everyone welcome to my presentationof the vector search engine weaviatei'm laura home i'm a community solutionengineer at semi technologiesand in this presentation i willintroduce you to our open sourcefactor search engine we evadefirst first let's take a look at dataand particularlyabout unstructured data unstructureddata are forms of data that are notorganized in a predefined mannertake for example big pieces of textwe learned that 93 percent of your datastate stays unusedand is unstructured and that 80 percentof businessesdon't know how to use their unstructureddata in favor of their businesswhy is this so difficult what's sodifficult about unstructured dataone thing that is difficult is searchingthrough unstructured datafor example to answer business questionslet me give you an example a simpleexample of searching throughunstructured dataif you want to find information fromunstructured textyou will need to use exact matching ofkeywords to find an answerif you look for example for a wine thatfits with your seafood dinnerwell wine in your database only tellsyou thatit is good with fish you will mostlikely not find this wineif you instead use a vector and searchengine like vvateyou can find information in unstructureddata based on semanticscompare this with google search if youask googlea very abstract question it might findan answerthe question here what color of wine ischardonnayis very abstract still google searchfinds exactly this answerfrom a particular data node so thequestion ishow does google find exactly this answerfrom exactly this data nodeand how can we predict the relationbetween this answer and the questionthat weasked and in addition how can we do thisso fastso the main question here is uh yeahwhat could you what if you could do thesame with your own datain a simple and secure wayso the answer that we came up with isweaviatewev8 is a database that uses machinelearning to understand the data that isin itso eviate is a cloud native modularreal-time vector search enginethat is built to scale your machinelearning modelsso as i said wavy 8 is a vector searchengineso first let's dive in what vectorsearch actually iswe evade stores data as vectors whichare placed in a space in relation toother data objectsmachine learning models are used tocompute a vector for each data objectand also for each semantic query so wevvat really tries to understand yourdata and your queriesin more detail this is how vv8 workswith a text factorization modulea pre-trained model for example a fasttext or bird transformer modelcan compute vectors from known conceptsthis is forexample our daily human languageyou can add your own data to aviateinstance and all these data will bevectorized using these machine learningmodelsand be placed as vectors and uh withtheir own data objectinto v8the re the data objects will just beindexed by the machine learning modelsand be placedin the high dimensional vector spacethen you can perform for example asearch querywhich will also be factorized usingmachine learning modelsof vv8 for example let's finda wine that fits with seafoodwe v8 computes doesnear a similarity search and find theobjects that lies nearest to yoursearch vector so the answer that liesclosest to the vector of this questionwill be returnedwith viviate you can do the followingtasks with unstructured datayou can search through data you candiscover answers toto your specific questions you canclassifyand label your data automatically withmachine learning modelsand vva can predict relation in yourdatathe vector and database the vectordatabase vv8has full crowd support for both data andvectorsand you can combine vector search andscalar filterswhich means you can combine this uhsemantic search with traditional searchit has a graphql and restful api andwe'veexpert supports multiple data types liketext but also imagesand this is all possible through viv88modulesso modules can be attached to vva's[Music]to the v8 core vector databaseto enable the features i just describedin the previous slidefor example you can choose to use animagefactorization module to index images andsearch through these images but you canalso attach a question answering moduleyou can also attach any transformer nlpmodelor you can even attach your own machinelearning or npmodels so this allows you to use vvatereally for scaling your own machinelearning modelsto production skill as wellso now let's move on to a demo umi will use a data set of news articlesfor this demo and you can also findthis demo data set running on ourwebsiteyou can go here from anycode example a query exampleso over here there is a really simplequestionor query to first just see what kind ofarticles we havein this data set so i can perform a getquery to get all the articles and here ijust want to see their titlestheir urls and their word countand here i get a list in random order ofall the articlesso now of course nothing nothing specialor nothing magicis happening hereand just to show you that it is a vectordatabase you can alsoquery the whole vector of a data objectso you get the long list of vectorsso now let's only show the titleand as i said this is just a scalarsearchso i don't do any machine learning magicherebut now let's uh let's take a semanticfilter so for example let's seeif the data set has any articlesregarding housing pricesi can perform a near text queryand this filter is added by a specifictextfactorization module solet's see if there are articles abouthousing pricesand you can see this is very abstractquestionand here the list of articles is orderedto the relevancy[Music]to the to the search query so we havefor example uh something abouthousing becoming the biggest asset classsomething else about housing prices umexpensive housing etcand note that the queryhousing prices uh is not an exact matchofany of the words here in in the title sohere you can see that v8 uses semanticsandthe context rather than accept matchingkeywordswe can also askfor how certain weaviate is to showcertain resultsthis is called certainty so here you seethat the first resultis around 87yeah certain that it is matching thesearch queryand we can also make a filter based onthis sonow i will show only results that areabove 80 certainall right now you can see that this is avery abstract queryand we can also make this a bit moreconcrete for exampleto see the pricesof houses in greecethis is a bit more concreteand you can see that there's only oneresult returned now becausewe made the query more concrete and thisis aboutathene so yeah we can seethat uh viviate matches greece here withits its capital without saying anythingabout greeceso as i said with vv8 you cannot onlystorefactors but also it stores the wholedata objectsso this means you can combine these kindof factor searcheswith a traditional scalar search andyeah for example i will show youthis i will add some propertiesfirst so we have for example eacharticle appearing in a publicationumso we can see that this article forexample appeared in the financial timesthis is a graph relation in the in thedatabaseand now i can make a ascalar filter combining with thisalreadyexisting vector queryso this is a rare searchso now we can see i'm currying forhousing prices again and i want theresult to appear inthis publication the economistso let's see now umso this first result it's 87 sureum this is the title and we can see itappears in the economiesum we can also ask questions to aviateor to the data i invade if we havea question answering module availableor enabled i can also show this so iwill remove the previous filtersso i can ask a question also in a filterfor example whatwhat was the monkey doing in theneura link videoand i will not query the certainty herebut i want to see the answerand the answer here ishe was playing mindbong so if we limitthe result toone and we also ask for the summarythis is the yeah the summary of thearticleum so the result is that monkey wasplaying mindbongand the answer was found somewhere inthis whole summarywhich is of course the bit ofunstructured text that we have hereokay so now let's go back to thepresentationum so you can use wev8 foruh yeah a big variety of use cases dueto the flexibility of choosingyour own machine learning model or alsokeeping it very generalso this was my presentation thank youforfor listening and watching in thispresentation you learned that with theopen sourceopen source search factor enginerev8 you can search through unstructureddataand in addition you can use vva to bringyour own machine learning modelsto production skill thank you and seeyou", "type": "Video", "name":
