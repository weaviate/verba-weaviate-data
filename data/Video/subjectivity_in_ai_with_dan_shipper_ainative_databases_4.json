{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the fourth and final episode of the AI-Native Database series with Dan Shipper! \n[Music] [Music] n [Music] hey everyone we're super excited to present the AI native database podcast series we've invited some incredible people discuss where these new advances in generative AI are taking us and the role that database systems will play in it this series contains four interviews with Andy Pavo Paul grth John Ma and Dan shipper all four podcasts feature weeva co-founder and CEO Bob vanl thank you so much for watching I really hope you enjoy the series hey everyone thank you so much for watching the WEA podcast I'm super excited to present another episode in our special edition CEO series featuring WEA CEO Bob vanl and today we host Dan shipper the creator of every every is an incredible blog as well as a Discord Community as well as a writing app this kind of futur looking business around all sorts of exciting things in our series discussing what is the future of databases where are these AI native Technologies taking us Bob and Dan thank you both so much for joining the podcast thanks thanks for having me uh I I love the energy I'm excited great to be back aome Zen maybe kick it off just with um this perspective on gbt 4 as a reasoning engine and sort of uh the thinking behind this blog post yeah I I wrote a post uh I guess in in March um of this year called gbd4 is reasoning engine and it was sort of around the time when um gbg4 had come out I think it came out like maybe like a month prior you know pretty pretty close to when it came out and I'd been at this Sequoia event um in San Francisco and I'd watched Sam Alman speak and he made this he made that point he said um uh you know these models are reasoning engines they're not knowledge databases and I feel like that's a really important thing that people like need to understand or at least at that time needed to understand I think that we a little bit further along now but it's still like a it's still a point that I think people don't quite get which is um generally when you ask these models questions like you asked gb4 or any other model like Bard or anything like that um people get hung up on the fact that they get qu they get the answers wrong um fairly frequently they get hung up on the sort of like hallucination problem and um what the article is about is um uh sort of examining how a lot of the hallucination problems go away when you provide these models with um the right information to reason over in order to uh in order to answer the the any kind of question that you have and so rather than like writing off these models um entirely what we should what we should sort of um start to understand is that um you can break up intelligence into two things one is reasoning and the other one is knowledge um and and gbd4 is like really good at reasoning if it has all the right facts at its disposal like it's going to give you probably the right answer in a lot of cases some some forms of reasoning it's like l good at like math um but you know there are ways around that um so it's really good at reasoning what it's not really good at is knowledge because it doesn't have any explicit um knowledge representation in inside of itself it's all stochastic um but what you can do is if you pair gb4 with a knowledge source that can provide it the right facts at the right time um it's it the quality of its responses get get significantly better and um that's I think really interesting because it means that today the quality of responses that we get from our models is not even necessarily Bound by things like the you know the number of parameters um as as much it's actually Bound by um how good are we at finding the right information to give to the model um at inference in order to give it um in order to uh get get the answer that we want and if we can get it if we can um you know get it the right information it'll go much further and so I think uh you know that points to the importance of things like private knowledge repositories that are either personal or company specific um it also it also points to the importance of like vector search for example which is how we find the right facts to to give to give to the model and Vector search is great but like there's a lot of ways in which you have to do lots of weird fancy stuff in order to get the right um you know information out of out of the database and so I think those dimensions are are ones that we'll see like really interesting uh uh new things from over the next couple years and it's why for example I think even though Bard is like kind of far behind I'm pretty bullish on Google as a as a place to um get uh like get good quality responses from because Google has all the information that that can you know sort of make it easy to um to provide the right answers so I've been blabbing for a while but that's the basic gist of the of the article yeah and and I have I have a quick question so so before we we double click on that right so it would be help can you also for the listeners can you def can you define in the context of not per gb4 but just the models in general right can you define uh what you mean with like the knowledge representation and what do you mean with reasoning maybe or maybe give an example about the the differences what we might be expecting from the from the uh from the models yeah it's it's it's a really good point so like um when I say something uh when I talk about the uh the models being sort of stochastic what I what I mean is um when I say something like Mary had a little um in your mind you you know I'm going to say like lamb um because you know that like lamb follows from Mary hat a little um and that's that's a lot of what the the models are doing they've seen um you know uh strings of tokens um billions and billions and billions of times and they have an internal representation of what tokens usually follow from another um and that means that when you ask it a common question like who is George who who is the first president of the United States the models are going to be quite good at um completing George Washington because they just see that those um tokens following from um from that question like over and over and over again or things that look like that question over and over and over again um but they'll tend to fall down in in other areas um so for example if you ask the model who I am I'm definitely less wellknown than George Washington and so sometimes it gets it wrong because it's sort of it's again it's stochastic it sort of it generally knows that I'm a Founder for example but it doesn't know the name of the company that I founded um and that's because there's there's no explicit representation of um who or what is like what is going on in the world inside the model as far as We Know there there might there there's like a lot of deep research as to like whether or not these models have like have um world representations inside of them but I think in like for the purposes of this conversation there's there's we it's it's it's pretty clear that there's probably no it's not doesn't work like a database where the model can go like look it up and and get the exact answer to the question um and the uh uh you know I think I think reasoning is is sort of like a little bit uh slippery to Define but it's basically like uh given a set of facts or given a given a starting point can you like can you arrive at a new answer that follows from the set of facts is as like as one way to one way to define it and then I think knowledge is like is the actual it's sort of like the set of facts um and again it's sort of slippery because you know GB gbt is like quite uh it's not generally good at math and and that's like the that's the the the basic you know idea of what reasoning is it's it's it's not as good at like like really highly highly um uh logical reasoning where uh if you make one mistake it totally throws it off it's a little bit fuzzier than that um but that that's the general that's the general gist yeah that that's super interesting and I think also the I I'm all I'm also thinking about like the um the objective versus the subjective nature um uh of the answers that it's providing so for example with George Washington there's probably somebody else also who's who's called George Washington right but it's like a it's kind of you can assume that if somebody asked that question right that you're referring to the to the president the one thing that I find super interesting and I would love to to hear your thoughts on this as well right so one thing that we're thinking about is something that we call the the AI native stack right or the AI stack and that kind of um is related to what you said about Google so what I find intriguing is that today so actually know like about a year ago made this transition that we were talking about machine learning and then with machine learning we really talked about the models and then all of a sudden after like jgpt we just you know removed the the abbreviation ML and replace it with AI and we started to refer to these to these to these models using AI however what I find so interesting what you're saying in combination with um um with for example with Google and the infrastructure that Google has is that if I ask a very uh um a subjective question to the right and I said like where can I get a great C no so what's a great coffee place right very subjective was a great coffee place yeah then if you have if you for example use do that via Bart then maybe Google knows through their Maps infrastructure oh this guy is now standing in a I don't know in somewhere in the street in Paris so we're going to recommend a great coffee place that's in Paris nearby where he is so my question is I'm I'm very curious how you see that if this reasoning engine that is evolving will that be captured just in one big model somehow or is it actually that stack that's emerging that contains the models but also Defector databases the existing infrastructure and so on and so forth yeah I think that's I think that's sort of what I'm what I'm what I'm getting at is um response quality is not Bound by model quality it's currently it's you you you can um you can keep the model size the same and and and and all that kind of stuff but if you add a vector database and and and a couple of other a couple of other tools to the model that the model can use it will dramatically in increase its ability to give you good results so I do think the stack matters I I don't know like I you know to the to to a point you made earlier I don't know like in 20 years uh it's Poss that we may not need like an explicit database and it's all kind of stochastic in the model and the model is smart enough that it doesn't matter like you know humans don't don't really have um in inside of our brains at least uh it seems like a like a a database it's all kind of like sort of sarcastic but we do use Excel and we do use libraries and stuff so like I think even at the point where we have an AGI like there's there's a use there's a usefulness to actual structured information that you can query um even for like a very very intelligent um machine that's a it's that's that's a good point it that's fascinating sorry Connor I I'm not sure if you want to say something interrupted you oh no well I was just gonna yeah I think the whole kind of comparing it with Google is very interesting versus structured information that you kind of privately curate and I because ially like kind of researching you Dan and reading your blogs and stuff is is kind of like note taking and so I really would love to of you know open up that uh like Google information versus your kind of private information and how you see that well depends on where you um where you keep your information a lot of people keep their information in Google Docs so Google has that too um I think that they're both they're both obviously quite valuable for for different purposes um I think um one way to think about the dividing line is um uh whether it's new to me or not um and there's a lot of there are a lot of times where I want something that's that's that's net new to me and I think in that case like Google is obviously like an Irreplaceable resource for that kind of thing um but I think a lot of us go through our lives um bumping into things that um that we know kind of fit that like ineffable taste that we have that thing we're like I like this whether it's like a a quote or a book or like a movie or a restaurant recommendation or whatever like or even a fact like little thing about how to how you should run your company how you should make decisions all that kind of stuff like it just pings you and you're like oh this this makes sense to me but you're kind of like I can't use this right now um and so a lot of us do this thing where we just like compulsively like throw it into a notebook or throw it into a Notes app or whatever um and then we just generally never use it again and never run into it again um and um but I I do think the the the like fundamental problem that needs to be solved is here's a thing I know it will be useful but it won't it's not going to be useful right now and I don't know what it will be useful for in the future but bring it back to me when it will be useful when you think it might be um and we've never found like an actually like uh really good solution for that but I think AI is is sort of um uniquely capable of of doing that for us and I think um uh there's a lot of value in in resurfacing private knowledge because it's already curated it's already like on your Vibe you know um because you took the time to like write it down um that there's something about it that could be helpful for you and so if I had to pick between like a generic Google result for example and something that I like saved five years ago but I didn't I don't remember that I saved it I would pretty I would probably prefer the latter um especially like you know one of the really interesting things that I think we're going to have to think think about is um when when you use like chat GPT browsing or any of these things like they ended up querying on a search engine and a lot of search engine results are not great um so again like the quality of the response is bound by the quality of the of the search that you can do and then the quality of the results from the search engine um and I I think in in some of those use cases actually I'd rather just search my private stuff so that I don't run into all the like SEO blog post spam and and and all the stuff that ends up like clogging of Google yeah and and and this is what what I also find interesting Rel to this is that the so you just mentioned like uh um a Google Docs right so what I find so interesting is like one of the things if like as I as a as as a human right if I if I um uh want to keep some information I basically my mind I mean I'm not literally doing thinking about this but what I'm basically doing is that I say okay do I have in like some qualitative information that I want to store because if that's what I have um uh then then it's probably something I I'm going to write down like in in how's that called well the word equivalent of Google docs right but the um if I have something more quantitative I might use spreadsheets right because I just have a spreadsheet where I store um the information I I think just with the quality of like how we you know parsing that information feeding that to the model and and Conor how you just released um uh the um the podcast with with metalon about like how she you know the work she's been doing on that kind of stuff I think that's kind of that's indeed kind of a solved problem what I find so interesting is that the the way that we've been using these Technologies until Google searched today from the way of the beginning is that it was so super it was like super um uh quantitive right so it's like it was it was just it was just um uh super objective you have a quy this is the page where you might find the answer and however it's written on a page we don't know we don't care but what the model adds to that is more that qualitative angle right that this this subjectiveness of potentially having an opinion on what you're what you're doing right so if you search on something about like U um uh um yeah I don't know uh I don't know right if you if you write like maybe weird example but like you how to build a bomb right then Google search might show you just a page that goes hey this is just this is just how but the model might say do you really want to do that do you understand that this is actually dangerous thing to do yeah and I'm fascinated by that by that I'm not sure this is smart thing going to podcast but the the point that I'm trying to make an intellectual point with this but the the point I'm trying to make is the I'm fascinated by the subjectiveness so even that I noticed that the system prts in jgpt are changing that they try to make it less opinionated yeah these things give me an opinion on what I want to know and I'm just I just I I need to get used to that I noticed and I'm just curious how how do you think that that will evolve into the future I think it's I think it's great honestly um I there's there's a lot here so like one thing is um when when you're asking for things that you want to know I think uh what Google basically does is it just finds websites that have the same words um but often like you can't really put things into words or the words that you should be using are different from the words that you are using and I think um chat gbt is like incredible at helping you actually put to words something you can't put into words and then um returning you the right thing uh in a way that was like previously completely ungoogleable so like a really good example is um you know I I I was writing a piece like a couple weeks ago and I I had this like it was a practical guide for how to use chat gbd custom instructions but I really wanted to have like a good opening for it like a kind of voicey explainer like where it felt funny and it felt like it wasn't just like a 10 tips to do chat chbt or whatever right um and I think those articles are pretty rare like really practical articles that also have a little bit of a a voice a little bit of a literary quality maybe a little poetic or a little funny all that kind of stuff but that's an and and for me I would usually want to like look at an example so I can get it in my ear like a writer that I love um to like to sort of get it in my ear and then I can write my own version of it but that's sort of an ungoogleable question I cannot I cannot search like voicey poetic literary explainers of technical topics because like um the only way that that will show up in Google is if someone else had the idea to like collect that but that just it's too it's too specific um but I can go to chat gbt and I can say exactly that and then it gives me me a list and then I'm like uh like a list of articles that it that it returns of you know voicey explainers or whatever and then I can be like no no no that's not quite right I want you to make it I want you to lean a little bit more toward people who write like digital writers I don't want any books or um people who are writing specifically about technical topics and you can just sort of like narrow it down and then eventually I just came to this Joel spolski article I love Joel spolski um sort of an OG internet blogger um and uh it was a Joel spolski article from 2003 and it was like the perfect article for me to like write the thing I needed to write and it was like incredible and it was like totally ungoogleable and it was about chbt um being able to uh understand what I was saying Help Me refine it and then return something that is like um that uh that matches the thing that I was trying to say without even me using that the words I was using were not contained at all in the article that I was um that I was looking for and I think that that is that is really cool you can find things based on a Vibe now which is which is is interesting and I think it's related to the personality point that you're making and I think in general one of the like consequences of this personality point which is um each of these models have a bit of a Vibe and each of these models have different set of restrictions or rules or or things that they'll do in the same way that people do I think um what what that will do is over time it will um create a sort of like splitting off effect where people will find models that have personality types that speak to them um and it will be a little bit I I do think that chbt will be sort of like the default and people like the bulk of people will use chbt it'll be like the main source of Truth in a lot of ways um but then there will be this sort of splintering effect where it's sort of like um uh like media companies um you know like the New York Times is like the paper of record or Wikipedia is like they they say everything in the most neutral fact-based possible way because it's the highest scale thing but then there are all these other media companies that are like Vice or like Fox News or whatever that have that like very specific slant or spin or voice that's for a particular kind of person um and I think we'll probably see something similar and indeed we are already seeing that like with character AI um I don't know I don't know how How Deeply you guys have gone into that but that's like a really really popular chatbot service where you can chat with different per chatbots of different personalities that are often famous people or people from books or or movies and stuff like that um and so I think that's that's one interesting consequence is that the more these things are like people the more that they have personalities I think the personalities are like incredibly um incredibly important incredibly core to this but they also create this situation where um a more specific personality is going to be more uh more interesting for for groups of people and are probably unbundle into those groups I it's so interesting what you're saying there because the one thing that I'm personally always excited about with is when these new things happen right in the in in the industry it is like it often starts with these displacement services so in this case it was like through now the whole the hype is like with with Rag and and that kind of stuff it's like okay we're gonna we're g to do qu go better search right because we have another model and we inject that information into the uh into the model but um what I'm actually always more excited about it's like okay what is the new what are the new businesses that are being built right what are the new startups what are the new products that we're seeing and it's so so funny that you mentioned character in AI because because that model now all of a sudden brings that subjectiveness to the table right so from being purely objective like Google Google search I mean as you mentioned then where you said like you know if somebody wrote an article about this poetic whatever I'm looking for then it will find it but if it didn't then there's just no it just says like I can't find it right and that people start to now create businesses around that subjective nature of what the models bring so character has a good example from that right so this you basic the information stream is going to stay the same but the way how it's going to be presented to you or what it picks to present to you is evolving over time based on who you are and what you want and I find that that I think that that is the new thing that that in information retrieval um that it brings to the table that it yeah and and for I'm not sure if I'm when I'm saying like objective versus subjective that if that's the right way of saying it but that's how it feels to me because it's like a the model um uh generates a uh a string of tokens based on an order that you prefer and I find that I find it fascinating yeah it's it is interesting because like um the the order that you prefer like there is something like that in databases right now which which would probably be in the in the kind of um more objective realm under under this like dichotomy but it's things like um sort it in a different way or like limit it to this number of Records or whatever um but I think um there's there's a much higher dimensional ability to like get the thing get the tokens in the order that you prefer with um with GPT like it allows you to um conduct way more Transformations on the output than you you could in the previous sort of regime where you could only like slice tokens up or limit the number or um sort them in in a very specific kind of way and I think that's really really interesting yeah and I I I have to think about the analogy of of to add one more one more thing Connor if I might add one more thing so the the the thing that I that I um that I recently thought about was like I I read somewhere and I forgot where it was about um so if you have like cookbooks right so with recipes and then I I don't mean software cookbook but like actual you know uh that the books that chefs use yeah um that often these books um they especially the older ones they don't Define actually what kind of cery you need to use so for example if says like a tablespoon of a that depends on the cook what they Define what counts as a tablespoon especially in different cultures yeah so what I had to think about is like the the knowledge that's in the book is going to be the same in a book in if you read in France or in the US or in Japan it's gonna you know baking a cake is always the same recipe yeah but the tools you're using and how the cake comes out is completely different right and that's kind of feel uh it kind of feels that what Google was doing was just showing us the recipes just the recipes like you know couple eggs you know flour that kind of stuff but now what we're adding is also hey if you like you know if you're if you like I don't know a lot of you know if you're like a big cake that it has like different Cutlery bigger spoons and that kind of stuff and how he presenting that to you so I really see that that that metaphor and I also think that's why people like that kind of stuff because the I I'm of the opinion so recently somebody I was I was in a panel at a conference and somebody asked me why do you think that AI is taking all off all of a sudden right so why wasn't that doing I mean machine learning was there but now all of a sudden it took off and and my answer was that I think that people start to anro prorize the models and we didn't do that before yeah and now we do and I think that's the reason why it's a take of because it's it's more personal it's like the thing talks to you rather than just presenting you with a with a with a search result so that's yeah it's a it's a it's a great Point like humans love technology that like looks or sounds like a human it's like like whoa you know um and and I think there's that there's an there's that effect there where like you use it for the first they like whoa and then the next day you're like I don't know this isn't that useful for like a lot of AI demos but like it just there it just creates this like Sheen of like oh my God to it and then some of them really deliver like I think Chach BT really really um really delivers and um you know one interesting thing to the to the point that you're making earlier is you know sort of about those recipes is I think that that's an underappreciated thing that chat PT does is um it does these subtle translations of text um where like the most basic example is it literally translates English to English um where for example I have someone that works for me he's incredibly talented um and English is his second language um and he has to write a lot of emails for me and you know when you're talking to him in person he like of like he just sounds like basically like a fluent native speaker speaker but when he writes it's like a little bit you can tell it's a little bit not his first language and the minute chat gbd came out his emails got like way better um and because it just like just tweaks it slightly you know um but it's it's not even it's not even just um like you know correcting English it's like actually within English there are all these different languages that we tend to speak between different kinds of people so like a really good example is my dad um he uh he has a cemetery and funeral home business um so it's just a completely different world right but he has an idea for an app he wants to build um related to his business and he can explain that idea to me um but he's he wants to go hire someone to build it and writing the spec to get someone to to give him an estimate and figure out who to hire that's actually like kind of hard it's like hard to get from the Layman's explanation that he can give me to an actual spec for like a job that um someone might you know might might want to work for him for and is that a is I'm sorry yeah I just wanted to quickly ask is that an app where people can organize funerals for all the AI startups that open AI killed with releasing the new jgb version no but I think that's a great idea there's probably a big market for that um um and um and you know historically like I would have had to write it for him because I I know enough to like translate what he's saying to to to a spec but I just said go talk to chat GPT about it and chat GPT can write it right because it knows what he's trying to say and it knows the language to put it in um and it can do the subtle translation to make it look like someone who really knows what they're doing has put this together with what um with taking taking what he says and turning it into something that someone can use and I think that that's like a really deeply underappreciated leverage point of these tools um because you know I I don't think that we realize how much we actually within the the one language that we speak we we speak many many different languages there many many many different subcultures of people that talk in certain ways and AI can kind of translate between those subcultures and I think that's really powerful I if I may sorry Conor I just want I'm so excited I have one more question and then I'll I so the for then so so um I'm very curious if you if we if I um talk to you then which your writer head on right so if the um I'm think think of this analogy right that there was like this time when electric guitars came around and the thing was I I'm I'm a big music fan right so you had like last PA on the guitar and the the one thing was like you shouldn't put like the the speaker too loud you shouldn't turn up the volume or the gain too much because otherwise it went in overdrive and it was seen as something bad yeah and then we got like Jimmy Hendrick and Jimmy Hendricks just turn it all on and then we had Jimmy Hendrick right so as a writer so what is the equivalent for writers in the creative process to Turning CH GPT in overdrive what how what what do you think we're going to see what what is what is gonna be new in the creative process question I actually I don't I don't know the answer yet um like I can I can tell you how I use it um so uh you know for example like I just I told you about earlier it found me a great example of a piece that was like the piece I wanted to write or like it often like if I'm trying to express something like want to use a metaphor or simile like it will help me find that metaphor or simile but I think um uh usually you know in the example that you gave um uh what Jimmy Hendrick did was he took the thing that um was a unique feature of the new technology that um that seemed to be a mistake or seemed to be something that was like over like overused and he just owned it um and so like the filter that I think we should put on is like what is the thing that um that is sort of uniquely AI generated um that is seen to be like sort of low status or a mistake that someone could like own and like really turn into something interesting um the first thing that comes to mind for me is like right now um a any writer that says that they use chat GPT in their process like people get upset about that and I think that's a big opportunity is to like own the fact that like some of this is written by AI it's me and the AI you know it's not the whole thing but like you know uh if you want to read me like you're GNA get some AI stuff I think that's like up for the taking because like no very few few professional writers would be willing to do that and and I think a lot of readers would be upset about it um so there's there's automatically a filter there I think the other thing is just like um there is a distinctively AI generated voice these days um that sounds like chachu BT and I don't know what that will evolve into but I could see that being fertile ground for like artists to play with and to be like what do we make out of this like this distinctive AI voice because it it's like an it's it defines an era in the same way that like mid journey and Dolly images are going to Define this error for art um that voice will define an error for writing and um right now it's looked at as low quality and and it is to to be clear um but I think people will learn how to use that in an Artful highquality way and that will become new art that like the next generation will look at as being high status fting well so I I think this whole thing has been incredibly profound and and kind of I really like this talking about the subjective voice of you know G of gpc4 and so on and these kind of translations and so I guess my question to you both is maybe kind of going into this like I'm very curious in particularly how this will how this technology will look like is whether to get the AI voice you have to like kind of I think character AI they fine-tune the language model so you you know you get a bunch of data on things Dan shipper said Bob vanl said and I fine-tune the language models to have this voice or if I can just have gbt 4 as the reasoning engine and if I can just retrieve things that Dan and Bob have said to each to then get the voice of Dan and Bob yeah um so a couple things I don't think that character AI is is doing fine-tuning I think the way character AI works is you just give it instructions and you say like here's how I'd like the voice to sound and then it will like um try to emulate that voice and gbg4 does that too so gp4 has a system prompt where you can say like hey I'd like you to emulate Dan shipper you know or whatever um and as long as gp4 knows about that person or has examples of the kind of text that you're you're looking for it will try to do it it's not like G to be that spoton um but it'll be it'll be close and I think over time it will get even closer I think when you're talking about like sort of the retrieval augmented Generation stuff where it's like um uh you know I ask a question and then it goes and finds uh examples of stuff I've written and or someone ask a question it goes and finds examples of the stuff I've written and and then tries to answer based on that that um that text I think generally when you're doing that that's going to be for uh kind of answering fact-based questions so it'll know stuff about me it's less so for mimicking my voice although I guess you could like to the extent that I've ever written anything or said anything that like sounds like the answer to that question you could tell GPT to like uh use what it finds to reformulate and answer in my voice but like generally people don't don't use retrieval augmented generation for that um but yeah I think like the the thing that will Pro yeah probably be most uh useful over time is yeah specific fine tuning for a particular writer or a particular voice to like mimic the mimic The Voice yeah yeah but isn't this actually um an opportunity right so it's like I it's it's I never thought about it this way but currently um uh when we talk about rag we talk about that knowledge base so we want to extend the knowledge base of the uh uh that the the mod has access to but what if we would use rag not to uh head back to the um uh objective subject nature of things that we don't want to give it like objective knowledge but that we actually want to give it something subjective that we say like yeah we going to True rag we're going to inform you how we want you to do you know whatever we want you to do right so so XYZ so um because again now mostly all these use cases that also that we see with with like with um because of course you know to see a lot of use cases rag is always means extending the knowledge base it almost never means um for example let's say that you have a um this is a very you know um you know this it makes it very um easy to visualize basically so if you talk about poetry right if you want to model to generate something knowledge that it already has right so tell me something about the Eiffel Tower it already has that knowledge but now we're going to give it a poet so we just um tomorrow they they they open some kind of cave they find this unique poetry that was like never digitized so impossible that J had access to it in its training process we digitize it it's okay tell me something about the Eiffel Tower is in the model but we're going to feed you poetry and you need to in this Unique Style that's in this poetry that now you need to tell me about the eiar miming mimicking that style that is using R not for it knowledge but for its subjective way of representing stuff yeah totally I think that um I think that's totally totally an interesting thing to do I think um and and people to be clear they do that with um One Shot or few shot prompting um so with so without using rag at all you just like have that poem in there as an example and then no matter what people put in you just use that poem in your prompt and say like copy this poem and I think the reason for that is um generally you're you don't have to change the ex when you're doing F shop prompting you don't have to change the example that much because it's not um you know with facts like if you're getting knowledge like the knowledge that you're putting in might change all the time but the style of the poem stays consistent um so unless what you wanted is like given any poet uh you know copy the style of the poet and then it would be helpful to like have a database of different poems and Poets and then if I say E Cummings it will go find an e comings and then throw it in the in the prompt I think that would work and that would be sort of retrieval aug M mented Generation Um style so yeah I I think it's helpful I think um generally people don't do it though because the style that they want they just put it in the prompt and um it does it yeah what do you think about that Connor you you have you what are your thoughts on that I'm just curious um well I think the kind of discovery of new style is really interesting like this idea of um I have one style of writing in Dan and one in Bob and then it's like could you hear example can you come up with a new style that's kind of just like where my my train of thought was as I was listening to it but generally with this podcast the whole thing is really inspiring me thinking about this kind of like the unique voice of you know the the AI and I think that's just really profound I think we've covered all sorts of ways of which you can Define that whether it's like I kind of always have like this Persona thing like impersonate Bob and personate edian like people within the company and like give me what their opinion would be like I really like playing with the weeva podcast is the data set where I have like where speaker equals Bob and like weeva graphql and then and then it'll will like retrieve only from Bob to impersonate in that kind of thinking so so that's kind of My overall take on all these ideas is just this kind of unique voice of AI I love this kind of yeah subjectivity this role playing I love the multi-agent kind of concept of like Collective conscious kind of that's really cool yeah and now you're bringing up something else interesting is that even like if you so let's say it would be so interesting that basically if you would have these dream models right that that we're not only looking at again as the knowledge representation but also the the the how they represent the knowledge so the the subjective nature and B you have Connor you have Dan you have Bob and then there's three agents and then see how that conversation evolves that even that might be would be fun right that if we could before we started this conversation that there would be like a one pager like okay we had the three agents mimicking you guys having this conversation already this is what the conclusion was so just take it from there it might be it might be interesting right I love it let's do it for next time yeah that's a deal deal amazing well Dan thank you so much for joining our special weeva CEO series I thought this was such an awesome one this was a really really incredible topic that we dove into to thank you so much of course thanks for having me it was great thanks Dan thanks Conor ", "type": "Video", "name": "subjectivity_in_ai_with_dan_shipper_ainative_databases_4", "path": "", "link":
