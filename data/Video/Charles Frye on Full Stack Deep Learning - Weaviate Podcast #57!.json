{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the 57th Weaviate podcast with Charles Frye! Charles is an educator at Full Stack ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching the wevia podcast I'm super \nsuper excited to welcome Charles Frye \nCharles Frye is an educator at full \nstack deep learning and Charles is \nsomeone who I've been following along \nwith just for me it feels like my entire \ndeep learning career I've always been \nseeing what Charles been posting on \nTwitter and I always feel like I've been \nlearning things from Charles so I think \nalso just the timing of this podcast is \nperfect because you know full stack deep \nlearning and we have all these new tools \nVector databases large language model \napis what has happened with zero shot \nlearning and I think this is going to be \nsuch a great podcast of covering what \nwhat is full stack deep learning now \nlike ml Ops and then full stack like how \nwe usually use the phrase full stack and \nsoftware engineering and how has all \nthis evolved so Charles firstly thank \nyou so much for joining the podcast yeah \nthanks so much for having me Connor and \nthanks for that really uh really kind \nintroduction \nmaybe uh before we kind of dive into it \ncould you give listeners more of a \nbackground on just like how you came \ninto deep learning and sort of your \npersonal Journey yeah yeah I came into \num came into machine learning and and \ndeep learning through a path that's \nincreasingly deprecated these days \num I did neuroscience and biology first \num in undergrad I did some research on \nuh giving people MDMA and asking them \nhow they felt and shooting lasers into \nMouse brains to see what the patterns in \ntheir biological neural networks look \nlike \num so uh but then when it was time to \nlook at doing a PhD I looked around and \nit seemed like the ml world was really \npicking up this was 2014 or so so uh \nsort of the early applications of \nconvolutional networks to really hard \ncomputer vision problems \num and that looked like it was going to \nbe like successful in the coming decade \nand so I did a pivot and did a PhD in \nthe Neuroscience department at UC \nBerkeley but studying artificial neural \nnetworks studying initially some like \napplications to neuroscience and then \neventually kind of the mathematics the \noptimization of neural networks and then \nfrom there from the PHD at Berkeley have \ngone on to kind of end up in this role \nas an educator in the ML and deep \nlearning space sort of sharing ideas \nresearch and how and sort of combining \nthem with ideas from engineering and the \ndevelopment of applications initially at \nweights and biases it's kind of like a \neducator developer relations kind of \nperson uh and then now at full stack uh \nteaching \num you know teaching people \num most recently about how to build \nstuff with large language models \nyeah amazing and I think um Also to \nclarify for listeners full stack deep \nlearning is kind of the key conversation \ntopic and also the actual name of this \ncourse which is awesome and and yeah I \nthat is coming from a PhD in \nneuroscience at you know a school like \nBerkeley and then coming in that's just \nso impressive and I think it's also \ninteresting I I mean maybe I'd like to \nstay I think this would be a great \ntransitioning topic because the your \nbackground in weights and biases and \nexploring convolutional networks the way \nI understand weights and biases and I'm \nsure you're gonna you know help me with \nthis is like this kind of hyper \nparameter tuning because I remember in \nthe early days of training convolutional \nnetworks like the learning rate bash \nsize how many layers the number of \nhidden units all of this was so \nsensitive and it was about finding this \nhorrific combination of these things \nmaybe I'll quickly explain a little more \nabout your perspective on ML Ops at uh \nweights and biases yeah um so definitely \nthat was my view of it when I kind of \nlike first came across it \num that was something that really stuck \nout to me this sort of like hyper \nparameter sweeping stuff \num but as I like worked there and saw \nthe product develop and saw the use \ncases for ML develop like the thing that \nreally really mattered is monitoring and \nobservability for \num \nfor experiments for the like \nexperimentation phase of building an ml \npower product I think they've like \nexpanded since uh I left like two years \nago \num and they recently announced a \nproduction monitoring beta so it's not \njust for that \num but the thing that I saw was this \nlike \num with you know a small amount of \ninstrumentation a few lines of code \nbeing able to get like system metrics \nmodel metrics all that in one place \nalongside with like what code was I \nrunning I remember I ran into a \ndistributed systems like Heisenberg like \na bug with um a bug that sometimes \nhappens and sometimes doesn't uh because \ndistributed training is just not \ndeterministic \num or is not deterministic unless you've \nspent all of your time engineering it to \nbe so \num and uh and ran into what turned out \nto be a a Heisenberg a random bug but I \nwouldn't have believed it unless I could \ncompare two ways and biases runs right \nnext to each other this was the state of \nthe disc this was the state of the disc \nthey're identical one has the bug one \ndoes not have the bug \num so that kind of like that's the sort \nof like software engineering like bug \nsmashing kind of side that bleeds into \nall the way up to the hyper parameter \ntuning being able to see what happened \nwhat your uh what your configurations \nthose hyper parameters where what the \ndownstream uh results were \nhmm yeah absolutely fascinating and \nwe're certainly diving back into \nmonitoring and observability the topic \nand distributed training the topic but \nlet's maybe uh let's set the stage for \nour listeners of um you know full stack \ndeep learning maybe currently I'm just \nyou know we're thinking about this kind \nof like data loaders Vector database \nretrieval augment to generation to large \nlanguage models how do you see kind of \nthe most common you know end-to-end \nstack for building \ndeep learning applications yeah yeah \nthat's a great question so yeah so we \noriginally had the you know full stack \ndeep learning course and actually yeah \nJosh Tobin and Sergey Kari have my \nfellow instructors \num put that together when they were uh \ngrad students at Berkeley \num and that course treats full stack as \nmeaning I can train the models and I can \nlike put them into production and then \nmaybe close the loop and take insights \nfrom production and turn them into uh \nstuff that is used to train the model \nfurther so it's sort of like \nin \nlike Andre carpathy's vision of the like \ndata engine and Tesla where it's like \nyou get inside you like collect data by \nthe models being out there in the world \nthat gets added to your training process \nin some way either as part of evaluation \nor directly as something you calculate \ngradients with \num that the full stack deep learning \nengineer envisioned in that class is the \nperson who can cross that divide or sort \nof go through that entire Loop \num so being able to do enough you know \nenough Pi torch and GPU training and \ndistributed training stuff \num to work at a reasonable scale maybe \nyou know not able to implement uh \nMegatron LM from scratch uh but uh at \nleast uh capable of consuming that \num all the way up to putting something \nin a product and understanding \num what makes it a good product versus a \nnot good product \num and uh that everything that comes in \nbetween that with large language models \nthe full stack developer actually starts \nto look maybe a little bit more like a \nfull stack web developer where a full \nstack web developer is somebody who can \ndesign a user experience but can also \nlike talk to databases and can talk to \nexternal services and so it can build \nlike something that looks like a more \nlike a web application station and at \nleast for now when so much the \ncapabilities are in models that are \ntrained by somebody else available as a \nservice don't require fine tuning and \nonly require like adjustments to \nprompting or adjustments of program and \ncontrol flow around them the the role of \nthat that the beginning part that part \nthat looks more like training models \nthat looks more like um you know \nthinking about uh thinking a ton about \nPi torch pytorch lightning hugging face \nuh that part \nuh becomes a little bit less relevant \nI'd love for it to all come back \ntogether again \num in the coming like year or two as we \nget better open source models as \nfine-tuning returns \num as maybe even training from scratch \nin certain domains returns \num I think we'll see that uh that come \ntogether again and then the full stack \nis now \num uh once again all the way from the \nthe gpus to the databases to the user \nresearch uh and back \namazing it that's kind of exactly what \nI'm hoping to kind of figure out my in \nmy understanding is how this can come \nback to that and how the the new things \ncan still relate to the old ways of \nthinking about ml Ops and so beginning \nwith the I remember a quote from one of \nour earlier podcasts with Chris Dawson \nhe this was back when it was just gbt3 \nand he described it as it's the perfect \nMVP tool like minimum viable product you \nyou just plug it in and you can see like \nwhat this could look like because you \nmentioned like the data engine that \nAndre carpathy describes to a lot of \npeople that's like that's a lot of \noverhead to just get running with that \nright like so maybe we can just it would \nstay on this a little more like usually \nto start building something with deep \nlearning you had you were had a data \ncollection task like a wildly difficult \ndata collection and labeling task yeah \nyeah I totally agree with that I think \nthese Foundation models are clearly \nextremely good at building demos uh \nbecause now my Twitter timeline is 90 \ndemo um but and then there's like a gap \nto get to to the final product and I \nthink one of my favorite examples of \nthis came from Nat Friedman talking \nabout the development of copilot he said \nthey like stood up like four different \nlike distinct language models for coding \nyou know with ins inside vs code GitHub \nso four distinct products that like in a \nweekend \num like they just tried they tried \nautocomplete intellisense they tried \nlike a chat bot type thing and they \ntried like a PR bot type thing and \num they got all of them to like MVP \nextremely quickly and then there was \nlike an extended period of turning them \ninto uh like a sticky actual product and \nthe only one that actually made it that \nfar was co-pilot initially they're \nthey're going further with with copilot \nX now \num and I think that's that's like \nillustrative I think it's kind of common \nin the development of applications that \nthat mvp is easy and the rest is hard \nwith Foundation models I think part of \nwhat makes that eventual development \ninto user product hard is that \neventually you're gonna get have to get \nto the point where you have unique data \nthat is driving unique Model Behavior \nand \nfor a long time maybe there there were \nfewer even demos because it was harder \nwith the original gp3 API to like \ninclude context \num and the patterns hadn't really \ndeveloped and now that we have this \nclear pattern for injecting into prompts \nvia retrieval \num or uh injecting into the model's \nGenerations via tool use we now have \nways to with again without training \nmodels and without really needing to \nhave to set up a full model creation \npipeline uh let alone like an actual \ndata engine you can get a much better \nproduct and that starts to fill in kind \nof the middle area between just \nprompting to like training a model \nentirely from scratch \num you know based off of uh proprietary \ndata or or data specialized to your \nproblem \num so yeah I see it definitely see the \nemphasis on the kind of beginning part \nbut it's also still very much early days \nin the development of applications we \ncould find that there's just the right \npatterns that lead to prompted \nFoundation models building the the whole \napplication themselves \nyeah I think from the first example you \ngave with trying out four different code \ncompletion models I think that's the \nstage a ton of people are in right now \nwhere you you're trying MPT 30 billion \nalpaca you know vicuna you're kind of \nrotating out these cheaper inference \nmodels which one of these will work for \nmy uh \nit was four it was it was different \nproducts right the same models were \nbeing used underneath like say model \nfamily \num and of course they had a problem of \ndeciding like which model to choose and \nthey ended up going with a small fast \nmodel for autocomplete because an auto \ncomplete pick a the way copilot works it \ndoesn't matter if you're wrong because \nusers will just ignore your suggestions \nand people are used to ignoring \nautocomplete they're used to ignoring \nintellisense \num whereas if you do it if you're a chat \nbot like people don't like being told \nwrong things \num if you're doing a PR bot people don't \nlike reviewing PRS that turn out to be \nlike fatally flawed uh and so the like \nquality needs to be really high \num and so that was that was their model \nevaluation problem that they had there \num but that's like nested inside these \nlike like what even product are we \nbuilding are we building this um uh are \nwe building a are we building PR bot are \nwe building uh um a autocomplete uh and \nthat you know key takeaway is the MVPs \nfor all those were easy the products \nsome of them are still under development \nyears later \nyeah it reminds me of like uh like the \nearly days of like when Jasper started \ngetting popularity and I think Facebook \nthey started having papers where it \nwasn't about just the the writing \nassistant wasn't just about writing more \ntexts about like editing your text and \nwhat you mentioned like how exactly do \nwe want these language models to \ninterface and and I think that's the \nquestion now with Lang chain and yeah \nand that's was being so something you \nsaid earlier I love this quote you when \nyou said uh unique data to achieve \nunique Model Behavior and then we \ndiscussed uh better retrievers and you \nknow we're getting into of course how we \nVA interest is this like retrieval to \nthe large language model and so this is \nthe kind of the question that's on my \nmind more than anything else is to \nachieve unique Model Behavior with our \ndata we've plugged it in we've we've \nfigured out the user interface we've \nstarted collecting data should we \nfine-tune the retrieval models or the \nlanguage models or both \nyeah that's a great question \num fine-tuning the language model \nis a little bit more challenging and I \nwould and there's a little bit less to \ngo on in terms of what it means to make \nit better like you might need user \npreferences you might have some like \ncases where you have specific behavior \nthat you want \num but you know even despite the \nadvances in efficient fine tuning I \nstill think that's going to be \nchallenging and then you have a model \nserving problem uh it's a lot easier \nwhen there's only one version of a model \num much simpler version system \num but for so for retrieval I think of \nthat as like a very broad problem right \nthis is like a search or retrieval \nproblem where there's data that lives in \nsome big slow thing like a disk or a \ndatabase and we need to load it into \nsome like very memory sensitive place \num and that memory sensitive place is \nthe like context window of the large \nlanguage model \nand so retrieval via embeddings is one \nvery good way to do that it's a good way \nto do that because retrieving \ninformation from a vector is how a \nTransformer computes and so it's likely \nto be the case that the things you \ncalculate with uh with Vector \nsimilarities with DOT products uh are \nare likely to be uh similar to what the \nlanguage model will do internally uh but \nthat is just one of many ways to get \ninformation out of a large store and \ninto uh the small hot cache uh where it \nis needed and so yeah so I see that as \nlike probably the first like the zero if \nplace to start is like your data your \npre-processing as always nobody wants to \ntalk about it but that's the place where \nyou should spend your time how do I \nparse these documents am I pulling \ngarbage out of my data store uh so just \nlike classic elt and data validation \nproblems uh so definitely that's like \nthat's step zero and then it's like look \nat the retrieval process of that \nincrease that's increase its quality \nprobably maybe it involves passing some \ngradients through a retrieval model but \nhonestly I think you can do a lot with \nlike metadata filtering and and other \nclassic information retrieval techniques \nand then those things uh that improves \nthe inputs to this Downstream uh \nDownstream model \nyeah definitely a lot to unpack I think \num maybe if we can just stay on the the \nlast topic of you know the metadata and \nhow much you can bootstrap we when we \noriginally released hybrid search where \nwe're combining say the zero shot open \nAI models with bm25 and that maybe you \ncould also say re-rank that with a zero \nshot cross encoder which could also kind \nof push it a little further and it's \nit's like yeah maybe you can just kind \nof get pretty far with these zero shot \nmodels when you orchestrate it like that \nespecially because now the large \nlanguage models you can kind of prompt \nthem with the filters that they can add \nto make it filtered Vector search or you \ncould just entirely separate your data \nout into different indexes and ask it \nlike which one to search and llama index \nthey call that the composable indexes \nand \nyeah yeah so there is kind of maybe two \ndistinct patterns one is retrieval \naugmented generation in the like more \nclassic sense feels silly to call \nsomething classic that's only like a few \nyears old but we'll call it clever \num but yeah there's like a classic \nversion of it which is loading \ninformation into the Transformer at like \nboot time you might think of it like \nyou're starting to run your Transformer \non its uh on the on the context it's \nrunning \num and you're just saying what do I need \nto load into that things like Ram once \nthe program starts running \num so that actually it's really more ROM \nwhat do I need to load into the ROM of \nthis thing for it to run like this is \nlike Commodore 64 style like I'm just \nlike I'm punching the tape and saying \nlike you know this is \num you know this is the documentation of \nmy of the library that I want you to \nanswer a question about and that is \num the distinction there is that part \nwe think of that as like separate from \nthe behavior of the language model and \nthat it so it's amenable to like \nsoftware 1.0 or traditional ML and IR \ntechniques and then the other direction \nto go is to say no language models are \nlike reasoning engines language models \nare executors of of like complex program \nflows and retrieving from information \nstore is just the program flow so like \nyou know make it this this me this is \nlike retrieval via tool use \num and I can see there being \napplications where one or the other is \nmore valuable I think the more \nconstrained your application is like the \nless open domain its questions are and \nthe more straightforward the questions \nare to answer once you have the context \nthe more it looks like peer retrieval \naugmented generation \num and so like for the main little \nchatbot uh uh retrieval augmented \ngeneration application that I run which \nanswers questions about our course \nmaterial and about language modeling \npapers uh the goal is for it to just be \na Searcher of that stuff \num and we and so the the open-endedness \nis a little bit less and so there's less \nneed to be like oh like tell me which of \nthese like 50 possible tools and maybe \nrun a Google search to get information \nEtc but for very open-ended maybe things \nthat are starting to tickle the edge of \nbeing like an agentic system then you \nmight want something where retrieval is \njust one of the many tools that the \nlanguage model has access to \nyeah I think that's just completely \nbrilliant is thinking about retrieval as \na tool use compared to well so I think \nto break this apart a bit I think you \nmentioned several times a Transformers \nattend over vectors and you know I hope \nI think our listeners probably most of \nthem are aware of neural architectures \nand how they work generally so you know \nwe have say 12 layers of Transformer and \nso one idea is instead of just \nretrieving to put it in the input you \nretrieve vectors to put it in say layer \n10 out of 12 or 8 out of 12 and and it \ndifferentiates on the memory you could \nyou could have ideas where you \ndifferentiate through the retriever or \neven just you keep that as semi \nsemi-parametric and you just you know go \nthrough the one one to twelve with the \nwith it injected into eight so so that \nkind of architecture \nto me that diverges from just retrieval \nas tool use just because I don't see how \nany other tool could be put in the \nmiddle of an arc and and then I think \nit's extreme like yeah \nyeah yeah I would say that the that sort \nof retrieval augmentation that is baked \ninto the architecture which goes back to \nat least retro \num for this crop of of language models \nand um I'm sure there's some uh Burt \npaper that that did it way earlier and \nand there's a Schmidt Uber paper from 93 \nor whatever \num but yeah but that style of doing it \nwhere you are tightly coupling the \ninternals of the model and the retrieval \nsystem \nI would believe that for narrow tasks \nyou can you like you can differentiate \nthat and then like get really high \nperformance for really low model sizes \nand really quick latencies \num but the that like tight coupling \nthere makes it harder to be like oh well \nnow I want to do a Laura fine tune it's \nlike well how does the Laura fine tune \ninteract with a retrieval thing \num and it's like oh I want to use \nshortcut Transformers I read this thing \nabout shortcut Transformers where you \ncan stop four layers in and then like \npredict the next token immediately and \nit's like oh well how does that interact \nwith it so like the more you start to \nadjust the internals versus treat this \nthing as an interface where you uh where \neither you're interfacing with its \ninputs or its outputs like are used as \ninputs to your interface the the more \nyou like break that abstraction and \nstart injecting into the internals of \nthe model the more Fragile the system \nbecomes the like harder it is to adjust \nand right now at the very least there's \njust so much open field in terms of uh \nwhere where you just think in terms of \nthose external interfaces so for like I \nlike until I see like many papers \ndemonstrating or or many applications \ndemonstrating that that's like gives you \n10x 100x quality at decreased latency or \nsomething I would strongly recommend \nlike not not not opening that Pandora's \nBox \num uh and sticking to the interface \nyeah it would have to be produced by \nsomething like an open AI I mean I think \njust the last two days we've seen two \nmassive fundraising announcement I think \nlike um I think recalabs inflection AI \nraised like 1.3 million which is funny \nenough the exact same number \nso that's kind of funny and so yeah it \nwould have to be one of someone \nproducing a foundation model that comes \nwith the retriever end of it and yeah \nLaura early evening definitely topics \nthat we're going to come back to but \nfirst I want to stay on this tool use \nkind of concept a little further so I \nwas in uh Berkeley as well last weekend \njust didn't go there just I went there \nto see it and I and I met the authors of \ngorilla and I thought gorilla gorilla is \na large language model that's been \nfine-tuned to use particular tools so \nit's like um it's still black boxy you \nknow like it's not we're not talking \nabout putting the latent space of this \ntool into the middle of the Transformer \nbut we're talking about giving it some \nexamples of how to say how how to Surge \nor more like how to use like GitHub CLI \nto like that's one of the examples that \nI was just like wow that's pretty cool \nlike this whole like um where the tool \nis to execute code or to file a pull \nrequest or to review another pull \nrequest like pulling all those levers I \nI find that to be so fascinating so that \nkind of idea like I remember web GPT had \nlike search actions kind of like you \nknow discrete black boxy kind of how to \nuse it what do you think about that idea \nlike fine-tuned to use tools kind of \nyeah I mean I think that we have already \nseen it like you know if you ask me that \nquestion a month ago I would have said \noh geez what we really need is a highly \ncapable Foundation model that has been \nfine-tuned on some kind of tool use \npattern and to be honest what tool use \npattern would I like I'd like something \nthat looks a little bit like an open API \nspec \num so this is something I spent some \ntime working with um the folks at \nSpeakeasy who do API tooling development \nand and um uh just sort of like helping \nthem understand the llm landscape and \nwhat that could mean for them so I got \nsuper into this a couple of months ago \nand learned a bunch about the sort of \nAPI tooling world but it's a way to \nclearly describe what is available via \nan API \num if you've ever used Fast API and \nyou've seen that little like free docs \npage that you get \num if you use gradio for a long time \nthey also showed you that docs page \num that the you know it's the like \nbrightly colored thing with like \ndifferent types of requests and paths \navailable \num it's like it's such a well-specified \nthing that you can build automated \ntooling off of it uh and so like I would \nhave said uh a month ago like yeah \nsomething that's like close open API \nspec as like how you describe your tools \nuh and then like the model knows how to \nproduce a request that goes into that \nAPI and so you fully separate out the \nexecution of the tool from the model and \nyou train the model how to work with the \nwith that specification which means you \naren't training it how to use a specific \ntool right like tool former and Tom both \nkind of are like oh yeah let's like you \nknow let's fine-tune some model to like \nknow when to use a calculator and know \nwhen to search Wikipedia right and react \nuh as a pattern is also like let's use \nfew shot prompting examples to describe \nthe format for a tool uh and then the \nmodel will try and pick it up and both \nof those approaches work okay but \nthey're not extremely they're not super \nflexible and like what you want is the \nis like like a flexibility of tool use \nwith model fine tune right so react has \na lot of flexibility \num at the cost of of token budgets \num and then a little bit of uh reduce \nreliability like a tool formery pattern \nis going to be like extremely reliable \nbut you have to have examples you have \nto fine tune on a specific tool uh so \nfine-tuning on a tool specific on like \nbroad examples from a tool specification \nthat happens to also be a spec broadly \nused by people to describe services that \nthey are making available seems like the \nright move and with Json schema powered \nfunction calls open AI has done exactly \nthat \num and so there's like an incredible \nopportunity here with tool use that I \nthink you know we're just beginning to \nscratch the surface of even the people \nwho have been thinking about this like \nconstantly since it came out \nyeah that was such a great tour of all I \nlove how you brought back tool former \nthat I think if you're mentioning \ngorilla it's good to cite that one as \nwell and then yeah the react tool use \nand um maybe I so yeah the open AI \nfunctions thing you mentioned your \nexperience in open in the open API specs \nand I I do find that whole Json \nformatting it functions the universal \ninterfaces and what openai's \naccomplished with that I really like \nthat but if we could transition just one \nI want to talk about a specific kind of \ntool which is this kind of like text to \nSQL kind of idea where you would fine \ntune a model to generate SQL queries I \nthink just if we could stay on this \nlittle microcosm of just this one \nexample and think through like is to me \nit sounds like and it's something that \nappeals a lot to wevia and is like you \nknow like having a say there's this \npaper called tiny stories where the \nheadline of the paper is how small can \nwe make these models and they still are \nable to talk to us and so it's like if \nwe could have a you know a 30 million \nparameter model that we could just wrap \nup in a Docker can container served on a \nCPU I think you could probably Onyx and \nmakes neural magic make it run fast but \nlike that kind of thing of something we \ncould put into eviate and I'm sure there \nare other examples out there and other \nkinds of software \nyeah yeah I definitely think \num \nyeah so the the flow that I just \ndescribed is very much something that \nyou need a large scale model to handle \num because you're going to be picking up \nsemantic information from the natural \nlanguage in a spec it's sort of like \nit's like it's reading documentation \nwhile also kind of like parsing the \ncontents and then we're generating this \nuh like in this particular format and we \nprobably also want to be able to like \ninteract in natural language as as part \nof building those things yeah so that's \nvery like large very capable \num uh language model territory So you \nyou're expecting to get that from a \nfoundation model provider uh so with \nbut if you have a specific domain where \nyou want to uh where you want to use a \nlanguage model but you want it to like \nsort of interact with symbolic software \nuh more directly than you yeah you get \nand that that domain is fairly narrow \nyou're only generating SQL you're only \ngenerating python code \num then maybe you can get away with much \nmuch smaller models I would worry a \nlittle bit about \nI think if you took an extremely large \nmodel and you somehow collected a \ntrillion tokens worth of SQL and natural \nlanguage paired with SQL it's like \nyou know interesting to think what kinds \nof capabilities would you get out of \nthat like could you just ask it to write \nyou know \num \nto effectively like write your whole uh \nyour whole database \num like as opposed to just like writing \none one one query \num but yeah uh that's that's definitely \nthe the like narrower tool use can \ninvolve narrower interfaces than just \nsome like generic thing like open API or \nJson schema or whatever and can just be \nlike yeah we want something that that \ngenerates SQL will run that SQL \nyeah I mean this conversation is really \ninspiring my interest to run this \nexperiment where you would like use gbt \nfor whatever to generate a big training \ndata set to then distill the SQL thing \ninto I guess like every input would take \nin the schema and the natural language \nquestion you know like the kind of like \nspecial token separation like you do \nwith like Bert and stuff and yeah I mean \nI think because I don't know if we've \nhad this kind of experiment where you \nwhere you scale the data without scaling \nthe model and then into a narrow domain \nI'd like to call that like generative \ndata augmentation some kind of phrase \nlike that \nyeah definitely people have started to \nlook at that I think there's like with \ninstruction fine-tuning that you know \nwhich includes the like crop of uh South \nAmerican camelid named \num instruction following fine tunes like \nllama uh or sorry like uh alpaca vacuna \nguanaco Etc I think we've run out I \nthink we're out of uh uh people will \nhave to find a new mammal to name things \nafter \num but uh \nlike that crop \nif you look back even before that people \nwere looking at generating data with GPT \nto even gpt3 \num uh to generate instruction look like \ninstruction type data \num and have found that to work like \npretty well I wanna \nI forget whether the flan data set is \nconstructed in that manner it might it \nmight not have been but super natural \ninstructions natural instructions and \nSupernatural instructions both \nconstructed in that manner so there's \nlike a proof of concept with one of the \nsort of like biggest changes with \nlanguage models which is the switch over \nfrom like modeling texts to modeling \nresponses to instructions so I can \nimagine that that kind of like scale \nlike make a big data set \num uh with a capable model and fine-tune \na really small model I can see that \nworking uh working pretty well in a lot \nof domains \nyeah I don't want to get too off topic \nbut yeah when I first saw that like um I \nthink it was called like decision \nTransformer I think it's also a Berkeley \npaper where you where yeah you um it \nshows how similar like medical treatment \ndecision modeling is to language it's \nstill like sequence to see the key \ndifference being the sparse reward \ncompared to like the here's the \nsupervision episode but here so I think \nI want to stay earlier we had mentioned \nthis General topic of what I think is \nthe biggest question in full stack deep \nin like well I say like full stack \nretrieve augments or generation maybe is \na better phrase for it but like should \nyou fine-tune the retrieval model should \nyou fine-tune the large language model \nor both and what is this and so this is \none topic as we're talking about \ngenerative data augmentation we're \ntalking about sampling data from large \nlanguage models to train smaller models \nso I love this idea where you use the \nlarge language model to generate a \npotential query for a document and then \nthat's what you use to supervise the \ntraining of the embedding models I think \nit's so profound because you know I \nremember in the early days of wevia we \nwere talking about like we were building \nsite search it was like a thing before \nno we have it now but before people \nwould troll us on Twitter and say like \nwe've made us new app search for their \ndocumentation \nso we were like okay how are we gonna \nbuild this and one idea was like all \nright let's everyone write 10 questions \nfor each of the pages right and that's \nhow we're going to train our embedding \nmodel is \nso so that kind of like it solves the \ndata problem of you know the language \nmodel can write queries potentially yeah \nand I would say that it solves the cold \nstart problem for data is a better way \nof thinking about it it's like your data \nengine needs a cold start \num and the language models are one \nreally good way to do that they might \nyou know I've \nyou know a lot of there's this like \nemerging intuition about the highest \ncapability language models like ubd4 and \nClaude that they are like a um High \npercentile crowd worker uh it's like so \nso actually better than your median \ncrowd worker on many tasks uh and \nbut with crowd workers it's not like \npeople just like hooked up a direct \num data stream through Kafka from \nMechanical Turk that just like spat out \num data that went straight into tensors \nand turned into gradients like you know \nthere were systems around it and there \nwere and user data and like data that \nyou purchased dog food data um like you \ndescribed for weediate those were all \nadditional sources \num and so language model generated \ncontent is an additional data source it \nhas its own uh issues like language \nmodels really like language model \ncontent so they might give you Rosy \nevaluations of your performance uh on \nthat \num and I think you might lose you're \ngonna sample well from the like high \nprobability regions of documents at \nleast high probability regions of \ndocuments produced on the internet that \nend up in the in these pre-training sets \nwhen it the like long tail of requests \nis going to be really challenging I know \nJoe bergam \num at Vespa has talked about how there's \nlike the bulk of queries and the long \ntail of queries and the long tail of \nqueries like is in ends up being nearly \nas important as the bulk because you \nknow \num in this in the same way it is for \nrequests right you look at your requests \nyou look at your your you're you're \nrunning an API on your request and \nyou're like 99 of my requests are \nresolved in 100 milliseconds or less \nthat's great like all 99 of my users are \nseeing a Snappy website it's like no no \nhold on one percent of the time while \nyou're doing some tasks in this website \nyou hit something that takes maybe five \nseconds \num and a user like that even if it's \nsampled at random if a user is like \ntaking many actions they're gonna see it \npretty soon \num and so similarly even though like the \nlong tail \nof potential requests is is rare thought \nof as individually it might be every \nuser has a request that they make that's \nin the long tail and so language models \nin generating data are likely to \ngenerate things that look like the bulk \nof queries not things that look like the \nlong tail uh and there's some research \non this curse of recursion \num uh that that has modeled this uh \nphenomenon and and shown it empirically \nand that's going to be a problem for \ngetting to that sticky really high \nquality product \num and so \nI would suspect like \num actually fully solving the like the \nthe problem of needing data train models \nis always going to involve a data Engine \nwith many diverse sources not just ask \ngpd4 to generate you 100 new data points \nyeah I love that and also that curse of \nrecursion that's an awesome title yeah I \nmean it it \num I give a quick shout out to a preview \na previous podcast with Professor Laura \nDietz on perspectives of using large \nlanguage models to annotate relevance \njudgments as an awesome paper and also \nI've got this Haystack cup here I \nunfortunately I put it in the dishwasher \nand that suck it down a little bit \nbut but they have this tool called Cupid \nfor uh labeling query it's just like \nsome interesting things for people \nlistening maybe it could be interested \nin referencing it but yes this long tail \nthing this is so interesting and I'd \nhate to kind of I don't want to get too \noff topic with generally this kind of \nretrieval language generation thing but \nlike I've kind of thought of like class \nimbalance and the inability to perform \nwell on minority sets of data is kind of \nthe Crux of self-driving cars I know I \nknow I'm pivoting topics yeah but like \nlike do you think like like I I've \nstarted to think that self-driving cars \nwith deep learning will never be \nrealized because of this problem \nyeah I definitely have entertained that \nhypothesis in the hypothesis in the past \nand now you know there's probably a \nvideo of me on YouTube Somewhere saying \nthat \num but uh there's two things there one \nis that in you know empirically I can \nget in a cruise automobile and take a \nride across \num across San Francisco with no driver \nit like I can pay money to do that and \nso it's kind of happening \num and there's lots of deep learning \ninvolved at lots of different parts of \nthe stack there's also lots of expert \nsystems involved but \num you know and lots of traditional \ncontrol and and linear quadratic \nregulators and stuff but but there's \ndeep learning in there for for for \nespecially for perception \num so so it's it's it is happening it's \nit took twice as long as people expected \ntypical for an engineering project \num and took a lot more Capital infusion \nthan than people expected but it seems \nto be happening \num I would say there are still long tail \nissues \num and people complain about behavior of \nthe cars \num \nand that \nis \nlike resolving that is still a hard \nproblem I would say that language maybe \nhelps a lot with this long tail problem \nin that um I don't know if there's like \na figure in the gpt4 white paper from \nopenai that shows how multimodality \nhelps \num and it's like asking it to describe \nthe content of a picture and the picture \nis of a man hanging off the back of a \ntaxi cab doing ironing and if you are a \nself-driving car and all you ever do is \nlike consume lidar \nyou will drive many many billions of \nmiles before you encounter a man hanging \noff the back of a taxi cab doing ironing \nand so like you or or even yeah like you \nyou might not even encounter any ironing \nuh you know for for billions of Miles uh \nbut if you have a if a component of the \nstack that's that's part of the \nperception is trained on a broader data \nset like the breadth of the entire \ninternet hundreds of billions of \ntrillions of tokens then it has a chance \nto find out about all these smaller \nConcepts that can be composed together \nand also to like knock out further into \nthe tail the things it has never seen \nbefore \num and so yeah like that that I think \nwill help with that kind of problem I \nthink there \num are problems with using really large \nTransformers uh you know in a uh in a \ncar from from power consumption and \num uh to like latency and all these \nother things but at least that feels \nlike an in principle way to um to help a \nlot with uh the long tail problem as it \nappears in self-driving cars \nEFS and I definitely could talk to you \nfor a while about self-driving cars it's \nso interesting but let me kind of bring \nthis back to kind of Surge and like \npeople building chat Bots and things \nlike that with our thing is like I guess \nI think about this like a lot of these \nlarge language models they've been \ntrained on like you know internet scale \ntext or maybe like Wikipedia you know \nthe breath is enormous but another thing \nabout the fine-tuning like you know if \nthe you know full stack Discord is a \nparticular pocket of that space right \nlike it to me just the intuition is that \nit would make so much sense to fine-tune \nit to put it over into that space yeah \nyeah definitely I think um the Laura \npaper is truly incredible the low rank \nadaptation paper from uh from Microsoft \nresearch and it's like like people are \naware of this like fine-tuning method um \nbut they like and they're aware that \nit's good and they should use it or \nwhatever \num but I feel like people haven't seen \nthe paper has a bunch of really great \ninsights in it \num and one of those one one class of \ninsight that's in it is that \num they actually like analyzed what the \nhell is going on in these fine-tuned \nlayers like what are they doing and what \nit looks like \nfrom what they have in that uh in that \nlittle uh more sciency section it looks \nlike what they're doing is reordering \nthe like eigenvalues of every Matrix so \nthey're taking like Loosely speaking \nthey're taking the concepts that the \nlanguage model already has so like \noperations language model already likes \nto do and re-ranking them and saying no \nactually this behavior is really \nimportant and it's behavior that we used \nto think was important is less so like \nlet's shrink our behavior in One \nDirection and like increase our behavior \nin another Direction \num so like more so than say like \ndiscovering an entirely new direction to \nfocus in \num and that sort of explains how you can \nget really profound changes in the \nmodel's Behavior without necessarily \nincreasing their intelligence or \ncapability which is what we've seen from \nlike uh Lima and the false promise of of \nimitating uh proprietary lens paper that \nyou aren't necessarily making and even \nthe guanica paper like you aren't \nnecessarily making the model that much \nsmarter by fine-tuning it you're just \nlike changing the manner in which it \nproduces outputs you're revealing things \nthat it sort of was already capable of \ndoing that was in the probability \ndistribution over the vocabulary at the \nend that was present inside of those um \ninside of those big residual stream \nvectors inside the model but was like \nrelatively down weighted because it \nwasn't important during pre-train or was \nit important during rohf and supervised \nfine-tuning but in your uh final \nDownstream fine-tuning case it's super \nimportant to uh to like you know use \nthis particular style of diction or to \num like refer to a particular noun and \nso we can just sort of pull those things \nout and reduce \num uh relatively other things \nyeah it's amazing it's so there's there \nare kind of two things to that I want to \npick apart I mean quickly there's \nrecently we had the voting podcast \nStephanie horvachesky and gunjan butter \nare you where we talked about how you \ncan put image embeddings into the latent \nspace of like level lens and somehow \nthat works like somehow it's able to to \ndo that and like mentioning the \neigenvectors so maybe for people \nlistening you know weight Matrix you \ntake that Matrix and you decompose it \nwith singular value decomposition you \nhave like USV that kind of thing and \nthen the eigenvectors like that diagonal \nand like the rank of it is like how many \nso like the diagonal of this eigenvector \nis is like uh how import how the \nimportant components of it I you know \nthinking about projected and residual \ncomponents is always a \nyeah yeah I I'd say the like the like \nshort version of that um the like very \nsoftware engineering version of that is \nthat the eigenvectors Define the \nindependent things going on inside of a \nmatrix \num so you could think of them as like \nlike a bunch of asynchronous operations \nall going on \num and because this is linear algebra \neach one has a different like weight on \nit a different importance and so those \nare those are the weights of those uh of \nthose eigenvectors actually you know for \nthe real math nerds these are all \nsingular values and singular vectors so \nI'm not committing a math crime uh here \nuh they're they're real valued um and \nand maybe even positive \num but uh yeah so they each of these \nlittle asynchronous procedures has an \nimportance weight attached to it and \nwith when I say that we're like \nre-ranking them I'm saying that we take \nsome like one of the processes was like \nsimulate what Homer Simpson would say in \nthis situation and that's not that \nimportant in web pre-training because \nonly a small fraction of documents on \nthe web have Homer Simpson in them but \nyou do still need to learn it if you \nwant to get to the quality of language \ngeneration the gpd4 has but if you're \nfine-tuning the model to sound like \nHomer Simpson all of a sudden that \nprocess becomes really important and so \nyou increase its weight you increase its \nrank \num so that's a a hand hand wavy \nwhiteboardy uh uh software Engineers \napproach to understanding what that \nmeans \nyeah it's so there's definitely \napplications of this in Vector search as \nwell like you know there's this paper \ncalled hsw finger and it looks like \nthere is a lot of opportunities for us \nto look at like you know projecting \nvectors onto other vectors but I do stay \nup like I I've always thought that like \ndisentangled representation learning was \njust like an unsolvable problem like \neven if it's the eigenvector where you \nyou know disentangle the components of \nit I \nI I don't know like because sometimes \npeople when you're explaining Vector \nsearch to people you'll say like this \ndimension of the vector says how much of \nHomer Simpson is this one says how much \nof this it is and it's like no that's \nactually it's totally like entangled \nacross the vector yeah yeah and so yeah \nthe um the goal of eigenvector G \ncomposition is to like find a basis in \nwhich you know to sort of rotate the \nthing around so that you can actually \nsee oh this is the Homer Simpson \nDimension and this is the plural versus \nnot plural Dimension or whatever and \nthere's been limited success in doing \nthose kinds of things to understand the \ninternals of Transformers \num but yeah definitely uh individual \nneurons individual components of those \nvectors don't seem to have a huge amount \nof like independent meaning \num and honestly I don't think you would \nnecessarily want that to be the case you \ncan if you try to store information in \nthose like n Dimensions you're stuck \nwith the N dimensions of your embedding \nspace and that n is pretty large for a \nlarge trans former I forget what it is \nfor gpt3 like low thousands probably \num maybe 10 000. but like real like it's \na it's that number you and you're and \nyou're and it's the amount you can store \nif you pick different dimensions to \nstore different things is linear if you \nrelax that and say I don't want to have \nlike n completely orthogonal directions \num I just want them to be like mostly \northogonal to each other I want their \ndot products not to be exactly zero but \nI'll let them be like \na little bit different from zero um and \nthat I'll still consider that or yeah \nlike I'll still consider that like \num those two unrelated vectors now all \nof a sudden you have exponentially sized \nmemory storage \num and so it's like what people have \nfound from looking at Transformer \ninternals is that's what they're doing \nwith that with that Transformer uh \nresidual stream there's like you know if \nyou want to know what's in it you have \nto look at every Dimension and do like a \nDOT product \num with some query rather than looking \nat some specific Dimension to figure out \nwhether a piece of information is like \ntrue or false or what value it has \nyeah I think without a question there's \nmore like that it's so interesting and \nsuch a great topic but I think like if \nwe could pivot into maybe explaining \nLaura a little more and how low rank \nadaptation works so again so you can \ntake the weight Matrix and you can \ndecompose it into eigenvector like you \ncan Recon construct The Matrix from the \ndecomposition and so the idea is you can \njust update these uh the low rank \nprojection with the fine tuning and then \nyou and then you have like this sparse \nfind and it's like the latest update in \nsparse fine-tuning where to update like \na 12 billion parameter I don't know why \nI said 12 like big model to you can \nupdate a subset of it and then if a \nbillion needs to count as as big you \nknow even though like Megatron Ln paper \nI want to say is like low 10 billions in \nscale but now that's like oh that's like \na small Fun open source Model 12 yeah \num yeah I think something that you had \ntold me about in our brainstorming \nsession is this and something like \nsomething for I think more casual like \npeople who are just kind of hacking \ntogether applications with alleviate in \nthe opening API in this idea that if the \nLaura fine tuning thing becomes more \naccessible one idea would be if we have \na Discord chat bot you have a separate \nset of weights for Connor and a separate \nset of weights for Charles you know and \nso on what do you think about that idea \ncan you tell me more about it yeah yeah \nit's really cool I think we don't have \nthe infrastructure place to do that like \nand there's a bit of a bearish so a bit \nof a bit of a bearish signal on that \nfront if you look at the um image \ngeneration world uh which uh I I you \nknow I spend a lot of my time thinking \nabout the language modeling World \num and that you know that's what I'm \nspending a ton of my time and thought \nbut I recently built like a little QR \nCode art generator and so I like checked \nout what's what's going on in stable \nFusion world and \num they have been productizing \nFoundation models for way longer than \nthe language modeling world has because \nthey had their moment of like broad \naccessibility earlier right we still \nhaven't quite had our \num stable diffusion moment in language \nmodels uh which is to say like an \nextremely highly capable model with \ncompletely open weights that can be run \non consumer gpus at like and all these \nuh like all these things we're still \njust a little bit short we need like um \nwe need something as smart as text \nDaVinci 2 but that you can run on like \n140 GB card \num and so maybe even by the time this \npodcast is released that'll already be \ntrue like who knows it could happen any \nsecond \num but yeah so so in the in this world \nthey people have been people who have \nbeen building stuff and they have \ndiscovered different uses for fine tunes \nand like control net as a way of like \nmerging multiple fine tunes together but \nbut so far as I can tell they don't have \nanything that looks like that dream that \nyou just uh put out there of like I have \none set of Weights that's very small \nmegabytes in size that adjust the \nbehavior of this language model for one \nuser and then I have another one equally \nsmall that I can hot swap in actually \nwith like a Cuda operation it's just \nMatrix math to swap out a Laura fine \ntune \num and then so like on the Fly switch \nover and now I'm doing it for a \ndifferent user different user Persona a \ndifferent region whatever your your \napproaches for segmenting out your fine \ntunes \num that doesn't seem to be the way \nthings work it seems like mostly people \nlike download the entire weights for \nevery model that they want to use and \nthen like even if they are related by \nsome lineage \num so it's a bit of a barrier signal for \nwhether this is going to actually get \nadopted in the language modeling world \nyou need some kind of like shared manner \nof expressing where these weights should \ngo \num and and making it possible to like \nget merge uh like one fine tune with \nanother \num or uh yeah or all these things that \nyou would want to make it really um \nuh really good so like right now there \nare probably people doing that \ninternally who've built uh some Jank \nversion of that but there's no like open \nstandard \num that everybody can use that that \nsolves that problem \nyeah I I I guess I think like there's \ncertainly potential for that in the \nfuture I guess for now we're seeing like \nyou kind of do like role playing \nprompting or like personalized prompting \nwhere I'd be like here's an example of \nhow Conor writes his emails kind of and \nlike or like you know kind of likes \nbasketball could you tailor this \nadvertisement to Conor and then it's \nlike hey come play basketball yeah \nprompting yeah as always prompting takes \nlike 30 seconds to try and gets you 70 \nof the way there yeah \nyeah and it works like retrieval \naugmentation Works super well \num and then like you know hammering down \nthat last uh bit then takes you know you \nhave to you have to move over to using \nfine you have to move over to like \nredoing the pre-training um yeah uh \nwhatever and \nuh \nyeah so that's \nuh like a pretty pretty typical pattern \num and so starting off with like per \nuser prompts is a good way to at least \nstart seeing okay what do users need \nbefore they prefer a user \num uh a user specific model to the base \nmodel \num or what are the right ways to break \nthis down like what information is user \nspecific versus what is generic and \nmaybe like you can imagine like a \nhierarchy of like you have individual \nusers all the way at the bottom you have \na single model for all users all the way \nat the top and then you have different \nways of partitioning your users and \nhaving a specific prompt or fine-tune \num or or other kinds of different \nBehavior at each point in that uh in \nthat power set of partitions and uh like \nuh figuring out what the right ways to \nthink about that are with prompting is a \ngreat way to save yourself a lot of pain \nand time uh and any 100 time \nyeah I mean I think it's kind of coming \ninto like it's like the the Grand Arch \ntheme of our podcast is like you know ml \nOps full stack deep learning and I think \nthis is coming into this kind of \nmonitoring and observability sort of \ntopic with respect to like uh embedding \nspace visualization where like it's hard \nto just segment Charles and Connor you \nknow however many people because we're \nso abstractly defined but we have this \nlike visualization of clusters \nand yes maybe you just set the stage how \nare you thinking about like yeah this \ncluster visualization I think of it as \njust a super powerful way for people to \nstart collecting data and then for more \npeople who are you know software who \ndon't who don't come from like training \noptimizing Cuda kernels like people who \nare just trying to add it to their apps \nI think this idea that you can start \ncollecting some input output examples \nstart labeling them on what I like what \nI don't like and then maybe just see \nthose colored green and red when you put \nthose inputs back into the latent space \nand I think these kind of charts I think \nthat's a huge middle ground for going \nfrom this zero shot rag stack we're \ntalking about into the you know the ml \nOps World the weights and bias all that \nlike I think this middle part of this \nVision that I think that could be a huge \nevangelist for this yeah yeah I think um \nI personally have benefited a little bit \nfrom that like um I had a little uh for \nthe uh for the Discord bot \num I pushed just like pushed it through \nT Snee actually using the like built-in \nversion of it inside of weights and \nbiases upload just like upload some \nvectors from the vector store with their \nmetadata attached and then just project \nthem look at them in 2D and it \nimmediately revealed that there was like \na large chunk of data from some PDFs \nthat looks like it's like mangled \nUnicode bytes or like somebody like \nincluded their latec program inside of \ntheir PDF in a weird way and so it's \njust garbage it's just like garbage \ndisgusting it's basically a failure of \nmy like data loading and validation \npipeline to not recognize that that was \nnot suitable input and now because dot \nproducts are are pretty good \num like I'm not ever seeing that in \nproduction like I'm not seeing those \ngetting pulled in and like mangling my \ncontext but I'm wasting money embedding \nthose I'm wasting uh database space \nholding on to them and maybe there is \ngood information in there if I had a \ndifferent pre-processing pipeline to \npull that out so that's like you know \nthat that's the kind that like very base \nlevel Insight that comes from not even \nfull-on observability but just the like \nbarest forms of monitoring \num and the like bearish forms of \ndashboarding and visualization there's a \nton of value to be unlocked there \num and that's yep that's definitely what \nI saw when uh when working at weights \nand biases that it's just like just \nbeing able to see the GPU utilization \nreally easily and being able to be like \nwait a second it's like way lower than \nit was three weeks ago what the hell \njust happened like that is will give you \na ton of gains that going further \nrequires you to do a ton of additional \ninstrumentation and a lot of hard work \nthat often is like not very long lasting \nand needs to be like adjusted and and \nhas needs like constant engineer \nmaintenance and these like simple things \nlike just take the vectors and tissue \nthem and look at them every once in a \nwhile gets you a huge chunk of the way \nyeah it's a it's just amazing like when \nyou're curating data sets for language \nmodeling you have so much data you \nreally have no clue what's in it so this \nkind of yeah Unicode clusters and I've \nseen that for myself it's pretty funny \nobviously I I would love to transition \ninto this topic of GPU utilization a \nlittle more right admittedly know very \nlittle about it but this kind of yeah \nlike what maybe if you could just set \nthe stage with any topic that interests \nyou and we could go from there oh yeah I \nmean I don't have that much super \ninteresting to say about it and now that \npeople are mostly using things via \num you know that that story and that \ncomment came from uh my time awaits and \nbiases and at a time when there was much \nless Foundation model use \num and a lot more a lot more training \nand running things yourself \num so I don't know that I have too much \nuh interesting to say there except that \nif you've never run a profiler that \ngives you like both profile level stats \nand critically like a trace view \num uh for a GPU accelerated job just \nlike stop what you're doing and like get \neven just like an end this tutorial run \nit and then I you know ideally also a \nmodel that you care about you have \nrunning uh in production or or that \nyou're you're working on just to like it \nuh substantially improved my intuition \nfor what pytorch was what Cuda was uh \nlike What GPU acceleration means for \nneural networks just to see this \num uh just see this trace of uh like a \nyou know like a flame graph type Trace \nwith uh for the CPU for the GPU in its \nstreams and to relate that back to the \nkinds of metrics you might see in Nvidia \nSMI or in weights and biases \num it's uh something that web developers \num like don't even know how good they \nhave it like they can be running their \napplication in a browser they play like \nlike three buttons and all of a sudden \nthey have a perfectly recorded \nreplayable visual trace of of uh of of \nwhat happened in their program and like \nit's that's a similarly awesome \nexperience for understanding the browser \nthe Dom the uh like the event Loop like \nall the pieces that make a web \napplication work \num you can get a ton of insight from \nlooking at those traces same thing \napplies to uh to tracing your GPU \naccelerated uh workloads \nyeah that's that's been one of the from \njoining weeviate and seeing the inside \nof like a legit engineering company \ncompared to like my PhD that's been one \nof the big eye opening things for me \nI've ever seen those like stacked Trace \ngraphs and thinking what is that or it's \nlike you're spending this much time on \nthe distance computation this much time \nlike updating the end like all this kind \nof stuff with the hsw so with GPU \nprofiling do you usually look at like I \ndidn't know about like idle uh like idle \ntime between when you're kind of like \nsending the gradients and you're looking \nfor the next like just batch of data \nkind of pretty abstractly but do you \nmaybe profile it like layer by layer \nlike how fine-grained does profiling GPU \nutilization get yeah um so the \nprofiling tends to be like here's the \noperations that you ran like with some \nlevel of granularity here's how long \nthey took like on average and here's \nlike some some uh quantiles so that that \ncan be useful but I find I I find \nand that is especially useful when \nyou're like really knocking down like \nand just continuing to go and like make \nsomething faster and faster and faster \nso that's very much a post product \nMarket fit kind of like this is a really \nworking feature and we're now spending \n10 of our time running this workload \nlet's make that let's try and get that \n10x faster \num we don't it hasn't changed in a \nquarter we don't expect it to change \nthis year let's spend some time on it \num with tracing where you just see like \na single or a small number of executions \nthat is more useful as like a thing you \ndo anytime you're you're running \nsomething because you can catch these \nvery gross features that are like \nunintuitive about the behavior of your \nprogram \num just like as an example \num like I was Consulting with somebody \nand they were like I'll take a look at \nmy deep learning stack and I um \nlike just quickly ran their model \nthrough this profiler and it was like \npart way through their forward pass \nthe CPU stops the GPU stops there's this \nlike giant block of like something is \ngoing on not in pytorch but elsewhere in \nPython for like a third of every forward \npass and it turned out they were \ndynamically constructing a python class \non the forward pass just like you know \nin Python you don't often think that \nhard about like am I dynamically \nconstructing this class or am I \nconstructing it ahead of time and then \nlike you know uh like referring back to \nthat definition it's like normally you \ndon't have to like that's not slow \nenough that it slows down the execution \nof your program but once you're in a hot \nLoop like uh a model training Loop you \nknow 100 milliseconds matters \num 100 milliseconds can be an eternity \neven if um you know depending on on what \nyou're running \nuh and so just like simply moving the \ndefinition of this class from like oh \nit's like dynamically constructed in the \nmiddle of the forward pass to oh we \nconstruct it ahead of time and and just \nreuse that definition just like yank \nyanked that entire 100 milliseconds out \nand saved a third of like shaped 30 off \ntheir training time \num and so that's the kind of insight \nlike you can maybe see it at the level \nof Kernel utilization which is the usual \nkind of metric people look at but \ndiagnosing it requires looking at traces \nand profiles to be like oh aha here's a \nsurprising like place where time is \nbeing spent and this is what's going on \nwhen those kernels aren't being utilized \nuh that's is amazing I think it I think \nit's a really amazing topic I feel like \nthis is the thing that really separates \nthese like super valuable AI companies \nand I think a lot of like I think a lot \nabout training embedding models and I \nthink kind of two perspectives of like \nhow you initialize the loss function \nyeah like you might create a class the \nloss function is something that people \ndo and with these um you know with the \ncontrast of loss and how you how you \nbuild that in I think also just like the \nthe data loaders and how you're going to \nsample the positive negative Pairs and I \nthink there's probably just a crazy \namount of opportunity to optimize these \nkind of things but yeah so so I I think \nthat was a really really interesting \ndiscussion but I want to kind of step \nback into a more high level space and \nmaybe if you could tell me about your \nexperience with building the um the full \nstack deep learning uh Discord q a bot \noh yeah yeah \num yeah so I put that together \nso what what is this thing \num it's q a over full stack deep \nlearning the course full stack llm boot \ncamp \num and then also my uh llm paper lit \nreview notion database uh so all those \nare our sources and \num we got some YouTube videos we got \nsome web pages we got some PDFs and it's \nbasically like natural language search \nover those documents natural language \nquestion answering over those documents \nand I first built it back in January for \nthe scale AI hackathon which was a \nreally sort of like fun there's now like \na hackathon every two hours in San \nFrancisco \num \nlike yeah uh got a text from a friend \nlike oh do you want to go to this \nhackathon tonight I'm like uh \nunfortunately I'm going to a different \nhackathon like three blocks away \num but yeah this was back in January \nthey um they had the hackathon and I was \nlike well what you know what can I what \ncan we do right now q a was starting to \nemerge and like retrieve augmentation of \nstudying through marriages like a common \napplication pattern \num and the \num and so it was like clear could be \ndone pretty straightforwardly and you \nknow we get a lot of questions in our \nDiscord where it's like oh you know let \nme point you to this lecture where we \ntalked about that oh here's the paper \nthat's relevant to that question and \nit's like oh I'd love to automate away \nthat part of my job \num so that I leave like if there's a \nsuper interesting question maybe I can \nfollow up on it or um uh if the question \nisn't easily answerable I can follow up \non it \num so that was like the vision and it \nwas possible to put together like a a \nvery Jank demo in like an hour and then \nto have like an actually decent ux by \nthe end of the hackathon like um like it \nhad \nyou know embeds and I want to say I even \nalso shipped the like give Emoji \nfeedback feature of like thumbs up \nthumbs down uh within the hackathon \num but the the GitHub history can tell \nyou whether I'm I'm uh lying at this \npoint or not uh but uh but yeah so then \nit was that's that is we've stuck with \nthat we've continued to run it and and \nit's sort of one place where I get some \nexperience with like what is it what is \nit like to have one of these things \nrunning in production so like on the \ndelightful side \num when I switched it over to gpt4 oh it \ngot it on smarter and also it's now \nmultilingual so I woke up one morning to \nfind that um somebody had been asking \nquestions about radio in Swahili and uh \nfrom what I could tell as a non-speaker \nabsolutely just using Google translate \nand and chat GPT it was responding in \nfluent Swahili with uh with like correct \nanswers and sources and links to my \nvideos \num so uh that's you know if there's like \ndelightful X experiences of users \ndiscovering features of these models and \nways to use the ways to use the \napplication I would have wouldn't have \nanticipated \num and then there's also \num you know the sadder Parts where it's \nlike oh geez Like You Know It uh \nsometimes just like completely made \nup and like sometimes users ask it \nreally weird stuff and it responds in a \nweird way back to them uh and uh oh yeah \nand sometimes it goes down sometimes \nopen AI goes down \num sometimes the modal goes down \num like uh yeah it turns out it's you \nknow interacting with a with a database \nis hard and the code you write in an \nhour is not good code for interacting \nwith the database so those kinds of \nthose kinds of discoveries \num how exactly that happens in the LOM \nworkflow have also come out of sort of \nrunning this thing \nI think the first question I want to ask \nyou about this is you know as a content \ncreator and I feel like that's kind of \nthe mutual bond we share is making deep \nlearning content for a long time and you \nknow understanding sort of the like how \nyou try to grab everyone's attention and \nall that kind of good stuff is like the \nis like this ability to \nyou know automate the content creator \nturn the content creator into this \nartifact I mean you mentioned sometimes \nyou get bad responses but it's like it \nseems like this will just completely \nchange how we think right now of content \ncreators like uh you know I don't know \nMr Beast is like if I don't know if he's \na good example of one but like you know \nthese these you know Educators people \nwho I think Thomas Frank is a is a \nYouTuber famous for notion tutorials or \nlike General lifestyle advice and so \nit's like turning himself into a chat \nbot shortly this will change just social \nmedia broadly \nright yeah yeah that's an interesting \nidea I think yeah \num framing it as like automating myself \num is more fun and cute than it is like \na legitimate statement of what these \nthings are capable of I definitely have \nbeen you know I've been experimenting \nwith the uh with audio generation with \nuberduck and 11 Labs \num to like generate \num you know things that sound like me on \na podcast \num I promise I'm not using that right \nnow I don't know how I can prove it to \nanybody listening to this \num but uh the \nuh so like you know you there definitely \nseem to be some pieces that are there \nbut like full end-to-end automation is \nalways challenging right if you look \neven at like very sophisticated software \nshops there are limits to what they're \nable to automate even in this like \nin principle Halcyon world of software \nwhere everything is bits flowing through \nmachines that should behave \ndeterministically \num and so I would say I'm a little I'm \nbearish on the sh in in the short term \non things like fully automating yourself \num but finding ways to like take things \nthat you are doing with your time that \nare low value that are repetitive but \ncontext dependent or like require \ninterfacing with natural language \num you know uh that are in the end like \nkind of low effort things that you are \ndoing \num taking those and replacing them uh so \nthat you then take that time you're \nspending on that and then can re-index \nonto the higher effort stuff that feels \nlike a more \num that's like achievable right now like \nlike there are there are wins you can \nfind right now for that and so that's \nthat's how I'm my current mental model \nfor it um the point in which uh content \ncreators are defined as as points within \nembedding space plus a small \nneighborhood \num you know that uh that feels uh feels \nfairly far away \nyeah I guess it's just like I think \nabout \nyeah like exactly like you say like the \num you know I the automating the more \nyou know repetitive low-level tasks to \nlet you think in higher levels of \nabstraction is like always amazing I \njust think also kind of like the multi \nlike you mentioned the how do I fix this \nradio bug in Swahili like I think the \nway it unlocks the global market it it \nalso can create like hyper \ncompetitiveness now because like you \nknow the top five percent can also scale \nlike they can deliver the personal touch \nthat through the language models and \nstuff like that yeah and yeah yeah so I \nguess it just I feel like the content \ncreators have actually the market is \ngrowing and yeah definitely definitely \nand and yeah I would say it's like \npeople already from the like last \ngeneration of machine learning people \nthis idea of like drudgery or or certain \nkinds of like menial tasks could be \nautomated and like you know many of them \ncould have been automated with a \nspreadsheet \num uh much less or much less gpt4 but \nthere's all also the the you you \nsuggested this initially as like you \nknow a content creator automating \nthemselves as a chatbot they're that is \nlike that's maybe not the same thing as \nlike full automation like full \nreplacement of the role served by a \ncontent creator with a machine but it \ndoes it is like a much less machine like \num thing that people were doing was like \nyou know interacting with a person \nunderstanding what they want and trying \nto give them what they want \num it's just that often when you are \ndoing that you only need to do it at a \nvery like superficial level or it's you \nknow once you have the context of the \ndocument that has the answer it's like \nas straightforward as copy pasting with \na little bit of editing like that's much \nfurther along the Spectrum from uh what \nwe think of as machines to what we think \nof uh what we think of as labor for \nmachines to what we think of his labor \nfor humans \num and uh so definitely there is a push \nin that direction from from highly \ncapable language models \nyeah I agree 100 I think like there's \nthis other concept of like the language \nmodels that produced the novel content \nlike the language model you know through \nmaybe retrieve augmented generation \nwhere it like retrieves this part of the \npassage as part of this tries to come up \nwith like novel insights I don't know \nexactly like but like you've tuned the \nlanguage model however it does this it \nproduces some kind of blog post and that \nmakes me think even more of the power of \nlike your personal brand because it's \nlike as the content platforms become \nflooded with this kind of content it's \nlike that Charles tweeted it that or you \nknow however the medium platform that's \nlike what that that stamp of human brand \nis going to be so valuable \nyeah yeah I would say \num the essential post-modern artist is \nthe DJ whose Artistry is in test and \nselection and presentation of what a \nprevious uh mode of Productions artists \ncreated and it with uh language models \nperhaps we can effectively all become \nDJs of text \num mixing together things generated by \num generated by models uh with with \nmaybe just adding a nice light four on \nthe floor beat underneath them as we as \nwe mix them together \nyeah I I mean like for me my opportunity \nhas mostly been not in producing novel \npapers but more in just echoing what I \nfind is interesting and like that's \nthrough experimenting with the \nalgorithms and what is successful like \nif I review like a paper from Sergey \nLevine on offline reinforcement learning \ngonna do better than me just saying hey \nthis is these are just my thoughts on \nthis topic \nyeah so I wanted to ask you also a \ntechnical question about this which is \nyou mentioned notion page YouTube the \nofficial course material you have these \ndifferent uh sources of data and then \nyou put it into like a vector database \nhow do you think about like the schema \ndesign for different sources do you have \nlike a yeah \num well uh I've been using mongodb for \nmy uh for My Level of storage which is a \ncommitment to not have a schema I I you \nknow the you you can you can have a a \nloose an application layer-defined \nschema which is uh easier than a \ndatabase layer defined schema \num but the the real thing there is it's \nlike still figuring out what exactly \ndoes this look like what should what \nmust it have what might it have in a \ndocument \num yeah I would say like your questions \nwhen you have like multiple sources hmm \nthere's like a certain scale at which \nyou can no longer be very precious about \nyour handling of sources and you have to \nbe very generic I think you end up \ngetting like worse results if all you're \ndoing is saying like \num documents are going to be like \nannotated with what are their H1 and H2 \nheadings \num but like you know coming from \nmarkdown or HTML but that that means \nsomething very different in different \nwebsites like it has a particular \nmeaning like H2 has a particular meaning \ninside of our online course notes but \nthat's like not what it means on some \nother page \num and uh yeah we have chapters in our \nYouTube videos I use the chapters as \nlike metadata during processing and \nlater and that's also like chapters can \nhave different meanings when you're \nconsuming different types of YouTube \nvideos and like that \nlike injecting a little bit of knowledge \nthere can go a long way to increasing \nthe quality of generations and \nfundamentally like why do we like why do \nwe have this it's because we need to \ntake documents that are longer than the \ncontext length and eventually get them \ndown to the context length and you want \nto start I think with like splitting up \nyour documents at their joints like \nsplitting them up by sensible like ways \nto split them chapters headings whatever \nsub document type thing and it's and \nthen only after that when it's time to \ndecide what's going to go into the \nlanguage model do you actually chunk it \nto something smaller like maybe a few \nhundred tokens at a time but you just \nmake sure you don't cut across any like \nreally serious seams in your document \num so like that's one of the that's one \nof the like primary things to think \nabout \num and then I guess the other thing it's \nsort of like a um application \narchitecture kind of level is like I \nthink of the vector \nthe like embedding vectors \nand Vector storage as an index \ninto this information so an index in a \ndatabase is something like we've already \nstored the data and then we add an index \nright so we might add an index that's \nprefix reg X based and this is it like \npre-competes a bunch of stuff for us and \nstores it in a data structure that then \nallows us to make certain queries really \nreally fast \nand that's effectively how we how like \nevery application that I have used and \nlike embeddings \num for has been to do that right and \nlike when I when you think of a database \nit's about a lot more than just like an \nindex it's like I want to like I want to \nversion these things maybe I want time \ntravel maybe I want stored procedures \nlike it's a whole bunch of other stuff \num and so Vector storage like feels as \nas I have used it in a rag pipeline a \nlot more like an index \num and so like you kind of want to \nseparate out this is the current state \nof this document Corpus \nmay be split into subdocuments this is \nthe current state of it and then this is \nthe index over it using a particular \nstrategy of chunking a particular \nembedding model whatever that then is \nwhat the application directly touches \num yeah yeah I think like my current \nunderstanding is that the best way to do \nthis would be to have one class for just \ntext chunks like all every Chunk from \nevery Source however long it ends up \nbeing like 100 tokens or you Max it out \nat the 512 tokens all lives in one \nvector index with symbolic properties \nfor like notion YouTube or like title if \nthe page has such a thing and then so \nfrom that one index where you build one \nhsw graph with like you know however \nmuch you have possibly you also kind of \nwould add that extra structure in \nseparate classes so like you know this \nis like the master chunk class and then \nand then you have like the notion class \nor like the YouTube class I kind of \nthink like that kind of symbolic \nseparation is the best way and then you \ncan kind of \nlike we have this one thing and we've \nmade this called the group by filter \nwhere it's like a book has like it let's \nsay we have two different books and one \nhas ten chunks another has eight that \nmatch our query like in the top 100 of \nour query you know so you would group it \nand then you would rank the at the book \nlevel based on how many passage passages \nhave matched it so I think that's like \none way of just using metadata again in \nsearch that we talked about earlier \nagain but there's this other idea of \nlike maybe using graph structure to flow \nembeddings through the graph it's kind \nof like a Knowledge Graph idea or like \nmaybe \nby graph graph convolutional networks \nthat could like that would like take \neach chunk and use its kind of context \nin the graph of like you know blog posts \nsites this other blog posts in addition \nto just this kind of like where it \nSource from in addition its relation to \nother things I just think there's like \nsome cool things we can do by thinking \nfurther about this I'm sorry that's not \ntoo concrete but no yeah I don't know as \nmuch about the \num Knowledge Graph world in the graph \ndatabase world I think like definitely \nthe and like people in NLP have been \nthinking a lot about this it is kind of \nit feels to me a lot like the branch of \nNLP that has been \num like basically obliterated by the \nrise of large language models um but \nthat doesn't mean they can't have a \ntriumphant return \num so I I have talked definitely talked \nwith some people who are thinking about \nknowledge graph approaches and \num yeah I can see that working pretty \nwell for being like Oh what are the \nrelated what are related documents maybe \nthey don't embed the same maybe they are \nsemantically very different from the \nperspective of embedding but they're \nrelated by this by this graph and yeah \nthat's uh \nyeah that's that kind of uh link based \nranking is obviously very good for \nsearch or else \num you know \nuh yeah I wouldn't have been using Gmail \nto communicate with you about a Google \nmeet um \nyeah uh but yeah so uh yeah I see \nthere's there yeah the the thing that I \nsaid about like there's an index and a \nseparate document store like that's uh \nyou get you can enhance that a lot by \ncreating a full-on database with \nintegrated search that uses metadata \nthat metadata is used to construct \nindices that have both like a vector \nhnsw type index but also have the \nmetadata as like \num additional flags that are used to \nconstruct indices that allow like very \nrapid querying on on sub components \nyeah I I guess just like broadly like \nwith this topic I think that there is a \nreally interesting opportunity for \nVector databases and graph databases to \nbe used together more I think the low \nhanging fruit is you totally separate \nthem entirely and you think of graph \ndatabase more in like the graph \nanalytics kind of way like think about \nlike a Twitter like graph like Conor \nlike Charles's tweet that kind of graph \nwhere you where you then compute like \npage rank kind of centrality metrics for \nlike a particular tweet and then you use \nthat as a feature for re-ranking where \nthat's like one of the tabular features \nfor XG boost \nyeah and like so I think that's the most \nlow-hanging fruit but I I don't know \nlike there's there's another idea to \nlike deep walk no Tibet where you like \nwalk along the graph to find the \npositives and negatives for the \ncontrastive optimization but yeah \ndefinitely I mean there are there is \nsome interesting I want to say it was a \nblog post but at the very least it was \nlike a Twitter thread like Lang chain \nhas has started to incorporate some \ngraph databases and it's starting to \nthink about like craft databases as \ntools like there's uh you know graph \ndatabases have not been as successful as \nmaybe you might have predicted in 2015 \nat the height of nosql and social media \nyou might have been like graph databases \nare gonna are gonna replace SQL and like \nit's the only thing anybody will ever \nuse \num and that's like the opposite has \nhappened like SQL databases have gotten \nbetter at storing graphs and gotten \nbetter at storing uh uh documents and \nother things but um but the at the very \nat the bare minimum representing graph \nstructures inside of databases and using \nthat as part of the querying searching \nranking process very like very clearly a \nton of opportunity there \nyeah yeah so it's so I have so many \ndifferent ways of just conceptualizing \nthis in my head like you could be \ntalking about like a neighborhood of \nhouses something where there's like a \ngraph structure that maybe you embed \ninto a vector or like a molecule where \nyou embed that graph structure into a \nvector or yeah or the graph is itself \nlike something that you derive out to \ncontextualize the vector and yeah \nyeah yeah yeah \nI just think like I don't know there's \nthis one paper I saw that was called \nPrime kg from Harvard biomedical \ninformatics Institute that was like \ndisease drug Target relations and then \neach one has has like unstructured Text \ndata about it that's using and embedding \nand there's like something about \nclassifying sub graphs as well that are \nlike affiliated with some particular \nlike metabolic pathway like there's just \nsomething to this and I and the reason \nI'm trying to connect this back with the \nDiscord bot is I also like to think \nabout like I'm you know I have a \nweeviate podcast transcriptions data set \nthat you'll soon be in Charles and like \nI like to build a graph of this with the \nwegate blogs and the weeviate \ndocumentation and I'm thinking like how \ndo I design this data schema and that's \nkind of what I've settled on now is like \nI just have the chunk master class and \nthen I have links to these kind of you \nknow podcast transcripts blogs like \nseparate they have their own index as \nwell but this master thing is really \nwhere the meat of it is interesting \nbecause it I mean just yeah it's just \npretty I think pretty interesting \nthinking about the data schema with that \nwith like you can use symbolic \nproperties to filter your search through \nit \nuh but it's yeah I don't know it's just \nlike digging into it further yeah yeah \nthere's a yeah there's definitely a lot \nthere and I'm I'm sure yeah the people \ncoming from the ml world have a lot to \nlearn from the people who've been \nthinking about search and retrieval \num with and without uh ml involved at \nall and uh yeah part of what is exciting \nabout this moment of like rapid \niteration and Rapid building of like \nfull stack applications is that now \npeople from all kinds of different \ndisciplines of software are looking at \nthis paying attention to it and being \nlike wait a second I recognize that \npattern that's what we've been doing for \n30 years you're still doing the dumb \nversion of it let me let me give you the \nbenefit of like three decades of \nthinking about this problem here's like \nhere's concentrated nuggets of better \nways to do things \num and so you can see that sort of like \nhappening with um yeah with retrieval \nwith tool use with uh yeah language \nmodels for code generation with uh yeah \nyou with ux and and design with um yeah \nwith uh constructing defensible \nbusinesses and thinking about the like \nthe whole uh the whole business around \nthe features or products you're building \nwith language models you know amazing \nwell Charles I'm so happy with our \ncoverage of the full stack deep learning \nI think we really you know explaining \nkind of the zero shot MVP get started \niterate on the ux instead of the model \nand then this data engine what might be \nthe middleware for realizing that is it \nworth realizing it and all the new I \nthink it was such a great coverage let \nme kind of wrapping up this podcast ask \nyou like a broad question of like some \nof the directions for the future I know \nthis is this question can kind of put \npeople on the spots like what you know \npredict the future but like what is \nmaybe not necessarily something that it \ncould be something that just like you \ncan answer this however you like of \ncourse but like whether it's something \nthat you just want to see happen like \nllm inference costs like nothing \nbasically or it could be you know I \ndon't know just a just like a dream like \njust what you oh sorry or it could be \nsomething that you just think very \npractically this is just the force is \nheaded in this direction so kind of like \nDreaming or practically however you want \nto take the question yeah yeah \num I appreciate the breadth of question \num yeah yeah \nuh I'd say that thinking on let's call \nit like \nyeah on like a one to three year time \nscale the phenomena that I think are \nmost important \nare the decreasing cost of inference \nand the incorporation and \nmultimodality \nand \nand like maybe the longer end of the \nlike three years up to maybe five years \nthe combination of those two things \nunlocking \num applications in robotics hmm \nso cost of inference is going down like \nit's just we are in we're in like a uh \nsuper Moore's Law like with the cost of \ncognitive capabilities like you set some \nyou said some Benchmark of like I want \nto be able to do at least these 10 \nthings with a model \num and then you can just watch that \nplummet the cost just absolutely plummet \nI think the Ada embeddings from openai \nhave gone down by probably 10x since uh \nsince like November \num and uh like \nyeah like with GPT uh three two turbo \nthat was uh our 3.5 to 3.5 turbo like \nthat was a a 10x reduction in cost and \nlike six months or something \num and they're not done \nuh so \nthat is I expect that phenomenon to \ncontinue there's competitive pressure \nthere's Hardware Innovation there's all \nthe work being done to get like things \ndown to in three inference and you know \num and shrink these things down put them \non consumer cards there's just like oh \nand like always the Dark Horse of um of \nlike specialized accelerators \num and like people can just like you \nknow you the architecture's been fixed \nfor long enough though like attention \nhas been on that for long enough people \ncan just like really just keep cranking \nthat number down and \num we have seen \nwhile retaining like the same level of \ncapabilities uh so I would expect the \nlike we're just going to continue to see \nthe cost of inference going down \nobviously we'll continue to push the \nfrontier of capabilities and so the \nfrontier of capabilities might always \ncost like the same amount or might go up \nin cost to get the frontier of \ncapabilities but those capabilities are \nalways they're moving up it's like you \nknow you have to be in the right \nreference frame to think about this and \nso in a future where it is \num like gbd 3.5 turbo capabilities \nare 10x cheaper in a year and then 50x \ncheaper in two years like that's a \ndifferent world than the one we're in \nright now so I've had people ask me like \nwhen am I going to get chat gbt NPCs in \nmy video games and it's like \nnot today unless you're unless you're \nwilling to Shell out like a dollar a \nminute to play a video game but a dollar \na minute \num becomes like a Pentium in it in like \ntwo or three years and that's like very \nvery like people like that unlocks \napplications of these models that are \ncurrently blocked \num I think you know \nmulti-modality is one of those things \nthat we are getting into smaller and \nsmaller models we're getting into higher \nuh higher quality uh and faster \ninference Oakland Flamingo V2 came out \nlike within the last week uh of this \nrecording and that's like an improved \num multimodal model people have been \nfinding better and better ways to do \nimage language multimodality \num and those models as mentioned \num earlier like the gpt4 self-driving \nexample like you unlock a lot of uh uh \ntransfer learning opportunities between \nimage and vision that make the image \nmodels or the vision models uh or sorry \nthe image models or the language models \nboth better \num and so the trend that brings those \ntwo things together that I'm excited \nabout \num on this time Horizon is robotics \num the general discipline in which \nself-driving technically should be put \num where if you can run GPT 3.5 turbo in \nmilliseconds for you know on something \nthat's drawing 10 watts of power \num then you have yourself like a robot \nthat you can talk to to deliver commands \num so long as that language model can \ninterface with the the robot body as \nlike one of its tools \num perhaps via lower level reinforcement \nlearning uh style policies that um \nthat's just like \nwe don't have general purpose robots for \na number of reasons but in a couple of \nyears \num they can't be smart enough and they \naren't as uh easy to interact with when \nthey're doing tasks as humans that \nexcuse is gone \num the servos and the uh what do you do \nwhen when it swings around and breaks \nsomebody's nose uh those kinds of \nquestions of the maintenance uh those \nquestions remain hard \num but not the intelligence \nyeah super compelling picture for the \nfuture I inspired by all those things as \nwell I I think with the maybe one thing \nto stay on I mean I think um this this \nkind of like NPCs in video games with \nsuper cheap L alums one idea that's \nalways stuck with me that I find to be \nreally fascinating is um I had you Shang \nwoo on the podcast who discussed chat \nArena where it's like you know Charles \nand Connor speaking in simulated \nconversations like a million simulated \nconversations between us and like this \nidea of just like creating this like I \nlike to think of it as we take \ngenerative models and we create the \noutput Space by sampling from them and \nthen we use Vector search to look in \nthat uh the latent space of that \ngenerated output space to see like as \nany of these like now is like more to \nsearch through or something like that \ninteresting yeah yeah definitely \nlanguage models are useful for their \nability to allow us to like explore \nlanguage \num like like people people focus a lot \non the like the Practical applications \npeople focus on like oh I can use the \nfact that this generates language and \nrequires language as one of its \nexpensive inputs to like accelerate and \namplify like but those are like \nDownstream of this like fundamental \nthing which is we now have machines that \nare like capable explorers of language \nspace capable producers of utterances \nlike um yeah and that is maybe like very \nlong term uh at the scale of like \ndecades probably a very interesting \nphenomenon about language models how \ndoes it change the way that we speak how \ndoes it change the way that we interact \nwith language that now that um uh the \nproduction and exploration of language \nis no longer bottlenecked on a human \nbeing \num \nproducing \nyeah it was fascinating it yeah I think \nlike there's this thing that one of the \nbig dangers of language models is that \nthey're so persuasive that you like \nsimilar to how a recommendation engine \nnow is already kind of persuasive for \nextreme ideas by like keeping you in \ninterest \nthat the yeah \nyeah the whole exploring the language \nbut I love think about that and then \nalso like when you draw when you draw \nthat to code as well how it can like \nexplore the space of what code can do by \nwriting all sorts of code and you have \nto have abstractions that you share with \nother llm programmers and they're like \nokay I like the subtraction like yeah \nyeah we've barely begun to see what the \nimpact of these things on programming is \ngoing to be right like um yeah changes \nin Technologies produced by programming \num like reflect back and change \nprogramming languages so like the rise \nof developer tooling like really really \nhigh quality developer in editor \ndeveloper tooling is changing the way \npeople think about languages like rust \nwould not be nearly as easy and fun at \nleast in the in the good times to write \num were it not for like the various \nforms like intellisense code completion \nlike the compiler and the analyzer uh \nare like directly interfacing with the \ndoc man like if I had to write it on a \npunch card you know or like write it in \na static document and it also compile \nthere then get back an error message as \nopposed to this is the type I'm \ninferring you get it on Hover like that \nthat has already changed the behavioral \nlanguages python is getting typing over \num its own dead body \nbut uh and that part of that is because \npeople love this developer experience of \nbeing able to like see those things and \npreviously the fact that python didn't \nhave types was like its selling point \num and and that's just that's that's \njust a very humdrum technological \nchanges around like the like language \nserver protocol and um and like \nimprovements in um in in developer \nenvironments and text editors so to \nimagine yeah what's possible now that \nproduction semantically meaningful text \nis not bottlenecked on humans \num I think we'll see some pretty rad \nprogramming languages in like a 10 to 20 \nyear timeline \nyeah Miss and that's a funny like I also \nlike came into python like I remember \nthe JavaScript like you don't have to \nwrite the types I'm like oh nice like \ntypescript it's like oh no it's back \nyeah \nbut yeah Charles thank you so much for \njoining the weba podcast this is truly \none of my favorite podcasts we covered \nso many topics and I learned so much \nthank you so much yeah thanks so much \nfor having me Connor this was a this is \na blast \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Charles Frye on Full Stack Deep Learning - Weaviate Podcast #57!", "path": "",
