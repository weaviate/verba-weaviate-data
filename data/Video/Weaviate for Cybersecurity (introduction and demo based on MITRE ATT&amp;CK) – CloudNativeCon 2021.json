{"text": "Video presentation by Bob van Luijt showing the Weaviate vector search engine during CloudNativeCon 2021. In this video, you ... \nhello everybody thank you for watching \nthis video \ni'm going to talk about uh the viviate \nvector search engine \nand then specifically from the \nperspective of \nthreat analysis in cyber security \non mostly we're gonna focusing on i'm \ngonna \ntell a little bit about what we've hit \nis and then we're gonna focus on the \ndemo \num and i'm also gonna show give you some \npointers how you can start working with \nit yourself \nso we've hit is a vector search engine \nand \nit's a it's a full crowd support \ndatabase but the most important thing to \nbear in mind is that the \nthe difference between traditional \nsearch engines \nand vector search engines like wev8 is \nthat we've yet \nfocuses on the vector representation of \nthe data \nthat is stored within it and those \nfactory presentations are given to it \nbased on machine learning models \nand the simplest way to show you the \ndifference between a traditional search \nengine and a vector search engine \nis the following so let's look at this \ndata object \nso we have here data object representing \na in this case \ncybersecurity threat group so we have \nhere fin6 \nand then you see like a group that has \nfocused on an attacking point of sales \ndevices \nwell if he would store this data object \nin a traditional search engine and we \nwant to retrieve it \nand now we say for example we are \nlooking for something related to \nfine as hardware attacks then it will \nnot find anything because we know that \nfin6 is related to these \nthis query but well the \nthe exact keywords are not matched in \nthis \ndata object however when you do this in \na vector search engine like we've yet \nit will actually return fin6 because it \nknow that there's a relation between \nfinance hardware and attack based on \na group that focuses on attacking point \nof sales devices \nand that is the most important added \nvalue of these \nvector search engines like we've yet and \nas you will see in the demo a lot of new \nuse cases come from this \nso when it comes to the cyber security \ndomain our main focus \nor our main question that we want to \nanswer is like can we go from like a \nrule-based approach to a \nprediction-based approach \nand then of course we want to do that \nbased on your own data \nso again with this database and in the \nand and of the type of a search engine \nso that means that you can use \nany data um to store in vva so it can \nalso be your own data \nthat can be a proprietary data and that \ndoesn't really matter \nand then of course we focus on um \nenabling you to have an in \nan easy and fast and secure way \nto to work with that data as you will \nsee in the demo as well \nso quickly to a definition of we've jet \nso we've had this cloud native \nwhat we mean with that is that uh \nif you have kubernetes or more on a \nlocal instance if you have docker \ncompose you can you can work with \nwith we've yet it's modular and \nand that's one of our and what makes \nunique \nwith it unique is its modular nature so \nthe vv8 core \num is a pure vector database where you \ncan store data objects \nand their factory presentations but we \nhave a whole set of modules around we \nevade \nlike nlp models question answering model \nmodules vectorization modules etc etc \nand during the demo i'm going to show \nwith you with two modules \nthe factorization module \nand the question answering module we \nfocus with vv8 on being \nas real time as possible so we're \nconstantly working on improving \nwe've gate and the speed of the \nalgorithms to to do the vector \nretrievals \nit's a vector search engine so what \nmakes difference from traditional search \nengines \nis that rather than doing keyword \nmatching \nwe focus on vector matching \nand it's built to skill your machine \nlearning models \nwhy what do we mean with this well what \nwe mean with this \nis that having machinery modules is one \nthing \noh sorry models is one thing but also \nusing them in an efficient way and \nscaling them to production sizes \nthat's and completely different question \nso um a little bit about the core \nfeatures so with that \ntwo core features the first one is \nsearch or as we like to say search and \ndiscovery \nin your data so the demo that i'm gonna \nshow you is completely \nfocusing on search and how to find \nthings using we've yet \nbut on the other hand we also have \nclassification and the easiest way to \nthink of classification is context is \nthat we've yet can automatically make \nrelations in your data sets \nso where search there is some form of \nhuman or \nmachine input to get to insights with \nclassification you can ask we've yet to \ndo that automatically \nthen we have some other well unique \nfeatures from \neva's so first the modules as i just \ndescribed \num we have a bunch of them if you have \nideas for modules we're more than \num happy to hear um \nyou know how you think we can improve \nvva's module ecosystem \nby the way you can also create your own \nmodules \nthen we support any media type so we've \nhad \nnot only the vector representations that \nwe've yet can store \nbut also the data objects can be of any \nmedia type \nso within one single vp8 you can store \ntextual text objects and text effect \nvectors to represent these data objects \nbut also for example images or video \nagree we've hit itself has a graph like \na data model so what you will see when \ni show the demo to you we use graphql \ngraphql is used to um not only do the \nmachine learning matching but also to \nmake traditional graph relations \nand most importantly to mix and match \nthem \nand then of course we focus on we being \nscalable and \nfast and we're constantly updating and \nimproving we've hit so with every \nrelease we get a bit more a bit more \nfaster and a bit more scalable \nso when it comes to the um the vertical \nof cyber security \nwe mostly focus on intelligent threat \nanalysis \nmeaning that we we've yet focuses on \nstructured data \nso that can be descriptions text \ndocuments or those kind of things \nthat are related to a threat analysis \nso for this demo we're using the metra \ntech \nframework for the simple reason that it \ncontains a lot of graph relations but \nalso a lot of unstructured data \nwe use a vva transformers module \nwhich is fine to fine-tune with cyber \nsecurity data \nin this case we use sentence birth and \nthat brings me \nto the demo so before i show you the \ndemo i quickly want to show the \ndocumentation so if we just \nuh simply search for vpa documentation \nyou find it on our website \nsemi.technology \non the left hand side you find a lot of \ninformation with a lot of kind of \nfeatures \nalso the the index plugins and the \nmodules what i would like to recommend \nis that if you go to installation you \nfind the customize your wev8 setup link \nwhere you can very easily go to the \nconfigurator to configure \nyour own weavie8 instance \nif you want to query we've yet we have \ngraphql interfaces \nso for example get where you see \nexamples in graphql python javascript go \netc \nand even in curl um and you can also try \nout the test \ndata set there so when we are in the \nwe've hit console \num we get an interface where we can use \ngraphql to query through vp8 \nand the um setup how ev88 works is \nactually very simple so \num with it has three core functions \nmeaning that's aggregate that is \nexplore and that is get \nand aggregate is used to \nwell get an as an aggregate function so \nfor example how many objects \nare stored in vvate explore issues to \nsearch for the complete vector space \nbut get is used to make a mix of \nvector searches and graph searches and \nthat's what we're going to use for the \ndemo \ninside we've ate you have a \n[Music] \ngraph like data model so that means that \nyou can create \nany class and any property so in this \ncase our class and property structure is \nbased on the meteor attack framework \nso let's take a look at the first one so \nlet's take a look at \nthreat groups so thread groups have a \nname \nand this very simple query says like get \nme thread groups and show them \nshow me their names so running this \nquery you see a bunch of \nthread groups they're not organized in \nany way they're just randomly shown \nbased on this query um we can also go \nat properties so we can say for example \nsay like a show the description \nand there you see for example copy \nkittens you see the the description \nof the the thread group so let's go one \nstep back \nnow what we now can do is that we can \nenable the \nmachine learning model and in this we've \nhad instance we have two modules \nenabled the factorization module and the \nq a module so let's start by looking at \nthe from the perspective \nof the q a module so what we can do is \nthat we can say well we want to ask a \nquestion \nthen of course we have the question and \nthe question that we want to ask is \nwho targeted \nthe government in the \nmiddle east make an array that's \nincorrect should like \ndo it like this we can se the properties \nthat we want to search through and that \nis something we want to do based on the \nuh descriptions and then we have \nso-called \nunderscore properties additional \nor you can say well this is where we \nwant to see the answer to the question \nand we want to see the result so very \nsimple question a query where we say \nbased on these thread groups search for \nthe descriptions \nand show us who targeted the government \nin the middle east so let's run this \nquery \nso here we'll find the answer oral rig \nwhat we now can do with \nwe've gate is that we can select well \nfor example \nalso include the name of this threat the \ndescription of this threat group \nand then you see that the name is \nactually also oil rig \nbut if you're also going to look at the \ndescription \nthen we see that actually inside the \ndescription there's more information \nabout oil rig and one of the things that \ni want to show you is that we can even \ndrill down in the descriptions \nbecause we can say like um \nwe can alternate alter the question to \nask for example \nunder what name was \nrig also known \nlike this so let me remove the \ndescription temporarily \nso if i now run this query then we see \nthat in the in the document about all \nrig we leave \nwe we learn that act 34 is also \na way how allrec is called \nso let's go one step deeper so let's say \nlike uh \nwhat kind of attacks does \npaul rick use \nthis query and we find that in the \ndocument white ulric \nthe answer is found which is supply \nchain attacks \num we've now been looking at the graph \nfrom the level of the \nthreat group so let's take a completely \ndifferent \napproach and use the supply chain \neffects in there \nso let's start from the perspective of \nthe attack \ntechnique and so if you now also say \ni have this simple query say where we \nsay get attack techniques and show me \nthe names and if we run this query \nwe just get a bunch of attack techniques \ncoming from the mitra attack framework \nnow when we get we can do question \nanswering but we can also do \na near searches so we can also \nsearch for neighboring concepts so let's \nsay for example here we have near \ntext and we're going to look for \nconcepts and then for the concepts \nlet's look at the supply chain attacks \nand let's say for this query limited to \nthe first \n10 results so if i now run these queries \nthen with supply chain attacks then the \nmost neighboring concepts are of course \nwell the supply chain compromise \nthe supply chain compromise or the \ncompromising hardware supply chain etc \nnow the question is like how does wev88 \nknow what to show what is the \ncertainty that we've hit has in showing \nthese results \nwell to to get some feedback there \nwe can actually ask we've ea to show us \nthe certainty \nso if you run this query then we see the \ncertainty \nbased on which we've yet organized the \nresults \nand the certainty is related to the \ndistance \nfrom the query to the data object \nso that's why we've it says like okay \nsupply chain compromises to come first \nfor supply chain attacks \netc so what we see here as well \nthat if we dive under eighty percent of \ncertainty \nwe kinda lose a lot more and more \ncontext \nbased on the query that we have so \ninstead of limiting \nthis query we can actually say well we \nwanna be \nat least eighty percent certain based on \nthe results that we've heard is showing \nbased on supply chain attacks now of \ncourse this shows just \nsingle classes and single nodes in the \nresults \nbut let's say that if we talk about \nsupply chain attacks \num how can we actually mitigate these \ndetects and here \nwe can make actually a graph relation so \nwe can say \noh not known a text but no mitigations \nso we can say on mitigation show the \nname of the medication \nand let's remove the certainty so \nrunning this query says that for supply \nchain compromise \nyou you you have you can update software \nor you can do vulnerability a \nvulnerability scanning and \nwhen it comes to a comprising hardware \nsupply chain \nyou can do a boot integrity so this is a \nsimple example how you see we can mix \nthe machinery model searching \nand the traditional graph relations \nbut we can also go one step further so \nfor example what do we need to do \num if something happened in our in our \ndata landscape \nand or in a software landscape and we \nwouldn't solve that problem \nso just let's be very uh descriptive and \nlet's ask \na um a solution to a simple set of \nconcepts that we're going to ask from \nbv8 \nthat somehow should be hidden in the \nmeter in metres attack framework \nso a port was opened \nat the hosts \nfirewall so same query but we're now \ngoing to say well \ninside the the attack they somehow \nopened they \nopened a port at the hostess firewall \nwe want to be at least 80 certain and we \nwant immediately so \nshown what the known mitigations are for \nthese solutions \nand we want to see names for these types \nof attacks \nso what we see here is that opening a \nport on the host's firewall is known as \ntraffic signaling or port knocking \nand we see that the known mitigation is \nalways to filter the network traffic we \ncan \neven go a step further so if we say well \nso what is it actually that we need to \ndo then we can also ask for the \ndescription of this mitigation \nand then you see that the twice shows \nthe same \nmitigation so we know what we need to do \nto solve this problem so that is the \nbasic demo \nfrom the meteor attack framework within \nweave yet there are a few more things \nthat i want to share with you before i \nend this presentation \nonce is that i want to re-emphasize that \nwe've hate runs like a normal database \non-prem or in private cloud or in the \nprivate public cloud or \neven in the public cloud \nwe have custom security nlp models \nwe have a custom review module that \ndeals with the cyber security models \nthemselves \nviviet comes with direct api integration \nso as you have seen \nfrom the demo and from the documentation \nwe have a set of client libraries which \nwe are constantly updating and improving \nand then you also have the graph \nrepresentations of frameworks like for \nexample the metra deck framework i would \nlike to emphasize that mitra was in this \ndemo just an example \nyou can use any structure any framework \nor \nany schema that you would like to use \nwithin wev8 \nfor your needs so thank you very much \nfor listening my name is bob fallout \nfeel free to reach out to me and bob at \nsamada technology if you want to learn \nmore about how vp8 can help \nin your domain or with your \nthe challenges that you have on \nsemi.technology you can also find our \nopen course software so you can play \naround with it you can try it out \nso i'm looking very much forward to \nhearing from you and hopefully we can \nhelp you \ntaking the next step in intelligent \nthreat analysis \nthank you so much for listening bye \n", "type": "Video", "name":
