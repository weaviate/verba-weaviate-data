{"text": "Video presentation by Bob van Luijt showing the Weaviate vector search engine during CloudNativeCon 2021. In this video, you ... \nhello everybody thank you for watchingthis videoi'm going to talk about uh the viviatevector search engineand then specifically from theperspective ofthreat analysis in cyber securityon mostly we're gonna focusing on i'mgonnatell a little bit about what we've hitis and then we're gonna focus on thedemoum and i'm also gonna show give you somepointers how you can start working withit yourselfso we've hit is a vector search engineandit's a it's a full crowd supportdatabase but the most important thing tobear in mind is that thethe difference between traditionalsearch enginesand vector search engines like wev8 isthat we've yetfocuses on the vector representation ofthe datathat is stored within it and thosefactory presentations are given to itbased on machine learning modelsand the simplest way to show you thedifference between a traditional searchengine and a vector search engineis the following so let's look at thisdata objectso we have here data object representinga in this casecybersecurity threat group so we havehere fin6and then you see like a group that hasfocused on an attacking point of salesdeviceswell if he would store this data objectin a traditional search engine and wewant to retrieve itand now we say for example we arelooking for something related tofine as hardware attacks then it willnot find anything because we know thatfin6 is related to thesethis query but well thethe exact keywords are not matched inthisdata object however when you do this ina vector search engine like we've yetit will actually return fin6 because itknow that there's a relation betweenfinance hardware and attack based ona group that focuses on attacking pointof sales devicesand that is the most important addedvalue of thesevector search engines like we've yet andas you will see in the demo a lot of newuse cases come from thisso when it comes to the cyber securitydomain our main focusor our main question that we want toanswer is like can we go from like arule-based approach to aprediction-based approachand then of course we want to do thatbased on your own dataso again with this database and in theand and of the type of a search engineso that means that you can useany data um to store in vva so it canalso be your own datathat can be a proprietary data and thatdoesn't really matterand then of course we focus on umenabling you to have an inan easy and fast and secure wayto to work with that data as you willsee in the demo as wellso quickly to a definition of we've jetso we've had this cloud nativewhat we mean with that is that uhif you have kubernetes or more on alocal instance if you have dockercompose you can you can work withwith we've yet it's modular andand that's one of our and what makesuniquewith it unique is its modular nature sothe vv8 coreum is a pure vector database where youcan store data objectsand their factory presentations but wehave a whole set of modules around weevadelike nlp models question answering modelmodules vectorization modules etc etcand during the demo i'm going to showwith you with two modulesthe factorization moduleand the question answering module wefocus with vv8 on beingas real time as possible so we'reconstantly working on improvingwe've gate and the speed of thealgorithms to to do the vectorretrievalsit's a vector search engine so whatmakes difference from traditional searchenginesis that rather than doing keywordmatchingwe focus on vector matchingand it's built to skill your machinelearning modelswhy what do we mean with this well whatwe mean with thisis that having machinery modules is onethingoh sorry models is one thing but alsousing them in an efficient way andscaling them to production sizesthat's and completely different questionso um a little bit about the corefeatures so with thattwo core features the first one issearch or as we like to say search anddiscoveryin your data so the demo that i'm gonnashow you is completelyfocusing on search and how to findthings using we've yetbut on the other hand we also haveclassification and the easiest way tothink of classification is context isthat we've yet can automatically makerelations in your data setsso where search there is some form ofhuman ormachine input to get to insights withclassification you can ask we've yet todo that automaticallythen we have some other well uniquefeatures fromeva's so first the modules as i justdescribedum we have a bunch of them if you haveideas for modules we're more thanum happy to hear umyou know how you think we can improvevva's module ecosystemby the way you can also create your ownmodulesthen we support any media type so we'vehadnot only the vector representations thatwe've yet can storebut also the data objects can be of anymedia typeso within one single vp8 you can storetextual text objects and text effectvectors to represent these data objectsbut also for example images or videoagree we've hit itself has a graph likea data model so what you will see wheni show the demo to you we use graphqlgraphql is used to um not only do themachine learning matching but also tomake traditional graph relationsand most importantly to mix and matchthemand then of course we focus on we beingscalable andfast and we're constantly updating andimproving we've hit so with everyrelease we get a bit more a bit morefaster and a bit more scalableso when it comes to the um the verticalof cyber securitywe mostly focus on intelligent threatanalysismeaning that we we've yet focuses onstructured dataso that can be descriptions textdocuments or those kind of thingsthat are related to a threat analysisso for this demo we're using the metratechframework for the simple reason that itcontains a lot of graph relations butalso a lot of unstructured datawe use a vva transformers modulewhich is fine to fine-tune with cybersecurity datain this case we use sentence birth andthat brings meto the demo so before i show you thedemo i quickly want to show thedocumentation so if we justuh simply search for vpa documentationyou find it on our websitesemi.technologyon the left hand side you find a lot ofinformation with a lot of kind offeaturesalso the the index plugins and themodules what i would like to recommendis that if you go to installation youfind the customize your wev8 setup linkwhere you can very easily go to theconfigurator to configureyour own weavie8 instanceif you want to query we've yet we havegraphql interfacesso for example get where you seeexamples in graphql python javascript goetcand even in curl um and you can also tryout the testdata set there so when we are in thewe've hit consoleum we get an interface where we can usegraphql to query through vp8and the um setup how ev88 works isactually very simple soum with it has three core functionsmeaning that's aggregate that isexplore and that is getand aggregate is used towell get an as an aggregate function sofor example how many objectsare stored in vvate explore issues tosearch for the complete vector spacebut get is used to make a mix ofvector searches and graph searches andthat's what we're going to use for thedemoinside we've ate you have a[Music]graph like data model so that means thatyou can createany class and any property so in thiscase our class and property structure isbased on the meteor attack frameworkso let's take a look at the first one solet's take a look atthreat groups so thread groups have anameand this very simple query says like getme thread groups and show themshow me their names so running thisquery you see a bunch ofthread groups they're not organized inany way they're just randomly shownbased on this query um we can also goat properties so we can say for examplesay like a show the descriptionand there you see for example copykittens you see the the descriptionof the the thread group so let's go onestep backnow what we now can do is that we canenable themachine learning model and in this we'vehad instance we have two modulesenabled the factorization module and theq a module so let's start by looking atthe from the perspectiveof the q a module so what we can do isthat we can say well we want to ask aquestionthen of course we have the question andthe question that we want to ask iswho targetedthe government in themiddle east make an array that'sincorrect should likedo it like this we can se the propertiesthat we want to search through and thatis something we want to do based on theuh descriptions and then we haveso-calledunderscore properties additionalor you can say well this is where wewant to see the answer to the questionand we want to see the result so verysimple question a query where we saybased on these thread groups search forthe descriptionsand show us who targeted the governmentin the middle east so let's run thisqueryso here we'll find the answer oral rigwhat we now can do withwe've gate is that we can select wellfor examplealso include the name of this threat thedescription of this threat groupand then you see that the name isactually also oil rigbut if you're also going to look at thedescriptionthen we see that actually inside thedescription there's more informationabout oil rig and one of the things thati want to show you is that we can evendrill down in the descriptionsbecause we can say like umwe can alternate alter the question toask for exampleunder what name wasrig also knownlike this so let me remove thedescription temporarilyso if i now run this query then we seethat in the in the document about allrig we leavewe we learn that act 34 is alsoa way how allrec is calledso let's go one step deeper so let's saylike uhwhat kind of attacks doespaul rick usethis query and we find that in thedocument white ulricthe answer is found which is supplychain attacksum we've now been looking at the graphfrom the level of thethreat group so let's take a completelydifferentapproach and use the supply chaineffects in thereso let's start from the perspective ofthe attacktechnique and so if you now also sayi have this simple query say where wesay get attack techniques and show methe names and if we run this querywe just get a bunch of attack techniquescoming from the mitra attack frameworknow when we get we can do questionanswering but we can also doa near searches so we can alsosearch for neighboring concepts so let'ssay for example here we have neartext and we're going to look forconcepts and then for the conceptslet's look at the supply chain attacksand let's say for this query limited tothe first10 results so if i now run these queriesthen with supply chain attacks then themost neighboring concepts are of coursewell the supply chain compromisethe supply chain compromise or thecompromising hardware supply chain etcnow the question is like how does wev88know what to show what is thecertainty that we've hit has in showingthese resultswell to to get some feedback therewe can actually ask we've ea to show usthe certaintyso if you run this query then we see thecertaintybased on which we've yet organized theresultsand the certainty is related to thedistancefrom the query to the data objectso that's why we've it says like okaysupply chain compromises to come firstfor supply chain attacksetc so what we see here as wellthat if we dive under eighty percent ofcertaintywe kinda lose a lot more and morecontextbased on the query that we have soinstead of limitingthis query we can actually say well wewanna beat least eighty percent certain based onthe results that we've heard is showingbased on supply chain attacks now ofcourse this shows justsingle classes and single nodes in theresultsbut let's say that if we talk aboutsupply chain attacksum how can we actually mitigate thesedetects and herewe can make actually a graph relation sowe can sayoh not known a text but no mitigationsso we can say on mitigation show thename of the medicationand let's remove the certainty sorunning this query says that for supplychain compromiseyou you you have you can update softwareor you can do vulnerability avulnerability scanning andwhen it comes to a comprising hardwaresupply chainyou can do a boot integrity so this is asimple example how you see we can mixthe machinery model searchingand the traditional graph relationsbut we can also go one step further sofor example what do we need to doum if something happened in our in ourdata landscapeand or in a software landscape and wewouldn't solve that problemso just let's be very uh descriptive andlet's aska um a solution to a simple set ofconcepts that we're going to ask frombv8that somehow should be hidden in themeter in metres attack frameworkso a port was openedat the hostsfirewall so same query but we're nowgoing to say wellinside the the attack they somehowopened theyopened a port at the hostess firewallwe want to be at least 80 certain and wewant immediately soshown what the known mitigations are forthese solutionsand we want to see names for these typesof attacksso what we see here is that opening aport on the host's firewall is known astraffic signaling or port knockingand we see that the known mitigation isalways to filter the network traffic wecaneven go a step further so if we say wellso what is it actually that we need todo then we can also ask for thedescription of this mitigationand then you see that the twice showsthe samemitigation so we know what we need to doto solve this problem so that is thebasic demofrom the meteor attack framework withinweave yet there are a few more thingsthat i want to share with you before iend this presentationonce is that i want to re-emphasize thatwe've hate runs like a normal databaseon-prem or in private cloud or in theprivate public cloud oreven in the public cloudwe have custom security nlp modelswe have a custom review module thatdeals with the cyber security modelsthemselvesviviet comes with direct api integrationso as you have seenfrom the demo and from the documentationwe have a set of client libraries whichwe are constantly updating and improvingand then you also have the graphrepresentations of frameworks like forexample the metra deck framework i wouldlike to emphasize that mitra was in thisdemo just an exampleyou can use any structure any frameworkorany schema that you would like to usewithin wev8for your needs so thank you very muchfor listening my name is bob falloutfeel free to reach out to me and bob atsamada technology if you want to learnmore about how vp8 can helpin your domain or with yourthe challenges that you have onsemi.technology you can also find ouropen course software so you can playaround with it you can try it outso i'm looking very much forward tohearing from you and hopefully we canhelp youtaking the next step in intelligentthreat analysisthank you so much for listening bye", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate for Cybersecurity (introduction and demo based on MITRE ATT&amp;CK) \u2013
