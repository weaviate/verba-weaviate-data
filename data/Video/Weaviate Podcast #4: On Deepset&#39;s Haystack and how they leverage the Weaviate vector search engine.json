{"text": "NLP frameworks like Deepset's Haystack are powerful tools to help data scientists and software engineers work with the latest and ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nchecking out the fourth episode of the \nwe va podcast today i'm joined with \nmalte peach the cto of deep set ai which \nhas created the haystack vector search \nengine today we're going to talk about \nall sorts of topics related to vector \nsearch engine the haystack library and \nthe different things that they've built \nand all sorts of cool exciting things \naround these ideas in neural search so \nto get started uh malte could you tell \nus about your \nuh mission of haystack and sort of your \nvision and understanding of vector \nneural search engines yeah sure \num so um basically obviously my personal \nbackground is pretty much described with \nmachine learning engineering and um \nyeah there was probably one \nkey moment \nin my life that made me up ending ending \nup in nlp \nand i was when i did some research in us \nback on like healthcare data back then \num some numerical values some like um \nblood measurements time series data all \nof that we built like a fancy model uh \npredicted some um some some nice things \nin the end doctors told us uh yeah \nthat's that's not new uh we knew that uh \nit's correct what you predicted but they \nare not super exciting uh and then it \nturned out the only like or they would \nsay the most exciting part uh that they \nwere curious about was \nsome part where we \nmodeled or used data textual data coming \nfrom handwritten notes of doctors \nand from modelling perspective that was \nvery naive modelling i would say but in \nthe end it was the biggest value and um \nthat's i would say how i ended up in nlp \nand also why we \nfound a deep set in 2018 uh because we \nreally saw and believed hey like there's \nso much text data out there in basically \nevery company but it's in most cases not \nreally used there's like it's a \nlot of gold out there but not really \nleveraged \nand in uh 2018 we thought okay yeah \nthey're \ntooling was well okay but like the \nmodels were quite primitive \nbut we really believed hey there must be \nlike there must be something happening \nin the next years there will be \ninnovation there will be something \nsimilar to like imagenet on on computer \nvision there will be this wave of new \nnlp models that that make this text data \navailable \nand that's basically we started deep set \nand \nworked with many industry clients \nthen bert came out there was quite like \ni would say this \nimagenet moment \nand then things accelerated a lot \num and yeah what we what we saw from \nworking with all these industry \ncustomers um was basically that \nit's always \nevery company that we worked with had \nthis issue of accessing \ninformation from this these text amounts \nthese documents and finding it and \nextracting it and \nthat's basically where \nhow we started haystack \nwith the belief okay let's build a \nframework that \nleverages latest research \nand bridges this gap to production in \nthe industry to make it simple to adopt \nthese latest research methods and really \nuse them in that same production and all \nlet's say around this this case of uh \nnew research if you want to say so uh we \nusually say like about finding the \ninformation and also extracting it so \nnot only this \nclassical search uh setting where you \ntype something in you get your results \nthat could be also that you extract \ncertain \nentities or certain um certain \ninformation and kick off other processes \nor so on \num \nyeah so that's basically how we started \nhaystack and uh got uh \ngot pretty well adopted faster than we \nthought uh yeah we have no contributors \nfrom from all around the world from \nnetflix \nmany other companies \nuse it in production and um yeah what we \nwhat we \nhear basically as feedback is um and \nalso use it as a \nstrong philosophy of us \num that the framework is really a lego \nlego \nbox building blocks that you can stick \nflexibly together to some pipelines and \nthen you move that oil production you \ncan exchange one of these pieces easily \nif a new model comes out so i would say \nthat's \nthat's pretty much \nsomething i just want dna and in the dna \nof this whole chain \nand yeah for me i'd say like my vector \nsearch imagenet moment was when i first \ncame across the \nco-search system from salesforce \nresearch and this idea of the pipelines \nis the first time i really saw this \ndiagram where you look at the document \nindex the retrieval pipelines going into \ndifferent downstream applications like \nsummarization question answering or say \na chatbot and this kind of idea of \nhaving these flowing systems for me \nco-search was my \nimagenet realization when i first became \nreally excited about these kinds of \nsystems so i'm really impressed as i was \nlooking through the haystack \nhow to use it and the different \ncomponents of it i really love the \npipelines and so before we get into sort \nof the details of the kind of like the \nlibrary design i want to ask about more \nof your opinions on retrieval \naugmentation and kind of like retrieval \ntransformers and it's obviously very \npopular now with things like deep minds \nretro and open ai's web gpt this really \nexciting idea of retrieval augmented \ntransformers and before i give you a \nchance to talk i want to kind of quickly \npitch this idea \nof do you think that maybe the shape of \nsay \nagi or like a powerful ai the next \ngeneration of that will be that you have \nsuch a powerful reasoning model that all \nyou have to do is just plug in your data \nand then it can just retrieve it and \nthen this reasoning model will be able \nto adapt to any kind of data that you \nretrieve \nsuch that the retrieval augmented \npipeline is so strong that you don't \nreally need as much fine tuning and then \nfrom there we can talk about the farm \nlibrary and haystack and all sorts of \nthings is debate around retrieval \naugmentation and then the need for \nfine-tuning um yeah so i i definitely \nsee that retrieval augmented pipelines \nor models are like a \nsuper important piece towards maybe aji \nat some point \nand um and i mean i think you can take \nit from two sides or two perspectives uh \none let's say just coming from plane \ntransformer models and if you talk about \nsomething like question answering \nretrieval is just basically the way to \nspeed things up right and to make it \nscale to millions of documents having \nlike some kind of filter before and uh \nand really just seeing it that way um \nand that's how we i think initially kind \nof started it um \nthen i think with the um say the rise of \nall these gigantic language models and \nmore like generative approaches um it's \nreally i think now about these two \nschools to say mindsets to beliefs what \nwhere what is today actually helpful and \nwhat where will end up in the future \num \ni'm pretty sure that for today and the \nnext years um \ni would place my bet on retrieval \naugmented pipelines um mainly for two \nreasons um one is \nbasically interpretation \nso um if you \nlet's say have something like \na gpg3 or like a from omai one of the \nmodels um and you ask the query a \nquestion \nand it gives you the answer \nuh it's super hard to understand if \nthat's correct or not now you don't know \nhow it was generated what kind of \ninformation is it based on and that's a \nvery powerful thing with the with \nretrieval and extractive methods right \nthat you \nour users often it's they get these \nresults but then they often also where \nwas that written like give me the exact \npassage and \nwhat what real data is that based on and \nthat's very easily possible \nthe second thing \nyou already mentioned like \nfine tuning or the way to adapt it to \nnew data sets \nif i have something like gpd3 or another \ngenerative model \num \nusually trained on a big \npublic corpus from the internet if \nthat's your domain perfect \nbut \nour customers are mainly like enterprise \nclients \nmaybe from aerospace domain from some \nlegal domain from finance \nsome very deep tech stuff \nand there are usually like \nwords \nand meanings that are \nvery different to general internet \nwikipedia corpus \nand \nyeah i mean this this big models are not \ntrained on it so they don't work \nand they get outdated very easily right \nif \nyou ask one of the not saying our \none-year-old models about \nomicron or kovit or whatever \nthey will won't know and it's very hard \nto to update \nwhy with retrieval it's just hey index \non your document today and out of the \nbox my my model \nknows or can find this information \num so i think these are two powerful \nadvantages \num still like retrievers dance \nretrievers for example there there is i \nthink some um many cases need for fine \ntuning and also like get a lot of boost \nif you fine-tune for your domain \num but it's then usually some something \nyou do once and you can still like \ningest new data and you're fine and you \ndon't need to retrain like every i don't \nknow second day yeah i love those two \narguments for the benefits of retrieval \nthe interpretation of seeing what it's \nreturned and then the ability to adapt \nto new data sets and uh changing \ninformation and i think those are two \nhuge selling points and so kind of to \ndig a little deeper into the fine-tuning \npart i want to ask a little more about \nwhat do you perceive as being more \nvaluable for most use cases fine-tuning \nthe vectorizer so say fine-tuning the \ndense passage retrieval step the the \nsiamese bird or whatever you're using to \nencode the data or fine-tuning the \nreader or the reason or say it and that \nkind of thing and \nsay not only just fine-tuning it on your \ndata set but fine-tuning it to uh to be \nprocessing the retrieved context so so \nwhen you're fine-tuning the question \nanswering model have it be fine-tuned to \nthe retriever component of it so it's \nused to seeing that additional context \nand then that's very in that specific \nkind of retrieve context from the \nend-to-end system um very good question \ni'd say it really depends on the domain \nand use case and the data set um so \ni look a bit back at our customers \nin \nmany cases i think we \nwe get a big boost when fine-tuning the \nthe reader part as well \nespecially if it's like very \nspecific domains very specific questions \num \nand the style is important about the \nanswer as well right sometimes it's not \nthese days not only about \nfactual questions anymore like asking i \nknow where was isn't that founded or \nwhich here \nbut it's really more \nopen questions uh interpretory questions \nlike i don't know what's the what's the \nstrategy of this competitor in china and \nthere you can really get uh get good \nperformance if a few labels doesn't \nrequire much fine tuning but the bit \nhelps a lot um \nand um i think on the receiver side like \nvectorizer um it's it's still helpful \num if um your data set is very large \nand um \nif um also like combinations of \nretrievers don't work out for you so \nwhat we \nsometimes do is combining a sparse \nretrieval with dense retriever and if \nyou kind of hit a barrier there \num then then of course fine-tuning uh \npunching your achiever also \ncan be an option now \nand \ni think that \nthis is a \nas i said like this as this depends it's \nvery important that you have the tooling \nto find out right that if you build a \npipeline um that you have a way to \neasily analyze like what is my \nbottleneck is it the retriever that \ndrops performance or is it the reader or \nany other component that i have \nafterwards \nand that was also i think one one of the \nmotivations back then to to introduce \nthese flexible pipelines in haystack and \nrecently we refactored the whole \nevaluation part so you can get reports \nokay that's performance of of retriever \nnode of the reader node and you really \nsee \nwhat what is worth improving and fine \ntuning super cool and um so i'm really \ncurious about this uh farm library that \nyou've built out for uh fine tuning and \nthe different components that go into it \nwe'd imagine that uh fine tuning any \nkind of deep learning model you'd want \nto do things like maybe have these \nadapter layers like the compactor \nadapter these kind of things so that you \ndon't have to fine-tune 100 of the \nparameters of the pre-trained model uh \nmaybe things like a hyper parameter \noptimization with like a hyperband kind \nof \nthese kind of libraries for that kind of \nsearch \nthings like you know sparsity and then \nand then more so just like standard \ntools for training deep learning models \nlike mixed precision and i saw gradient \naccumulation in farm these kinds of \nthings that generally uh facilitate \ntraining any deep learning any large \ndeep learning model so what kind of \nthings are \nspecific to farm and specific to \nfine-tuning the reader models with the \nuh like with the retrieval appendage as \na part of the pipeline \num so farm was basically our i think the \nfirst open source project that we \npublished back then and kind of haystack \ncame afterwards and actually now \nmigrated quite some some parts from farm \nuh \nto haystack so we have it really like \nall integrated so um basically all of \nthe modeling related retrievers to \nreaders \nis now happening in in haystack um but \nstill farmers \nfrom a \ndesign perspective \nquite interesting the core idea back \nthen was that we really have one \nsay language model as a component and \nthen multiple prediction heads that you \ncan stick up the stick upon \nthis language model and um this is \nsomething we for example now think a bit \nabout for for some question answering \ntasks um \nmight be helpful to have one prediction \nhead that for example um gives you the \num the span answer \nbut another one that for example can can \nclassify this answer or can give you \num just binary like yes no like if this \nis the span that i found and there's \nlike a yeah it's like a yes uh answer or \nno answer um \nand uh all what you mentioned to um \nfine tuning \ntooling that is out there um is i think \nthere's like a lot of potential and we \nuh we just implemented um a distillation \napproach \ninstallation is to \nthere's a lot of methods out there but i \nthink there's still um a lot of \npotential to to improve and uh \nand um has a huge benefit for um for \nindustry and production um tiny bird is \nserving a nice nice idea and example \num so it's i think it's one degree about \nthe modeling part distilling maybe from \na larger model the knowledge to \nsomething smaller um but also combining \nthis idea with something like data set \naugmentation so \neverything that \nhelps me as a developer in industry to \nto fine tune a \nmodel with less data that's that's uh \nthat's super nice um \nand ideally it's then also faster for \ninference yeah and i think the um the \nadding of the retrieval component you \ndon't need to store the knowledge in the \nparameters of each of the separate heads \nso you can get even more efficiency \ngains of not needing to have some 12 \nlayer \n100 million parameter encoder base that \nthen attaches to each of the heads \nhopefully the retrieval model can \nreplace that and then these models can \nbe more parameter efficient so kind of \ntransitioning a bit away from the topic \nof fine tuning i was really impressed \nwhen i came across the deep set cloud \ngui it's beautiful i love looking at it \nsuch a cool way of organizing the tasks \naround constructing your say \nfirst example of vector search if anyone \nlistening to this has their data set and \nthey just want to see one of these \npipelines come together i highly \nrecommend checking out this deep set \ncloud gui it's as easy as pick your \nlanguage upload your documents \nclick and pick the components of the \npipeline from retriever question \nanswering or retriever summarization and \nthen and then even from there the rest \napi deployment and i love that idea of \njust the easy search api deployment so \nhow do you see that kind of thing of um \nof this gui interface design what kinds \nof things have gone into the uh \ninto the development of the deep \npsychology ui so \nfor us was really important to find a \nsay a complimentary product or open \nsource uh \nproject haystack we didn't want to end \nup with a with a model where we say okay \nlike there's a i know super nice \nperforming model but we don't publish in \nopen source we that's part of the uh the \ncommercial offering um at the same time \nof course we're a company we need to \nmaintain the open source project so we \nneed a sustainable business model so the \nidea \nof this combination now is really that \nwe have haystack as a python framework \nuh who really helps developers um to \nbuild easy \nprototypes and solve the problem of \nscatter technologies so \nyou have models you have databases you \nhave under rest apis it's quite hard to \nstick all of that together and \n[Music] \nhave all these skills in say one person \nor a single team and hashtag open source \nis meant for that it's a python \ndeveloper framework to solve it \nand \nif that's fine for you you can just go \nahead with that bring that to production \nbuild everything you want around it \nfine \num still what we saw is that it's not \nalways only about the technologies but \nit's also a lot about workflows about \ncollaboration and uh having really the \nwhole \num say lifecycle the \nml of lifecycle of a product and um and \nthat's why we built deepsea cloud that's \nbasically one sas platform where you \nreally can start as you said you upload \nyour corpus you index it you can \nconfigure your pipelines in different \nmodes either from code or \njust from a yammer \nthat you put there \nand you can easily share demos with \ncolleagues get your feedback hey do \nthese results make sense yes or no and \ninstead of then having this feedback in \nexcel sheets floating around you have it \nlike all integrated in your in your \ndatabase and can easily say ah like okay \ni got this feedback this pipeline is \nbetter than this one or trigger some \nretraining fine tuning based on this \nfeedback create labels so it's really \nlike all integrated \nand once you \nonce you found \nsay the perfect pipeline or that fits \nyour needs \njust basically one click \nto scale it and bring it to production \nand we will do all the the scaling in \nthe background in our cluster it's fully \nhosted and you can integrate them \nbasically the api to \nyour own product uh wherever you want \nthis functionality yeah i think this \nmodularity is so exciting this idea that \nyou can just \npoint to the api endpoint to add in some \nkind of \nsay you want to have model inference as \na part of the pipeline and you want to \njust point to the api and plug it into \nthe existing pipeline and generally the \nidea of sharing the search api is such \nthat anyone can integrate anyone's data \nset \nconnected to these pipelines by just \nquerying one of these endpoint demos and \nuh say on wev8 we have the wikipedia \ndemo and we have just the public \nendpoint so if you if anyone in their \nworking directory wants to just paste in \nthis address you can just start clearing \nthe vector search engine and people can \nshare their data sets and this is really \nexciting like open source collaboration \nof uh sharing all these different things \nand so i want to ask you kind of uh \nwe've seen things like hugging face \nspaces and and the model hub as \nthey share model weights and \nincreasingly hugging faces hosting raw \ndata sets what do you think about the \nfuture of organizing these vector search \ndemos and then having these \nability to not only just access data \nsets but to be able to just quickly \napply all these \nfunctionalities like search just through \nthese public endpoints yeah so if it's \nuh \nfor support amazing work that tuckerface \nis doing and we are \nclose exchange with them and it's really \ngreat what they are building and what \nthey're doing for the whole whole space \num \nand um like how we see how we see it and \nwhat we are doing um is basically i \nwould say one layer above probably so \nfor example we integrate with a huge \nphase model hub so \nif you use deepsea cloud you can \nbasically load any model that you have \nhosted there or that is public there and \ni still think that that right now what \nis missing is this kind of let's say \norchestration layer where you bring \nthings together we can say okay this \nmodel this data set or my own data set \num here's a quick demo and i can share \nwith my colleagues so i can \nshare it in the public um and uh and \nthat's exactly i think what \nwe are building what i think many others \nare also building i think it's important \nto \nto have um to really empower developers \nto to cover this whole say lifecycle to \nshow something and i think that's \nsomething missed also in in many uh ml \nprojects now that you \nfocus a lot on the modeling part but \nthen if you show your colleagues or \nothers \nand it's it's something quite hard to \nrelate to it and for others to try it \nout and i think this is uh so important \nlike um \nfirst of all to validate what you are \nbuilding as an engineer \nbut also to \nsay trigger creativity and and \ninspiration so um if for example people \nfrom from some business departments they \nthey saw some of our demos and um and \nthey thought ah like that's cool i \nhave some people be a different use case \nbut can i also use it for \nthis and that \nfor for example chatbots we have some \nsome people who \num who use now qa for answering \nquestions within chatbots or for \nparsing let's say if you have incoming \ndocuments every time an invoice comes in \nyou want to ask \nfive questions and uh \nlike who \nwho did issue with this invoice uh \nwhat's the amount and kind of the answer \nyou use uh used to \nstore it in a structured database and \nkick off other automated processes \nand i think all this this kind of \ninnovation is so much easier if you have \nsomething tangible something you can try \nout and and share \nwith others yeah and congratulations \nagain on the deepsea cloud gui it is \nsuch an amazing organization of this \norchestration layer and user interface \nto just point to different data set \nendpoints different retriever models and \nand now let's get into kind of these \ndifferent flavors of retriever models \nyou mentioned the idea of combining \ntfidf and bm-25 with say siamese bird \nsentence bert and having these two \ndifferent kinds of ways of \nof \ndifferent ways of structuring your \nretrieval model but i kind of think \nanother thing that's interesting as we \ntranslate into the connection between \nthe we vva document store and then the \nhaystack pipelines is the idea of \nsymbolic annotation of the neural \nvectors and of the neural search so \nfor example if you're searching through \nscientific papers and you want to add \nthe symbolic filter \npublished in cvpr or published in icml \nor authored by a particular \nwell let's say an institution could say \nan author might not have that many \npublications such that you need to \nreally do a neural search through it but \nthese kind of symbolic filters on top of \nthe neural search have you thought a lot \nabout what how that kind of changes \nneural search and how that kind of \nmaybe offers another way of looking at \nthe retrieval \npipelines between say tfid fbm25 being \none thing and then \nvector distance being a different thing \nyeah i think that's a \nan absolutely brilliant feature that vb8 \nhas and uh \nand actually i think differentiates vva \nto \nmany of the other vector search engines \nout there and um for us uh was also i \nthink the one of the main reasons why we \nintegrated into haystack because we \nheard that a lot from the community we \nsaw that a lot in our with our own \ncustomers \nthat really this combination of \nsay \nstructured data and metadata that you \ncan filter plus a \nvector search is super powerful and um \ni mean first of all it's a nice nice way \nto kind of narrow down your search day \nso if you have really like millions of \ndocuments \nin most use cases there is some \nsome text some i don't know time stamp \nsomething that you can that helps you to \nnarrow down your search space immensely \nand \nthis of course \nthe die has direct impact on \nthe search quality \num \nand at the same time it was tricky to \nimplement so it's uh \nit really has to i think be \nclosely tied to the vector search engine \num \nand has to happen if you have something \nlike approximate nearest neighbors um \nwhich i think is quite important at in \nproduction deployments and then uh it \nbecomes tricky and um and they are \nhaving this combination i think is super \nnice in general i would say \nleveraging \nmetadata or structural information as uh \nis super helpful um \none thing for example on our growth \nroadmap that you want to explore further \nas well to \nleverage document structure uh even more \nso that you can say you have \na pdf so you have like a lot of \ntitles in there \nmaybe captions of images and \nas of today most uh most search engines \nand uh and models um treat that in the \nend as \nsimilar like plain text uh but really \nusing the information hey this is \nanother headline or \num this is i don't know the the title of \nthe the chapter um this makes makes life \nso much easier at query time um and i \nthink also for uh like building \nembeddings then for these kind of uh \ninformation is a nice direction in \nfuture that we're not it's into hard \nfiltering or then \nbm25 on this kind of metadata but really \nembed those titles embed the whole \ndocument structure \nand and use that at queer time yeah and \nit's interesting because you can still \nuse these filters in the h sw uh a n \nindex algorithm so we build these data \nstructures up so that we can facilitate \nthe speed of doing vector distance \ncomparisons but you can still add these \nsymbolic filters within something like \nan h and sw graph as eddie and dillocker \nat wv8 has explained many times and \nfinally starting to understand it a \nlittle bit but um so let's get into this \num query classifier the idea that the \nquery classifies whether this is a \ntf idf query or if this is a neural \nsearch query and i want to get your \nthoughts on whether you think it's \na worthwhile direction to say have a \nquery refinement step where it adds the \nsymbolic annotation onto the neural \nquery so rather than saying oh no this \nis mostly keyword we want to make like \nsay um say you google something about a \ncompany like uber and then you want to \ndo a regular expression symbolic \nfiltering or say make sure uber is in \nthe title of the return article \ndo you think we could have a \nintermediate query refinement neural \nlayer trained with uh you know gradient \ndescent and some kind of annotated data \nset for this that would add the symbolic \nannotation onto the neural search layer \nrather than say \nseparately querying a tf idf index or \nseparately querying say like even an sql \nindex because it's like a purely \nsymbolic search \nor it looks purely symbolic different \nfrom say you know some kind of sparse \nsome kind of like machine learning style \nbased representation of the data do you \nthink that kind of thing could be uh \nfruitful yeah i mean in general i think \nit's it's uh it's an interesting \ndirection um the career classifier in \nhaystack pretty much comes from the uh i \nwould say from a \nfrom the user behavior \nwhat we saw is that um \nmany companies if they already have a \nproduct which allows search \npeople are used to keyword search right \nthat's what they type in and it takes \nsome time to um to make them aware hey \nlike there is a \nif you there's a smarter way of \nsearching right and uh if you really put \na full sentence a full question whatever \nmore context in then you get better \nsearch results and that's the same thing \nwith google right they are slowly \ntransitioning towards uh \ntowards say more contextual search and \nthey suggest queries and um they display \nhey is that what you like the question \nthat you they were asking and um and i \nthink that all goes towards this zero \nclick search that you have searched \nsomething and then you directly see what \nyou want and you don't need to click on \nthe on the website and then find what \nyou're looking for \num but i think yeah there is this uh \neducational period and um and that's \nwhere we uh where we implemented where i \nadded this clear classifier that you can \nreally see hey this is a keyword query \nuh and then maybe just use your existing \nold search engine probably just plain \npm25 or whatsoever \nand \nyou know on the other side if it's \nalready a semantic um query you can \nroute it to your to your second stack \nand uh and that really giving you \nsay both of the best of both worlds but \nif because if you have i think really \nit's like classical keyword queries \num what we saw is that at least the most \nmost dense retrievers don't work that \nwell if you just query for let's say \nuber \num \nyeah \nprobably really looking specifically for \nthis one um and and bm25 it \nprobably outperforms yeah we've talked \nabout this topic many times we love this \nterm of serendipity this idea of uh you \nknow \nnot really knowing what you're searching \nfor sort of is a good way of thinking \nabout how to \ntraverse through neural search results \nand also sort of blurring the lines \nbetween the task descriptions of uh like \nretrieval re-ranking and then \nrecommendation systems \nall kind of blurring into the same kind \nof task with searching with uh neural \nsearch and and yeah i really like the \nidea of using the user behavior as you \nkind of uh fine-tune this way of \nthinking about it so maybe thinking \nabout like \nyou know dressing up the query with \nneurosymbolic and maybe even graph \nstructured cross-referenced linking \nthen having maybe like a special user \ninput embedding \nspecific to each user based on their \nuser data or something to help them kind \nof \nex help them understand the neural \nsearch because yeah it's it's definitely \ninteresting when you search for \nsomething get a completely unrelated \nthing but because it's like this fuzzy \nway of relating the things it's \ndefinitely an interesting thing and um \nso transitioning into some kind of new \ninnovations around the space i really \nwant to get your take quickly on um \non what you think will be the impact of \nlike having longer input sequences to \ntransformers so say going beyond 512 \ntokens models like big bird sparse \ntransformer \nlong form and these kind of things of \nespecially it seems with retrieval being \nable to not just average out the \nembeddings but maybe have the attention \nwithin \nin like the parametric kind of \nprocessing within the same input um i \nthink that's a \nan obvious and a big step forward and \nand the super important one i think \nat the moment \ndevelopers pretty much got used to this \n512 tokens it already seems like a \nfixed \nconcept in the mind of developers but of \ncourse it's not and \nand \ni think it's just was for me but \nactually it's a bit surprising that it's \nuh \nit takes such long time to \nkind of make the steps i mean there's of \ncourse some some models out there big \nbird you mentioned \nlong former and so on um \nbut still i think for many tasks they \ndon't perform equally well \num i do also believe that for retrieval \nit can make a big difference um \num and um you know that one big impact i \nthink will be on the speed side if you \nyou really have an efficient model there \ni don't need to like split \ndocuments any further like in these \nthese passages have \nsliding windows and all of that \num \nit will be immensely helpful and i think \nit's just a for me it's just a matter of \ntime to \nuh that we get to a point where we don't \nthink of 512 \nanymore and i think maybe it'll come in \nparallel advances in thinking about \ntokenization like uh things like i think \nit's called engram transformers they \nlook at uh different ways to not just \nhave subword or bipolar level encoding \nwhere they have other kinds of \nstrategies of maybe tokenizing and that \nmight come into play with the \nthings like bot like computational \nbottlenecks compared to all isomorphic \nkind of transformer designs and maybe \nthese kinds of things and so one other \nthing maybe is using the document \nstructure could be a way to further \nincrease the retrieval step what are \nyour thoughts on kind of \nincorporating the structure of a \ndocument whether it's a scientific paper \nand you maybe have like this is the \nintroduction this is the related works \nand i'm sure all sorts of industry \nthings have that kind of style where \nthere's some mana it's not just like a \nblock of text from the top to the bottom \nyeah i think it becomes immensely \nhelpful if you if you go towards a real \nworld documents that are like not always \nstructured in the same way \num one example is for example uh \nso like you know company \nwikis or like short documents of let's \nsay meeting notes uh no one writes like \na full \nfull length paragraph explaining \neverything in full context but it's \noften really i know five headlines three \nbullet points that's it and \nuh what we see is that um yeah if you \nhave a model that is trained on say \nwikipedia or natural questions \nand then to try to apply it to such a \ndocument format that's quite tough and \num and that's why i think like \nmaking use of this kind of document \nstructure even more \nlike formatting what is bold and just \nlike what we used from let's say the \nvisual editor i think is also helpful to \nto give us input to our models and \nand let them leverage this as well yeah \nand i really like this paper called a \nhypertext language model where the htlm \nwhere they keep the html html tags \nfrom the web scraping so that you have \nthe uh you know ul tag li that you have \nthat kind of structure and then they do \nthings like when they're prompting it to \nget the inference they'll just add the \ntitle task to like title brackets mask \nand then it performs better because you \nthe scale of the data and the scale of \nthat kind of free annotation so then \nanother kind of thing that's like \nlurking in these text data sets mostly \nare tables and especially with you know \ni'm really interested in looking through \nscientific paper data sets and having \nthese tables and so what do you firstly \nwhat do you think is the best way to \nrepresent tables for the downstream \nprocessing is it say html tags where you \nhave say table header table row that \nmaybe i don't know \nif that's the best way of doing it i've \nseen an interesting thing of like \nwrapping it in panda's data frames and \ntrying to have that kind of pipeline \nwhat's your thinking around table \nquestion answering within this kind of \nframework um yeah so we see that's a \nsuper interesting direction and um when \nwe \nstarted with haystack pretty much \nfocusing on text data but it was uh i \nthink uh clear from from day one that \nit will evolve to more data types and \nthe vision for hashtag is really to um \nto have a semantic layer that you have \nlike any say textual input any query you \nwant to find information \nand \nquery that into your whole say data \nbase or data lake whatever is in there \nand \nand of course many others are focused on \nimages also interesting but what we saw \nfrom community and then our clients is \nactually that tables is the \nmore pressing \ndemand after the tax documents \nespecially from financial financial \ninstitutions they have like a lot of \nannual reports for example where \ninformation is stored in tables \nscientific papers you mentioned it \nin technical documentation we often have \nalso kind of table overviews \nand making sense out of that is \nsuper helpful um \nin terms of representation \nyeah i think um \nthere are there's still not really a \nstandard out there when you look also at \npapers and models how they do it um \nwhat we thought that we found is um data \nframe is from a user perspective now \nagain is kind of a standard interface \nit's not \nreally standard for the modeling part \nyet but it's a very nice let's say \nexchange format and you can easily \nget another table out of of sql put in a \ndata frame you can pass a table from a \npdf document put it in a pandas data \nframe you can do some \ninteractions easily with it you can \ninspect it \nand then you can kind of pass it down to \na model and uh how it's represented \nthere it's \nthen a bit of a question of what the \nmodel wants and expects um \nyeah so overall i think it's a it's a \nsuper interesting direction and \nlast year also like a lot of innovation \nhappened there with \ntapas making big steps forward \nbut we also recently implemented \nthere's another model called raw column \nintersection \nso i think there's still also \na lot of different approaches out there \nand we'll see which will which will make \nit at the end uh that's i think also the \nexciting part uh about this this whole \nfield still um but um i think they are \nnow at a tipping point where they become \nuseful for for industry and that's uh \nthat's quite quite interesting um \nyou they i'm not sure if everyone is \nunaware of what you can do there right \nnow but it's uh it's you can really \nask questions where the model then finds \nthe the specific cell in the table so \nyou can ask i don't know \nwho won the champions league last year \nuh or soccer champions league last year \nand it will find the the club who won \nthat um but you can do also like \naggregation operations and that's i \nthink quite quite interesting that you \ncan ask \nhow many times did uh bayern munich won \nthe championship and it would basically \nkind of create a \nsomething like a sql query and ask like \nokay where in this table is this club \nand count how often it appears or you \ncan do like an average of this \nand um \nand uh if you think this a bit further \nit opens up a whole new kind of data set \nwhich is then not only \nthe small table in the paper but it's \nreally like a whole sql table or whole \nsecret database and you have a model \nthat kind of produces the sql query and \num and i know you can have a uh maybe a \nbusiness analyst and you want to ask \nlike what's the average revenue for \nuh i don't know china last week in this \nproduct segment and you can have a \nbasically a model that builds this query \nand gives you the answer \nand um i think this would be like it's \nmore powerful yeah i love this idea and \ni've um i like this paper called turning \ntables where the idea is instead to have \nlike a \nnatural language generator from the \ntable so you parse the table into \nnatural language and then \nmaybe you know you don't have to have be \nso multi-modal between table and text \nand you just kind of have all text even \nif it's in these two different kind of \nstyles i think it would be really cool \nkind of also maybe to try collecting uh \ndata sets of \nhave a table \nthe table and then the image like the \nplot that describes what's in the table \nand then maybe also like what they call \nthe cytance or maybe like the figure \nscitants that where the figure is being \nreferenced in the text to kind of come \nup with those kinds of tuples and see if \nthat can \nkind of power the application of that \nkind of idea of \nreasoning through tables and another \nreally like kind of interesting idea i \nthink is adding images videos i think \nvideos too there's like a lot of video \ninformation things like as we record \nthis podcast and all sorts of it kind of \nis like easier to make videos than it is \nto make uh \nto write write articles and maybe also \nthere's information in the audio like \nthe tonality the way that you \nsay things probably some more \ninformation there for some applications \nwhat do you think about like image \nsearch and adding these kinds of data \ntypes as well to the pr probably like \ntext search is kind of like the dominant \nthing it seems um yeah i think it really \ndepends on the industry and um and for \nsure i think there's \neverything that is in the web is \nis mostly i'd say on these data types uh \nimages videos audio like super \ninteresting \num we had a few months ago like um \nsomething you call hacky friday so once \na month in the company every developer \nor every every employee actually can \nwork on anything right that he or she is \ninterested \nand uh and \ntwo developers there built like a \npodcast search for example where you can \nsearch for podcasts and \ni think for these kind of use cases \nthat's super nice and \nand if you also think it a bit further \num \nreally having them multi-modal models \nthat \nthat not only let's say can query it but \ncan really \nlearn from different modes and \ncombine this knowledge i think that's an \ninteresting so that you \nmaybe your company you don't have so \nmuch video data but you're using a model \nthat \nused video data to to gather um say the \nthe initial knowledge and you can still \napply it to other data sources i think \nthat's super interesting \nand \num think with uh \nsome of the current models we are \na bit going in this direction um \n[Music] \nso i think it's uh \nas we mentioned earlier um if you have a \nmultimodal model i'm still curious if um \nif these models will become then very \nefficient if you're say just using them \nfor text data or if you have like say a \nlot of overhead a lot of extra \nparameters just to \ncover let's say audio but maybe in your \ndeployment you actually don't care about \nthe audio so \nis is that really a value um \nor is it just overhead that you carry \naround and \nyou know \nlet models grow and influence times can \nexplode yeah i've been thinking about \nthat so much as well i really like this \npaper called vulcanization where they're \nable to use images to facilitate like \nthe glue benchmark for language \nunderstanding and \nuh as i'm trying to process uh like \nscientific text and deep learning \nthinking maybe the figures the \nillustrations of of the algorithms could \nmaybe be useful \nand hopefully yeah like efficiency gains \nachieved by this kind of multimodal \nfusion and and another thing uh just \nlike another kind of data modality would \nbe like graph structure \nso what do you think about graph \nstructure and i think when i think about \ngraph structure i think about how much \nthe complexity of it can kind of blow up \nunless it's like a citation graph or \nlike a friendship or like something \nthat's natively graph structured but \nthis idea of like particularly adding \ngraph linking between \nuh any kind of thing that might be in \nyour database and then maybe having like \nknowledge graph \nstyle like pie torch big graph \ndeep walk no defect these kind of \nembeddings on that kind of graph \nstructured \nuh adding it to any kind of data say \nsort of artificially um yeah i mean um \nif \nif it works out if you have such a graph \nthat's awesome i think you can leverage \nit a lot um and and do a lot of \ninteresting uh inference a lot of \ninteresting queries um \n[Music] \ni mean i think there are these two kind \nof categories right like more say \nclassical knowledge graphs \nand \nand a lot of stuff that happened also in \nthe early 2000s um \nand then more recently i would say these \nuh \ngraph neural networks \nthat that really \nuse their structure also at \nmodeling time um for the let's say the \nmore classical part more classical \nknowledge graphs um \nwe actually explored this direction um \nearlier this year because we heard it \nalso a lot from community people \num having also some some of these like \nbigger corporates for uh especially \nhaving uh such uh structures in place \num and want to invent them to use or to \nleverage at uh at such time at query \ntime \num and \nif you have a high quality graph i think \nthat's \nawesome and it's hard to beat and if you \nhave uh if you look at google search um \nstill a lot of the uh the answers uh are \npowered by um some some knowledge graph \num \nthe biggest problem that i see there in \npractice is \nif you're not one of the \ntop 10 tech companies out there um \nit still \nneeds a lot of effort to produce this \nknowledge graphs \nideally automatically you just have a \ncorpus and create this graph \nautomatically out of it \nand then to maintain it now to really \nmake sure that the quality is is \nconsistent over time if things change \nbecause \ni think the worst thing is if you have a \nknowledge graph with every knowledge \nbase if you have a knowledge group \nthat's outdated then it's \nit's it's really bad um so i think if \nthere is a way to efficiently construct \nthese kind of knowledge graphs \nthat would make a big leap um yeah right \nnow i think it's for many companies \nquite quite tough to create one yeah and \ni think there's kind of like two sides \nof as we mentioned earlier with this \nidea of query refinement and adding \nsymbolic tagging to your neural search \nthat's one way to use the knowledge \ngraph whereas the other way would be you \nuse the knowledge graph in the training \nloop to influence the vectorization of \nyour original data objects and that \nsecond one being the one that's maybe \nmore prohibitive and maybe more \nchallenging to really make it happen but \nthings like say the we v8 layer make it \nreally easy to just kind of use your \nknowledge graph annotation to to filter \nyour search and guide it and help it \nthat way whether really getting a \nmultimodal graph embedding added to an \nimage embedding text embedding that \nthing might be a little more challenging \nto really \nuh work out and practice and so that \nkind of thing yeah thinking about that \nkind of graph structured and \nwe it's definitely one of my kind of \nfavorite things about the weevil vector \nsearch so we've covered a ton of \ndifferent topics i think already and i'm \ncurious like um kind of what's on your \nroadmap in the terms of like which kind \nof idea is exciting you the most right \nnow about vector search engines overall \nso i think it's generally like what we \nuh it's a lot still about uh making \nthis uh easily scale and uh what we look \nright now or like what we implemented \nrecently is uh \nis basically deploying pipelines uh with \narray framework i'm not sure if you had \na look at it but it's like really a \nsuper exciting framework for distributed \ncomputation and uh really makes it easy \num to for example take a \npipeline with different nodes and then \nrun \nnodes independently on different \nmachines \nscale them independently \nand and have them all connected so \nthat's a second production deployment \nside and quite interesting \nthen \neverything let's say around just data \naugmentation and simplifying \nthis fine-tuning domain adaptation step \nso \num for example one paper that we \nrecently looked at is \ncalled like gpl like generated pseudo \nlabeling um \nfor unsupervised unsupervised dense \nretrievers \num \nand the idea there is basically that you \ncreate you have a model that creates \nsome query \nanswer pairs or create document pairs in \nthat case \nand \nyou use a cross encoder to \nkind of label this and score this and \ncross encoder usually gives you better \nperformance for these type of query \ntasks and that's why they're used for \nfor re-ranking um but they are rather \nslow so use this kind of let's say \nbigger model teacher model again to \ncreate a data set \nwithout any human labels just you put a \ncorpus and you get these labels \nand then you train a smaller buy encoder \nbased on this data set and i think these \nkind of \napproaches like using models like bigger \nmodels more expensive models to create \nsomething useful \nthen to create like to train a smaller \none this kind of uh \nlet's say tricks \nis what really interests me um and i \nthink are like \nquite helpful for for industry um \nthat's one direction \nthe other i think is everything around \ncontinual learning i think really \nincorporating human feedback um either \nif the model is already in production \num probably want to measure okay what \nwhat are people \nsearching \nwhat uh what do they think of these \nresults \nincorporating that in your in your model \nretraining \nbut also in earlier steps \nif you do some labeling how can you \nfuse in model predictions there like \neverything that's i would say between uh \nhuman and machine collaboration \nis what we are doing these days \num it fascinates me yeah awesome that's \na lot of interesting stuff so to kind of \nuh unpack it a little bit and go step by \nstep yeah as as we were talking earlier \nabout uh the farm fine tuning library \nand maybe things like that might be \nspecific to retrieval augmented \npipelines that idea of having the \nknowledge distillation from the cross \nencoder or like the tri encoder even \nwhere you have say query uh relevant or \nlike um \nyeah like query relevant document and \nthen like negative relevant document \nright and the kind of design of a try \nencoder or as you generalize that to \nhowever but the difference being that \nit's in the input directly and then you \nhave the attention over this whole thing \nthe idea of distilling those \nrepresentations down into the siamese \nencoder which is faster doesn't require \nas many comparisons for inference and \nyeah i think that's really interesting \nof like maybe like a unique part of a \nfine-tuning library that would be \nappended to a vector search engine \nlibrary kind of so to say \nand then yeah i really like the data \naugmentation \nuh the idea of like robustness and being \nrobust to negations and that kind of \nthing and really testing that in uh \nretrievals because uh yeah just in \ngeneral that idea that if you add like \nnot or switch the named entity it \ndoesn't react to that it sounds like a \nhuge problem for retrieval pipelines and \nthen yeah continual learning that \ncatastrophic forgetting thing definitely \nstill seems to be like the achilles heel \nof deep learning even if \nit does seem like big models somehow \ndon't aren't affected by it i guess \nbecause they have the parametric \ncapacity to store all these tasks in it \nand then kind of lastly um to come back \nto the distributed pipeline in ray and \nuh distributing the competition the \nnotes could you give me like an example \nmore so so i can better understand how \nlike what parts of the retrieval \ncomponent are being uh parallelized \nso it's uh i would say it's not so much \nabout \nsay the single retrieval um node but in \nin in haystack really more if you have \nbigger pipelines where typically let's \nsay there's a \nthis might be a dense retriever there \nmight be also a sparse retriever then \nmaybe you can find it then there's a \nreader model maybe you have a summarizer \nas well \nand \nand what ray allows you is to \nbasically \nabstract \nfrom these nodes and put them on the \nlike encrypted with the resources they \nneed so you can say okay maybe this \ndpr retriever like super heavy model \nokay let's put a gpu node on it \nbut uh maybe for \nsome i don't know sentence transformers \nor the sparse retriever um cpu node um \nand for the \nthe reader model again something else \nand um \nand \nthat's basically what you what you need \nto think of from a development \nperspective the rest is more or less \nhandled by ray um and if you will think \nabout production use cases um it's \nreally that you can let's say the deploy \nyour pipeline \nand then let it auto-scale and uh and \nwith some restrictions that you say okay \nthis node shiva is always on the gpu or \nlike there's many gpus and please equip \na new resource and spin up a new machine \nif the traffic is kind of \ngrowing and um \nand \ni would say what we are doing is \nbasically using this rare framework \nunder the hood \nuh again building the orchestration on \ntop so that it really works for for \nthese nlp pipelines retrieval based \npipelines um \ndoesn't really need to worry about \nscaling anymore so that's usually you \nneed uh like a single cloud instance and \nthen ray will wrap say like docker \ncontainers that partially like portion \nup the single cloud instance or is it \nyou have multiple machine multiple cloud \nmachines that ray is \nrouting it through entirely different \nmachines so it's kind of like a hybrid \nbetween the two where uh ray say \nconstructs these docker containers that \nsay how many what percentage of the \nresources say to use on each machine and \nthen it kind of routes through that is \nthat kind of the correct understanding \nof it yeah kind of so it's really i \nwould say like a similar bit similar to \nthe kubernetes cluster \nand you still have \nmultiple \nmachines on the cloud and then on top \nyou have this basically this ray cluster \nwhich makes use of these machines you \nhave like a master node you have some uh \nsome additional nodes and uh and and you \ncan \nsplit them the resources \nindependently so you can say really okay \ni want to use for this node uh \n1.5 gpus and uh and ray will take care \nof placing this \nuh within the cluster within the \nmachines super cool and so it kind of is \nlike a question of wrapping this up i \nwanna i'm curious about uh like as i \npersonally have been kind of navigating \ndeep learning technology and uh trying \nto learn how to build things i thought i \nfound it very useful to have kind of \nlike \none application in mind that i would \nreally like to see come together \nis that or compared to say where you're \nbuilding out a \ntechnology company like haystack and you \nsee all these different use cases what \ndo you think about kind of the \nphilosophy of either looking at like \nthinking about things that will \ngeneralize to all the applications or \nmaybe \ndigging into one specific thing that you \nwould really like to see come to life \nlike the podcast search for example yeah \ni mean so what we are i mean there's a \nlot of use cases out there that we are \nsuper curious to to see and uh \nuh and really like when this when you \nsee that from community or from clients \nbut um we as a company are not let's say \nbuilding or focusing on one of these \nsolutions um but we really \nenable these use cases and build a \nplatform that helps developers out there \nto build and to \num and to help to build these products \nand use cases \nas easily as possible and uh that's for \nme uh uh we have like a slack channel \nwhere we share this regularly like what \npeople from community share or like \ncustomers and it's just so fascinating \nto see like what what people build \nthemselves instead of let's say hey we \nbuilt or we provide \na solution for \nfinancial research it's like of course \nyou can like optimize this endlessly um \nbut it's quite narrow and uh and uh yeah \ni'm a big fan of uh \ngiving this flexibility um \nand \nat the same time probably yeah building \nthe tooling for let's say a few areas to \nreally make it easy to build these final \nuse cases yeah i think like anyone kind \nof working in almost like developer \ntools if you will like has to be able to \nhave that kind of generalist hat \nthinking where you kind of are switching \nin a use case in your head and yeah i \nthink that's a really interesting way of \nthinking about it might be do you think \nit's like harder to do it that way to \nkeep adapting to some new thing yeah i \nmean it's like it's of course if you \nhave something very generic it's i would \nsay constant back and forth like you \nknow you have like your hypothesis hey \nthat's what people need \nand then you need kind of to wait for \nokay \nthat's what they actually built with it \nand that's how they used it and this was \nmaybe helpful it's not but you always \nthink reliant on this feedback loop to \nunderstand and uh and that's why i think \nit's uh it's so important to do that on \nopen source because the feedback loop is \nquite faster you see what people are \ndoing what helps them what not and \nit really helps to build a nice \ndeveloper tooling and \nimagine a closed source you always have \nto know sell it to someone ask them for \nfeedback um \nit's just ways more away slower awesome \nthank you so much malt for coming on the \nwvva podcast and uh to anyone listening \ni highly recommend checking out the deep \nset cloud \nit's a graphic user interface for \nsetting up this haystack pipeline where \nyou select your language you upload your \ndata you can even drag and drop pdfs \nthey have a pdf extractor built into the \nhaystack library that could you could \ndrag in some say archive pdfs and then \nget your first vector search going that \nway and it's a super cool way in and \nclicking around the pipeline i think \nit's one of the most exciting uh ways to \nvisualize what's going on with plugging \nthese different parts of this end-to-end \nretrieval augmented pipeline together so \nagain thank you so much malt for coming \non the wva podcast and thank you \neveryone to listening and please \nsubscribe for more podcasts like this \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Podcast #4: On Deepset&#39;s
