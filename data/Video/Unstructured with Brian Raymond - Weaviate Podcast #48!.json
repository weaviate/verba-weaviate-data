{"text": "Hey everyone, thank you so much for watching the 48th episode of the Weaviate Podcast!! This is a SUPER exciting one, ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching the wevia podcast I'm super \nexcited to welcome Brian Raymond the \nfounder and CEO of unstructured \nunstructured is such an exciting company \nfor uh I'll explain kind of the way that \nI see the space of kind of how do you \nget day unstructured data like say PDF \nso these corporate data Lakes web pages \nall this stuff kind of getting it into \nsystems like we V8 and so I'm so excited \nto welcome Brian thank you so much for \njoining the podcast thanks for having me \nexcited to be here awesome so could you \nmaybe kick it off I know I'm going to \ngive it a course description but can you \nexplain what unstructured is in the \nfounding vision of it yeah absolutely so \num so when we we embarked in uh on this \nkind of Journey that we're on today with \nunstructured the vision was \num pre-processing is terrible nobody \nlikes it it takes forever but it's a \ncritical step if you actually want to \num deploy language models of any type \nagainst data that's important to you and \nso \num I had uh the last four years before I \nstarted on structured also the a great \ncompany called primer Ai and at primer \nwe were fine-tuning models orchestrating \npipelines building applications on top \nof them doing all sorts of really cool \nstuff with Transformer based models and \num and we we'd have these you know \nfantastic applications and we'd show \nthem to customers and say I want that on \nmy data and then um we look at their \ndata and we'd hold their head in our \nhands \nthis is going to be a huge amount of \nwork and rejections and Python scripts \nand OCR and everything just to get \neverything into typically like a nice \nclean Json format right so that we can \nfeed it into an inference Pipeline and \nso the vision when we started out was \nhey hugging face is you know exploding \nover here with um you know tens of \nthousands of models incredible Community \nwhat if we did something similar to the \nleft of hugging face and we made it \ncheap fast and easy for data scientists \nto get through that data engineering \nstep so they can consume more of that \nand so \num you know the you know initially it \nwas hey let's help folks build out these \nbespoke pre-processing pipelines to take \nsay a non-disclosure agreement that's in \na PDF you want to train a classifier \nmodel or something on it how do you get \nthat into Json or I got a bunch of \nPowerPoints or CRM data or scraped HTML \nhow do you get that to a point where you \ncan start interacting with it and \num and so for the past 10 months or so \nwe've just been been in build mode \num you know focused like a laser on \ningestion and pre-processing a little \nbit of work on connectors but mainly on \nthat transformation that file \ntransformation work to get it into a \nbase format that you can go use with \nmachine learning \nabsolutely fascinating it it really you \nknow captivating overview the thing I to \nkind of maybe to break that in so \npre-processing is this like are you \nthinking about like in the I know \nobviously there's like the PDFs to Eva \nkind of angle that we're so excited \nabout learning more about but I think \nalso you're hitting on like \nkind of like the ETL like when you are a \ndata scientist and you take like a CSV \nand you look for like missing values the \nrange of the distribution of your \nfeatures is this the kind of thing that \nyou think about like that kind of \npre-processing can you tell me more \nabout the pre-processing yeah and it's \nits own weird space here on \npre-processing with files that contain \nnatural language data and so we think \nabout it in in internally in terms of \nlike three steps okay the first thing \nyou want to do \nis you want to partition and extract \nthat the natural language data from a \nparticular file right and so if it's you \nknow a JPEG that's of a billboard or if \nit's a Word document or a text file or \nwhatever you still want to detect you \nknow you want to detect like okay this \nis the headline this is body text this \nis an image caption \num because you want to be thoughtful \nabout down down the stream about what \nyou put into your inference pipeline \num you want to extract that data and \nthat's a whole process in and of itself \nof doing that um and so Matt so once \nyou've done that once you've partitioned \nand extracted that data \num the next step in our our world is is \ncleaning and how do you get reduce it \ndown to like a clean markdown file or \nJson so there's all sorts of artifacts \nthat that that that you know wind their \nway in here so like \nsentence fragments and what weird white \nspaces and beautiful characters and all \nsorts of just like little gremlins that \njust burn up time on on cleaning that up \nand so we have spent a lot of time \nthinking about that cleaning step and so \nonce you have that clean step as a data \nscientist your job's still not you're \nnot ready yet you gotta stage it and \nthere's a lot of work that is in the \nstaging still which is Last Mile that \nburns that time so concatenation \nchunking tokenization creating \nembeddings mapping Json schemas for you \nknow maybe you want to set up a labeling \ntask maybe you want to dump it a vector \nDB maybe you want to send it to \num a hugging face pipeline whatever that \nmight be \nthere's a lot of that last mile kind of \nstaging work that has to be done so \npartition clean stage and then you're \nready for ML and all of that today is \nstill completely manual and that's why \n80 percent of data scientists work in \nthis domain it's actually on this \npre-processing stuff that they don't \nwant to be doing they want to be doing \nthe modeling and so we're trying to give \nthat time back to them \nyeah amazing \ndata science is always saying like all \nthe data cleaning the most painful part \nbut the most productive part and so yeah \nthe pro the pain point is so clear and \nthe problem being solved you know so \nuseful um so I think kind of I want to \ntake into this question of the why now \nquestion sort of like the how large \nlanguage models are facilitating \nunstructured in this technology what's \nwhat's now making it easier \nI think um what large language models \nhave done is really increase the demand \nside of the equation the right hand side \nwhere \num there's a there's a couple attributes \nof them that that are really important \none of them \nis that um from a generation and I'm not \ntelling anyone anything they don't \nalready know but like they're just a lot \neasier to use for generative tasks \num right than um than old you know kind \nof the older \num \nclass of models and so it's just the \ntime to value and the cost of value is a \nlot lower and the second is that they're \na lot less fragile a lot less brittle to \nto the data that you're putting in them \ninto the problem \nif you're using like in context learning \nor whatever and so \nwhat that has what that means for us is \nthat our Persona has shifted a little \nbit so we were in a world where you \nneeded to create these incredibly \naccurate pre-processing pipelines \nbecause if there's any noise or shift in \nthe document template or anything \nit would throw off a lot of the um the \ndownstream the structured data that may \nbe fed into a knowledge graph or \nsomething Downstream now \num there's since they're a bit more \ntolerant and there's a lot more that you \ncan do with them \num folks are saying Hey I want to use \neverything that we're producing like \nevery file type everywhere we're \ncreating \num we're recreating you know natural \nlanguage data that's relevant to our \norganization \nI want to I want to use it in \nconjunction with a language model right \nand so on our end um it's gone from lots \nof super precise pre-processing \npipelines to hey how do I take an S3 \nbucket or an Azure block full of like \nyou know just everything that you can \nimagine \nsend it through unstructured and then \ndump it and weviate and now I can chat \nmy data or interact with it that way \nright and so that's um shifted some of \nour like the Paradigm that we're \napproaching a lot of our engineering \nwork and what we're prioritizing \ngotcha got you uh so I let me get your \nthoughts on I was I remember like with \nLang chain and llama index when they \ncame out they had like a data connectors \nHub and I remember things like S3 Google \nDrive notion uh you know like or just \nlike the PDFs so what was your reaction \nto that kind of thing is that that is \nthat kind of the like a lot of the \nunstructured part is like connecting to \nthese data sources as well as the \nTransformations oh yeah I mean Jerry and \nHarrison have done just awesome work \nthere and um and unlocking a lot of this \nuh the potential over here \num we're looking to kind of build on \ntheir shoulders for \nEnterprise production grade deployments \num and it's just a slightly different \nsort of take on it that's feeding into \norange engineering requirements and so \nwhat that means in Practical terms is \nthat like \nwe're I'll talk about our connectors and \nwhat how worth thinking about connectors \nversus data loaders right and the \npopularity there and then also what \nwe're doing on the transform side that's \nnot there and really this is a story \nabout how do you enable all the data \nlike the thousands of data scientists \nout there right now that are prototyping \nfor them to go from prototype to \nproduction and I know Harrison's been \nspending a ton of time talking about \nproductionization of agents and these \nother things we're we're in this narrow \nstrike we're staying disciplined in this \nnarrow strike zone of ingestion and \npre-processing so on the connector side \nsome some things that differentiate our \nabstractions from \num from those data loaders are that um \nthe data letters are kind of grabbing \neverything and moving them over we're \nable to \num ascribe canonical \num numbers to them until we can measure \nnet new and so not grab everything and \nso we're not like you're not shifting a \nlot of duplicate data in \num and then also thinking about \nscheduling and these will be these will \nbe supported by us so if they break in \nthe middle of the night unstructured \nwill fix it kind of like a 5tran type \napproach but they're built for the \nground up from the ground up with llms \nin mind and so um some other things like \nthey real we're building them in such a \nway that they lend themselves to \nparallelization across like CPUs and so \num and so that's like a whole discussion \nin and of itself on the connector side \nbut once you connect and you grab that \ndata that net new data from G drive or \nSharePoint or Azure blob or whatever \num we're doing all that transform work \nthat you know the partition clean \nstage right and then handing off \nlike our goal is our is for our users to \nbe able to take raw data grab it \ntransform it and then hand off wherever \nit might go might be a vector database \nlike leviate without having to worry \nabout any additional data engineering \nit's ready to go and so we've gone from \nraw to ml ready \num with an instruction \nand so um so I think that there's a huge \ninnovation in I wanted to talk about \nthis kind of like PDFs to weavia I think \nthis is one of the most exciting topics \nis that you know we've seen this at \nhackathons and stuff as people they want \nto chat with their PDFs because it makes \na lot of sense so could we talk about \nthe Innovations in unstructured like how \nwould you process a PDF with \nconstruction \nyeah we're we're trying we're doing a \nton of internal r d work right now um in \nthis area that um expands a few \ndifferent approaches and \nwe're what we're imagining in our uh for \nour kind of Target Persona or our folks \nthat are pro like our organizations that \nare producing huge volumes of data today \nso we're thinking a lot about compute \nefficiency like some of the large \norganizations that we're working with \ntoday \num create and process more than like a \nquarter million files a day and so you \ndon't want to burn up all your compute \nBudget on pre-processing right and llms \nare even though you can use llms for \nsome of these things they're about a \nhundred times more expensive than the \napproaches that we're taking and so \nwe're like okay how do you render the \nhighest quality data with the least \namount of compute so that you can get to \na chat your data type approach and so \none of them um we're taking like yellow \nX and we're you know fine-tuning that on \nour internal label data we got like tens \nof thousands of pieces of label data \nthat we've been curating over the last \nseveral months \num and so that's you know yolax's \ncreating the bounding boxes you know \nchoose your OCR vendor act whatever \num and then couple it with our staging \nbricks and now voila you're ready to \nrock and roll that's one approach \nanother approach is like a donut based \napproach so uh ocrls Vision trends like \nswim um Vision Transformer where we've \nbeen doing a lot of work there \nsome performance you know benefits and \ntrade-offs between that and an OCR \napproach and then also implications for \ncompute \nand and so that's like another one \nyou'll be seeing those apis coming out \nsoon our general pipeline which is \num realized more on like you know more \ntraditional CV and NLP approaches and \nthat's available today and then we're \nalso um pre-training Our Own Foundation \nmodel from the ground up \num that's our own Vision Transformer \nwhere we've curated all the pre-training \ndata and we've curated all the \nfine-tuning data and with the with the \nidea being hey let's train a model that \nyou can throw almost anything at it and \nit's seen it and it can you know um \ntransform it and render it with a high \ndegree of performance that's in process \ntoo we actually are just starting we're \njust wrapping up pre-training and \ntransitioning to fine-tuning on that and \nso the goal is by mid-summer to have a \nwide range of different kind of like \narrows in our quiver that our users can \ncan use to um to get over that hump and \nto get to that clean Json \namazing a couple things I want to take \napart for firstly I think just your \nknowledge of the the state of the art \nand OCR and I think swin Transformers \ncan you maybe just kind of explain that \nmore because I you know I I know I don't \nknow that much about it I'm sure our \nlisteners are curious about it sure I \nthink I mean at a high level here a lot \nof the approaches to date have been okay \num infer bounding boxes around \num around document elements \nand there's some models that that work \npretty well on that we we've been doing \na lot of really focused work on on I \nmean \nfolks the stuff that'll just put a lot \nof people to bed uh to sleep but um how \ndo you accurately draw a bounty box \naround an image caption and \ndifferentiate that from a list from a \nheader or a footer or any of these \nthings so that you have \naccurate metadata tags so you can strip \nall that stuff out and focus like a \nlaser on exactly what you want \nDownstream so you can curate your data \num and so that's you know Vision you \nknow \num a computer vision model coupled with \nOCR to do the extraction and then you \nknow you can do some last mile tuning \nbefore you roll \non the um Vision Transformer based \napproach \num it's it's really interesting so it's \nyou know it's it's tiling up a um a \nparticular image and um and it's it's \nusing an OCR list approach with so it's \na vision encoder and then a text decoder \nin order to do the jump from an Imogen \nto Json out and um and you know we were \npretty optimistic about that approach \nboth from a compute standpoint and a \nperformance but depending on the needs \nof the user if the user is going to need \nlike coordinates for traceability like \nwhere a particular extraction came from \nand which page and where on a document \num you know those all those specifics \num May necessitate different like a \ndifferent approach and so our goal is to \nhave like a nice wide menu of approaches \nthat kind of balance \nfeatures with with compute efficiency \nit's so interesting to learn about all \nthis I mean I \nwell I oh well I want to come back into \nthe plans of the foundation model I'm \nvery curious like how you're seeing \ntraining a custom Foundation modeling \nexactly what that'll look like for \nunstructured but I have to quickly I'm \ncurious about like with the \num so so with visual document layout and \nthen I'm I feel like web scraping is a \nhuge application of this where I'm like \nyou know we also just record a podcast \nwith the Kappa guys who took all the \ndocumentation blog posts of weviate and \nput it into one of these retrieval \naugmented systems and I mean it's really \nremarkable and yeah so so like you could \nyou just point me to a web like if I \njust had weevier.io just this website \nhow would you then go about getting all \nthe data out of it like so like what \nwe're doing is \num instead of trying to parse the HTML \nlike really effectively and because it \ncan be like there's nothing there's some \nsolutions for it that work pretty well \nbut they're not like \nfantastic \nso what we're doing is instead we're um \nwe're reassembling the web pages and \nthen Imaging those pages and then um and \nthen feeding that those essentially like \nscreenshots of the web pages through the \nmodel right in order to do that \num and we think that that approach and \nthere's been some recent \nlike really great Twitter threads and \nsome some papers on this \nthe compute efficiency of these computer \nvision models is coming down and so you \ncan do that at scale and the performance \nof those extractions \num is going to be a lot better than what \nyou can do in just the pure HTML parsing \nyeah that that is incredibly exciting I \nmean I think \nyeah wow it's really like you're really \npainting a compelling vision for the \nfuture of multimodal I think about just \nlike you know I like I like to read a \nlot of scientific papers and I think \nabout how much information is captured \nvisually in the diagrams but then the \nnext question and this is something that \ncome that I've heard so many times with \nthe vector search is like so with tables \nyou can also kind of like extract tables \nand you know charts and stuff so is so \nyeah I mean I don't know if it's the \nquestion is maybe pretty self-ob obvious \nI think you do the same kind of thing as \nthe OCR models and all that so yeah so I \nthink it would be a good transition to \ncome back to that Foundation model um so \ntraining Your Own Foundation model to do \nthis kind of \nI want to say document layout parsing is \nthat kind of the idea yeah yeah raw to \nJson \num for files that contain natural \nlanguage and so feed in anything almost \nany file \num and what the approach that we're \ntaking is \nconvert it to with this particular model \nof other options but with this \nparticular model convert everything to \nan image Vision encoder text decoder and \nyou get Json out and it has \num \ninstead of just one big brick of text \nwhich is kind of like what you have with \nthe document loaders now right what \nwe're doing is we're saying taking \nSnippets out and saying okay this is the \ntitle and having a title metadata tag \nand this is a body type body text Chunk \nso and so forth and so you can be much \nmore thoughtful about one what you're \nwanting to store and then two what \nyou're feeding into prompts right \nDownstream and so again everything at \nthe end of the day is going to come down \nto speed and cost of compute and you can \nchew up a lot if you're doing this in \nproduction for an Enterprise \num without without having done that work \non the on the on the front end and so \nthe the goal then with this with this \nlarger model then is \ntake huge volumes of heterogeneous data \nand then you can curate it very \nthoughtfully \num before you decide to go spend a bunch \nof money on all of it within the LM and \nlike Jerry over it well I'm going to get \na great piece in medium just um just \nlast week looking at at Claude at 100 \n000 token window it's a dollar a prompt \nalmost every every time you query the \nmodel I mean if you're doing this across \nan organization \nright like that's going to add up in a \nhurry and so what could you do to maybe \navoid having it look across a hundred \nthousand tokens and do you want to right \nyeah and that brings me to one of the \ntopics I'm most excited to talk to you \nabout which is this kind of like uh \nextracting structured data from \nunstructured data and to as a quick \nbackground like with weaviate Vector \nsearch in addition to doing Vector \nsearch or hybrid search we also have \nwear filters so if you want to say like \nyou know where web page equals webaio or \nlike where price equals less than or \nlike price is less than 100 like these \nkind of symbolic filters they integrate \nwith the hsw vector index to facilitate \nusing this kind of structured data in \naddition to searching through the text \nchunks or bricks I think that I like \nthat abstraction a lot think about as as \nbricks but so I wanted to get your \nthoughts on this one paper and I'll give \nit tldr quickly but just in case you \nknow people for everyone out there so \nthis paper is called evaporate code plus \nis the name of the algorithm and so what \nyou do is say you're looking at \nWikipedia pages of MBA players first you \nlook at a subset so like Kevin Durant \nJason Tatum LeBron James in it and so \nfrom you look at this whole thing with \nexpensive large language model take out \nthe symbolic attributes like college \nheight years in the NBA let's say and \nthen you say and then the large language \nmodel writes python programs to extract \nthose feature those attributes and then \nyou generalize the python programs to \ndoing the rest of the Wikipedia Pages uh \nso hopefully that was a good explanation \nof the technique and if if it's not \nunclear I'd be happy to clarify but if \nyou think about that kind of like \nuh bootstrapped like here are the \nattributes and then here's a way to \nextract the attributes from unstructured \ndata \nyeah I think um once you get it into \nthat claimed Json that's prepped and \nready to go like \nwe think there's a lot of complexity in \nconnecting to everywhere that an \nEnterprise or an organization stores a \nlot of this data and then hauls along \ntele file formats and so \nwe've been less focused to date on \ntrying to adapt like gpt4 or a Bard or \nsomething like that in order to do all \nof that \num because \nover time we may pivot if the compute \nefficiency improves and like the \nperformance improves of that to say okay \nlet's \nlet's build an ingestion and \npre-processing platform for the ground \nup to do that get it into that base \nformat and then use llms on top of that \num on on top of that uh that data um \nit's just going to be a lot faster and a \nlot cheaper and it's going to be more \nperformant for the most part right now \nand I think you're seeing some of these \nchallenges with like agents \num right now and moving them into \nproduction like incredibly promising \nincredibly exciting \nnobody's using them in production really \nyet right and it's going to be a while \nand so \nlike we welcome open source Community \ncontinuing to like to to work on that \nand like as they progress like we make \nwe may pivot on our strategy but we're \nmost bullish on putting the llms against \nthe clean Json \num and then asking because you're just \nasking a lot less of the model which \nmeans that that the structured data that \ncomes out the other end is going to be a \nlot a lot higher quality \ngotcha I think I'm starting to \nunderstand about it so so say I have \nlike uh you know like parquet files or \nCSV files or um you know maybe I have \nlike a graph database like I have some \ndata in neo4j and I come to unstructured \nand I say hey could you transform this \ninto like I need a weevia database could \nyou turn this into could you like read \nthe documentation and learn about \nhowever you transform data from one file \nto another is that kind of the general \nthinking and so could you could you shed \nmore light on what exactly that looks \nlike because I'm sure you have a lot \nmore and knowledge about that thing yeah \non the other side we've done a lot of \nwork on staging bricks on like \num on like Json or markdown \nTransformations and so once we get it \ninto a particular base format um or dfv \num adapting it to what's needed and this \nis really like last year we were doing a \nlot of work around like label studio and \nsnorkel and label box and like the long \ntail of labeling you know vendors and \nthen also some of the NLP vendors and \neveryone had like a slightly different \nJson schema requirement and so we were \ndoing a lot of work on \nthese staging bricks which would take a \nbase one and then adapt it to the the \nschema that's required for that \nparticular Downstream application and um \nwe're probably gonna need to do continue \ndoing more more of this but \nagain like our our kind of you know our \nstrike zone is okay I have a file that \ncontains natural language and I need to \nget that into a consistent format so \nwhen I can curate it for you know to \ncreate a knowledge graph or something \nlike that right and so \num that's that's really kind of the sand \ntrap for data scientists today and where \nI don't think we claim that we've solved \nit by any means but we're we're you know \nwe're running hard against that that \nparticular problem set \nit really I mean I think like so so if I \ncould understand the problem a little \nbetter so I know things like you know \nsay I have some kind of special \ncharacter in my unstructured text that \nwhen I try to decode it it's like you \nknow ASCII can't decode this character \nis it so mostly thinking about problems \nlike that like where you're it \nyeah the the and those are those are \nbound and so we have all those cleaning \nbricks around those those types of \nproblems right that are just focused on \nthat that we're trying to actually embed \nthose cleaning bricks into these models \nand so these models are are doing the \npartitioning the extraction the cleaning \num all in one Gap and then you can stage \nit however you can make those choices \nthat you want with our cleaning I mean \nour staging bricks Downstream but that's \num \nthat's where like you know data \nscientists that are dealing with this \nnatural language data that are needing \nhigh quality \num you know high quality pre-processing \nthat's where they're getting bogged down \ntoday on just writing custom python \ncustom regexes including them and then \nif you change the document template a \nlittle bit everything breaks and they \ngot to start over again right and so \num it's that sort of that that step \nright there that um we think we're \nprobably delivering the most value \nso is it correct like I'm thinking about \nmaybe like with um \nlike uh how with like say like no SQL \nsystems you have like this evolving \nschema you can transform your schema as \nyour data kind of evolves and you're \nadding new properties attributes and \nthen it's kind of like the syncing up of \nthat at massive scale \nit could be one other part of it what \nwe've done is we've come up with like \nour own ontology just mainly because the \none hat that doesn't exist yet um \nelements so instead of like \num of columns and rows it's like okay \nlike we we featured a lot of thinking \nthat's like over the winter in the \nspring we're like okay like we don't we \nneed a bunch of categories but we don't \nneed too many categories \num of like you know what what are common \nacross receipts and Powerpoints and \nmemos \nright and like yeah in the natural \nlanguage domain where like you know some \nof them I mentioned already but like \nlists and headers and Footers and \nadvertisement and captions all of these \nthings and so what you end up with are \ntokens fans with a metadata tag to what \ntype of document out like Universal \ndocument element that corresponds to and \nso you could say oh I want to like \nexclude all of the headers and Footers \nand captions from what I send to wevia \nbecause I don't want those getting \nsucked up into what I'm prompting \nagainst for example right with an llm \num or you know I want everything or I \njust want to isolate some things and so \nyou can that's that allows like this \nrapid curation rather than having to \nguess and check you know writing regexes \nand Python scripts and then changes then \nthe Smith categorizing it \num you can do that \neffortlessly with our toolkit \noh so yeah that quick list of the \nPowerpoints receipts that helped me help \nto click for me a little more just like \nwow like how much how much information \nis visually organized I have to yeah \nlike I'm so biased in my own like \nexperience of thinking just about like \nyou know archive papers and like blog \nposts is the thing but I mean can you \ntell me more about just like what you're \nseeing with all the information out \nthere that's like a visual document \nlayout like you I don't know I mean \nPowerPoints receipts are you \nI mean the the world that we like the \nthe customers we're talking to are \nprimarily large organizations and just \nthink about like okay \nhow many data loaders have all the all \nthe developers that are supporting llama \nindex and um and link chain and others \ncome up with right and a lot of those \nare kind of like easier data set and \nthen you have like you have Salesforce \nand you have HubSpot \num on the other hand you have slack and \nyou have notion and then you have stuff \nthat's out there on the internet and \nthen you have \nwho knows what in G drive or in \nSharePoint and then you have historical \nthings that are that are stored in an S3 \nbucket right that nobody's ever done \nanything with you have recordings of \npodcasts and things like that right you \ncan run through your texts \noh but the bottom line all of this like \nthere's this whole world of private \ninformation that organisms are \ngenerating every day that's specific to \ntheir particular mission right and \nthe pro like the exciting thing here is \nlike how do we like for them it's how do \nwe take what's out there and publicly \navailable \nwhat we're generating internally \nsomewhere like weeviate and then utilize \nit in conjunction with an llm hire to \nenhance productivity or to make better \ndecisions \nand um maybe we write memos a particular \nway maybe we make presentations a \ncertain way maybe there's this \nhistorical knowledge about how we do \nthings and I could query you know I have \nthis vision of being able to query it \nhow do we take all that valuable natural \nlanguage data that's everywhere and then \nget it into eviate for example right and \nand utilize and touch with llm like \nthat's what's so exciting for these \norganizations right now but that's there \nthere's some huge bottlenecks along that \nthat Journey for them to to navigate \namazing I mean I think about like how \nlike within our company how information \nis kind of like visually organized and \nlike notion and Confluence and you know \nmaybe like even like a jira board you \ncould visually look at it and then parse \nit out from that and even just like as I \nwas doing did that you know let's list \nout some things I started thinking about \nlike resumes that are visually organized \nand parsing that out yeah it's all just \nincredibly interesting so let me ask you \nabout this kind of chunking and \ndetermining Atomic units for text so we \ngenerally with text embedding models try \nto get it to around like 512 tokens and \num so like with you know Lang chain has \nthis recursive character splitter thing \nas a part of their PDF ingestion or like \nas part of their data ingestion Library \nwhere basically what it does is you know \nit like if if you have like it has a few \nelements to it so firstly like if you \nhave 1500 tokens It'll like junk it up \nthe first 512 an x512 and the remaining \nthing send that all out to the database \nor whatever or it'll be like if you're \ntrying to parse like a python file It'll \nlike particularly have delimiters for \nlike new lines or like def for the \nfunction like these kind of little \nthings um so do you think there's a lot \nof innovation in chunking yeah I think \nlike what we're at least for on RN I \nthink Harrison's on the right track with \num with the recursive text splitter I \nthink where where we're going with that \nis \num chunking into increasingly smaller \nsmaller units that have the metadata \ntags associated with it and so you're \nnot like let's use a web page for \nexample let's uh let's say you scrape a \nNew York Times \num along New York Times article right \nand what will happen right now is like \nthat'll get chunked into you know 512 \ntoken spans or something like that right \nbut within that you'll have \nadvertisements you'll have links to \nother articles you'll have image \ncaptions \nyou'll have you know all sorts of stuff \nright maybe a text box about the author \nor about a related article and all of \nthat mm-hmm \nin an ideal world like if you're if \nyou're just doing chat your data it \nprobably doesn't matter as much if \nyou're wanting to continuously update \nknowledge graphs or like Salesforce or \nsomething like that using llms matters a \nlot more and so what you want right is \nto say okay here are these here's this \nchunk of like maybe body text has said \nthat's it's split up by 512 tokens right \nbut then I know that this is an \nadvertisement and I know this is a text \nbox and talking about something else and \nI know that \num you know these other elements aren't \nnecessarily related to the topic of this \narticle right here that's corresponds to \nthis headline \nand so you can just do a little bit of \nwork on the front and like throw in \nstructured \num so that you're not asking nearly as \nmuch of the llm and that when you're \nready to turn the corner from chat your \ndata to continuously update knowledge \ngraphs or automate \num there's going to be a lot less noise \ngoing into that data itself \nyeah it's super interesting and I really \nI do want to like so you mentioned \nknowledge graphs and this is probably \nlike the \nthe most use of structure is to you know \nconnect each chunk to how it's like \nrelated to another chunk in this kind of \nthing \num well earlier I had mentioned this \nkind of idea of just adding symbolic \nfilters to your chunks and then using \nleviate to Surf through these symbolic \nfilters and then like it reminds me of \nsay like the text to SQL kind of \nresearch where you could have an llm \ngenerate a query that adds symbolic \nstructure to the semantic search query \nbut \nbroadly what I want to ask you about is \nwhat is your sentiment on knowledge \ngraphs do you think knowledge graphs are \nyou know like like if you're betting on \nknowledge graphs as being more or less \nimportant as you know in the next three \nto five years \nI think like what we see in the in the \nlast six months has been the fact that \nlike chat your data has captured \neveryone's attention and I think that \nthat's going to continue and it's \nincredibly exciting what I also think is \nthat for a lot of business processes and \norganization processes \num you need a high degree of precision \nin order to hand things off to \nautomation \nand that is in the realm of of knowledge \ngraphs and so if it's classification to \nlike you know in a or topic modeling on \nthe one hand to entity extraction to \nrelation extraction among entities \num and then and then more right those \nare still like there's still a ton of \nmanual human work being done in those \nareas that \nlike the previous generation \ntransform-based models were good at but \nreally expensive to set up and really \nbrittle \nand that like you didn't see widespread \nadoption of NLP across like Fortune 50 \nFortune 500 organizations \nin large part because there's a huge \neconomic problem around it the economics \nare changing in a really positive \ndirection but \num but with it's still not a solved \nproblem and so I think like we have a \nrenewed opportunity \num as as an NLP Community to go and \nattack that and to drive that value but \nthat value has not been delivered yet uh \nby and large right it's been it's been \nprototyped and it's been described and \nthere's been lots of cool Twitter demos \nbut like there's still thousands and \nthousands of humans doing things that \nthat model can do well and so now we \nhave a chance to go back and re-attack \nthat and so I think you're gonna have \nlike there's just you know the \ngenerative tasks and um and others where \nchat your data or prompt your data is \nbetter but there's still a lot that like \nstructure like the creation and \nmaintenance of knowledge graphs are \nnecessary if you're going to hand it off \nfrom humans to uh to models \nI think um yeah so with with the \nknowledge graphs I I'm just really \ncurious like um \nif we could unpack a little more of when \nyou need to use a Knowledge Graph I \ndon't mean to be like because I'm just \nkind of skeptical I honestly I'm like \nto me I think the best thing about a \nknowledge graph is that if we link \ntogether the how chunks are related to \neach other maybe we can use some kind of \ngraph neural network to kind of have \nembeddings flow through the graph and \nmaybe get a more contextual sense of the \nembeddings that's more so how I like a \nKnowledge Graph can you tell me just \nlike about when you query like because \nyou have the the relational tuples like \nConor and then you know all the things \nabout me says an example can you tell me \nmore about like how you query knowledge \ngraphs and how that's useful in business \nyeah I think um look there's events and \nthere's entities \num right and the entities can be \norganizations they can be skus they can \nbe um like uh supplier relationships \nthere's all sorts of things right and \nthen there's all sorts of um structured \ndata associated with that relationship \nto um to meaning like what are key \nevents that happened \num what are the transactions \num lots of things that are described in \nnatural language that aren't that not \nnecessarily be in um in a structured \nformat already that you need to go \nattach to that record \num right if you're actually going to \nhand things off and so \num let me give you an example we were \ntalking with um an investment advisory \nfirm \num several months back \nand they advise like endowments and \nothers on investments and then and they \nthemselves are receiving every month \nhundreds of limited part LP reports uh \nMcKinsey reports \num like some like Consulting reports \nlike all sorts of of data um some kind \nof in a gray area if it's private or not \nsome really private and they have a \nwhole team of people that are just \nreading them and then just updating them \ninto a CRM so that they have like a \nhundred percent accurate information on \nany particular business entity at any \ngiven time to inform investment \ndecisions \nyes you can put an llm on top of that \nand ask questions but are you we're \ngoing to trust it with a 100 million \ndollar decision probably \nprobably not right and so if you're \ngonna feed in all of those PowerPoint \ndecks the McKinsey reports those LP \nmemos all that sort of stuff and you \nwant to create a hundred percent \naccurate or 99.99 accurate records about \ncertain Securities organizations \num You're Gonna Want like very high \nquality Knowledge Graph associated with \nit even though you could chat your data \nhow the llms demonstrate that level of \nperformance of the previous generation \nof Transformer based models \num like it's going to be a challenge \nright and so that's there's that's \nprobably the more common NLP use case \ntoday than Goldman Sachs wanting to chat \nall of their data across all of their \ndivisions \nyeah amazing I mean that example really \nlike lit a fire under my ass of the \nthinking about I'm Goldman Sachs and I \nnow the like the hallucination thing of \nyou give it the thing that hallucinates \nso how are you thinking I mean that's a \ngreat example of a hallucination case \nwhere you just absolutely cannot \nhallucinate \num maybe we could talk about this topic \nquickly about the Innovations and \nhallucinations like it seems like there \nare some things you like as the language \nmodels get better and better it's \nbecoming less of a problem that maybe I \ncould just um \nwell I guess it's gonna do things like \nwith the knowledge graph thing it's like \nis like do I need these Tuple like it's \nentity relation entity this is how I \nshould have my data structured in order \nto hand it to the Goldman Sachs LM or \ncan I just have it kind of be Ascent \nlike a natural sentence that comes out \nof a retrieval engine to hand to the \nlarge language model yeah I think I mean \nyou deal with a lot of like type 1 \nanti-2 problems here of like hey did I \num is is what's being generated anchored \non something real uh or on something you \nknow that that bears a significant \nresemblance or another thing is like \num is it missing something in the \ngenerative side right is there um an \nunknown unknown right and so um like \nboth of those are are critical to \nactually saw like putting this into \nproduction and so I think like by and \nlarge hallucination has is a lot \nless of a problem than it was than we \nthought it was maybe six months ago from \nlike an open source developer Community \nperspective from a production \nperspective \num this is an area ripe for Innovation \num because we might be able to make sure \nthat like what is generated is anchored \non something real but I haven't seen a \nwhole lot yet around making sure that \nyou have a totality of information of of \nthe right information being rendered for \nyou and like look you can look at like \nthe you know like Google's llm versus \nopener eyes LM and some of the horse \nracing just in the past few days between \nthem on on what they're returning from \nprompts from very similar prompts and \nit's still early days right and so \nthat's not to say that these aren't \nincredible but like you know there's I \nthink there's still a Chasm between \npure like Jasper AI generative \napplications and replacing humans that \nare doing \num knowledge generation work right today \nyeah amazing and yeah so I think it was \na really great coverage of all these \ntopics I think what you've hit on with \nthe um \nparticularly kind of the visual document \nlayout is what originally drew me to \ninstruction I think you have hit such an \nimportant part of this kind of flow of \nthese retrieval augmented LM Vector \ndatabase all the world that we're in and \nand yeah it was so interesting learning \nabout all how you think about all these \nthings like the data connector uh like \nyou know flowing data from say like \nparquet into the Json as you describe \nall that is so interesting um before we \nwrap up maybe uh do you have any like \nexciting upcoming announcements or any \nuh tips and viewers for where to catch \nup with you \nyeah I'd say um you know we're in our \ncommunity slack um welcome others to hop \non in we have our our Engineers are in \nthere full time answering questions the \nones who are building that are answering \nquestions correct and so we have an \namazing team \num keep your um stay tuned for um some \nnew models to be dropping over the next \neight eight weeks we're going to have a \ngood steady drip of those and just \nwelcome feedback we're trying to build \nthrough real problems through real real \nusers and um and Leverage The Power of \nthis open source community and so \num grateful for any contributions or \nfeedback anyone anyone provides but \nConnor thanks for having me on \nthank you so much for your time Brian \nand yeah not to not to keep rolling out \non the Azure but I as I did my list and \nthat that new when you mentioned the \nsuite of the new extraction models we \nare definitely going to be on top of \nthat at weba trying to you know get help \npeople get their data into using these \ntools from unstructured and yeah thanks \nagain thanks \n", "type": "Video",
