{"text": "Thank you so much for watching the 41st episode of the Weaviate Podcast with Mem Co-Founder Dennis Xu! Mem is one of the ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nchecking out another episode of the \nweeviate podcast I'm super excited to \nwelcome Dennis Zhu co-founder of mem is \none of the most exciting note-taking \nsoftwares out there and I think with \nthis latest boom in large language \nmodels you know gbt4 and all this this \nkind of Knowledge Management like the \nnext generation of note taking and just \nhow you organize your information is one \nof the most exciting applications and so \nI'm so excited to hear Dennis's ideas \nand how you're thinking about these \nideas so firstly Dennis thank you so \nmuch for joining the weekday podcast \nthanks so much for having me Connor \nawesome so could we maybe dive in with \nkind of the the founding vision of mem \nlike this what's new with yeah \nabsolutely yeah I mean so I I think you \nknow the \nthe story goes back pretty far \num you know back in 2014 actually my \nco-founder and I \num \nwe uh we were both doing our freshman \nyear and internships right and we were \nsaying we were sitting at a restaurant \nand uh you know I pulled out my phone \nand I said \ngiven all that you know given how large \nyour digital Footprints are \ngiven all that our phones actually know \nabout us and capture about us \nit's isn't it incredible how little that \nwe can actually leverage that \ninformation and that knowledge in order \nto actually then help us do things in \nour day-to-day lives \neven as simple things as you know \nremembering \num remembering things that we wrote down \nin the past before which fundamentally \nis what note-taking is about right and \nand that's kind of like what we started \nwith which is you know what is this \nUniversal behavior that every single \nperson at some point in their life does \nwhether they write it in a note or or \nthey do it by sending you know a text to \nthemselves or whatever that is \num to Simply help remember things and \nthat was kind of like the you know the \nthe origin and the beginning of a lot of \nthose ideas and one of the things we \nimagine is well what if you could \nactually then uh create the structured \nrepresentation we called it the me API \nright where you know you could carry \nthis identity of you right anywhere that \nyou would go \num and you know essentially compiling \nnotes into into knowledge into the \nstructured Knowledge Graph this \npersonalized Knowledge Graph \num and and yeah that's that's kind of \nhow a lot of the the idea began but \num one of the things that we we've kind \nof always known is that you know notes \nwere would be where we start \num but the vision has always kind of \nbeen far bigger than that right it's um \nlike what we're building on them is \nbasically it's a personalized knowledge \nof this thing for every individual for \nevery team every organization \num and it's \nnow obviously we live in a super \ninteresting time where you know it feels \nlike I've waited my whole life for this \nmoment in technology is our car \num we've always had you know there's \nalways been things that machines have \nbeen better at humans at you know we've \nknown that for a long time \nbut those have always you know \ncomputation right or their process \ninformation faster \nbut we've kind of always assumed that \nthere were just you know these dumb \nobjects that required uh instructions \nand very explicit instructions that you \nknow had to be programmed by by an \nindividual and now I think we've finally \ncrossed the threshold where machines \nactually understand human language and \nyou know we can talk about the semantics \nof whether it's just predicting the next \ntoken how much of that is understanding \nbut you know I was having a conversation \nwith a friend recently and and you know \nhe said something that was really \ninteresting which as well \nif you think about the objective \nfunction of a human \num it's simply to reproduce but think \nabout all of the different things that \nwe have developed over time that have \nnothing to do with reproduction right \nand all of these capabilities right and \nso \num right you know regardless of all that \nthe the premise is now that we've \nmachines that can understand human \nlanguage \nthe the power of this personal Knowledge \nGraph that you can build you know this \npersonal assistant that you can build \nfor anyone \num is uh \nthat's pretty cool \nyeah it's super fascinating I think I \nfirst came across mem when I would I'd \nwrite these like Twitter threads of AI \npapers and I'd see someone would comment \nuh at Mehmet to save it to the to them \nand I and that's how I first came back \nand wear this and seeing how it extends \nfrom just a note taking out to how it \nconnects with other data sources with \nyou know Twitter being the example I \njust gave but you know I'm sure you're \nacknowledged by all these different data \nsources that your you know information \ncould be hooked into and I there's \ncertainly a lot of to unpack in the \nstory I really like that thing you said \nabout the personalized uh kind of \nKnowledge Graph I like this I like we \nhave this one idea kind of ineviate land \ncalled ref to VEC which is about how you \nyou know have a user and then you \ninteracted with these items and that's \nhow you form an embedding for that user \nand some of these yes yeah yeah and I \ncan imagine these kind of like Pages \nwhere you know say I create like a \nbiology page and I start saving some \nthings and then I have this embedding \nfor biology and I hook that up into all \nthese external sources as well and then \nit's like yeah analyzed \nyeah and you know I think what you're \ngetting at is like everything that we \nactually do nowadays is captured in one \nway or another digitally \num and you can create really rich \nembeddings that represents you know the \ncurrent context and context really ends \nup being in most and almost like every \nassisted experience what what ends up \nbeing the the the key piece that's \nmissing right like if you know if you \nknew exactly what I was thinking at any \ngiven point in time \num it's actually not you know \nridiculously hard to to surface the \nrelevant information \num at that point to you but it's just \nyou know do we know what you're thinking \nat any given point in time right so yeah \nthat that that idea is very interesting \nyeah so and so I really kind of maybe \nfor the sake of the podcast and being \nentertaining I want to hop right into \nthis gbt4 topic like how is this just \nkind of maybe the almost the clickbaity \nthing like how is this going to change \neverything \nuh yeah I think you know I so so here's \nhere's the big thing I think you know \nI've heard a lot of people talk about \nhow \num \nyou know gpt4 versus gpt3 and gpt3 is \nkind of this you know very vague term at \nthis point because it's gone through you \nknow three different evolutions and \npeople have always called the gpt3 but \nyou know the earliest versions of gpt3 \nwere nowhere near uh you know uh well I \nguess like turbo 3.5 now or even Da \nVinci you know two before that right and \nI I think it's it's pretty interesting \nto me \num I think there's there's a lot of use \ncases where you're not really going to \nnotice \nthat many differences between chat GPT \nand gpc4 \num and I think for a lot of use cases it \nfeels oh it's like slightly better it's \ndefinitely better it's slightly better \nbut it's slower blah blah blah right and \nthen there's there's one thing in \nparticular that that you know at least \nwe've been experimenting with that we \nfound \num that I think is groundbreaking and is \nobviously being slept on is just the \nability \num for this to write code uh and to \nwrite incredible sound code that is \nbetter than extremely experienced \nEngineers can write when you know it has \naccess to \nthe entire internet's worth of knowledge \num and all of that stuff right and so \nwhat becomes really interesting \nobviously when you have a system that \ncan write code right is then all you \nneed to do is give it an environment in \ntheory and I think this is why there's a \nlot of \nyou know conversation around safety and \nand \nall of this stuff right like AGI \num uh opinions on on some of those \nthings but I I think what's what's \nreally interesting is if you can have \nsomething that can write amazing code \nand then you can give it an environment \nwhere it can actually execute that code \nnow you actually do have this \nself-improving system that can in theory \num do anything and learn anything \nautonomously right you just have to kind \nof give it the right tools right so \nobviously there's there's been a lot of \nconversation a lot of thinking a lot of \num I would I would say it's still like \nin the early days most of the \ndefinitely the experiences and and the \nproducts and and a lot of the \ninfrastructure too is uh in its toy \nphase still \num like clearly people have have you \nknow awoken to the possibility so I \nwould just say the main thing with gpt4 \nfor me \num is the ability to write code and then \nI think taking you know one step back \num the the way that I I've described \nkind of this day and age \nto just you know somewhere because a lot \nof my friends are like hey \nI've been hearing about this like you \nknow GPT thing I'm seeing a lot of it \num I don't get it like what I mean it's \ncool right like I you know there's like \nwhat is it and \nand and the thing that I would say is \nyou have \nwhen the internet first you know really \nreached scale it made the cost of moving \ninformation \naffected the zero approach zero so the \ncost of distribution right and that's \nwhat enabled social media it's what \nenabled you know blogs and like kind of \nlike you know what people would call \nlike web2 right \num a lot of that stuff and I think what \nhas happened is now the cost of \ntransforming information has gone to \nzero um and that is like \nthat's that's that's really interesting \nobviously you know there are so many \nindustries that are purely just about \ntransforming information so many \nprofessions that are about you know just \ntransforming information I've I I've \nheard there's already legal you know \num legal and like you know legal \ncompanies and lawyers tend to be the \nlatest to adopt new technology \num but a lot of like you know \nparalegals Junior employees are actually \nbeing replaced by this technology even \nlike already today \num \nand you know you have anything that \ninvolves moving you know taking taking \nlike all these ETL pipelines elt \nanything that involves you know \npreviously would have required \narmies of Engineers and Engineering \nteams to both build and maintain a lot \nof that is now effectively free right so \nI think we're still grappling with the \nimplications of a lot of what that means \num and what that will mean all I know is \nI think things are gonna \nyou know get \nweird and we'll see yeah I definitely \nwant to come back to that kind of like \nETL data ingestion topic but I think \nthat idea to stay on that idea of how it \ncan write code a little more it's been \nabsolutely mind-blowing the ability of \nit like when we had Harrison Chase from \nLang chain on we were talking a lot \nabout uh and also Bob and light at the \nCEO of weba we're talking about like the \nthe way that it could maintain software \nlike you could see the errors and kind \nof maintain the software and just the \ngeneral idea of you know writing some \ncode executing it seeing the output and \nthen chaining that to you know keep \nwriting code better yeah it is yeah so \nand and then um I guess kind of one \ntopic I want to come on in that writing \ncode sense is like so as I've been \ntrying to adopt it in my life I'm mostly \ndealing with these big code repositories \nso I'm thinking a lot about like how \nwould the like the leviate code base \nwhich is even bigger than 25 000 tokens \nlike how do I get get it to navigate \nthis kind of thing this one I think a \nlot of these ideas yeah like blank chain \nllama index on how do you \nknow exactly and I think this is like \nwhere we're embedding uh you know really \nplays a role too right I think also the \nwhole world was kind of awoken too and \nsince embeddings over the past six \nmonths \num you know we we've been building \num we actually started building on \nembeddings pipelines before we did \nactually any better stuff and this was \nback in December of 2021. \num and this was you know back when the \nthe best available generative model was \nDaVinci II uh and it was at that it was \nat that point where it was like \ninteresting but not actually useful \num you know reliably useful yet but the \nembeddings models were were obviously \nyou know fascinating right because it in \nmany ways it wiped away you know years \nof compounding advantages that many \nsearch companies had right that they \ndeveloped like these you know \nproprietary technology just for search \nand then you know I think \nin a lot of ways a lot of that is \nbecoming commoditized right with \nembeddings whether it's search \nrecommendation systems \num yeah I mean there's obviously still a \nton of challenges building you know on \nembeddings with with each of those but \nyeah amazing and far easier than before \nyeah I think so obviously with the weave \npodcast the topic of embeddings is like \nthe number one thing I want to talk to \nyou about and I'm so excited about like \nI think I figured \nyeah so so with the to come back into \nthe design of mem I'm very curious about \nlike how you think about kind of like \nchunking up all the units in that go \ninto the Knowledge Management and you \nknow embedding it yeah \nyeah I mean there's you know I think \nhere's the really interesting thing \nthere's there's \nI think currently the primary school of \nfun \num where most people are is you just \nhave this what I call like this like \nblob of vectors \num \nyou have you know Vector index you you \nvectorize any piece of information as \nlong as you can represent it in text \nalthough with multimodal models now you \nknow \num I started to make an appearance I \nthink that's going to be really \ninteresting as well but before before we \ngo into that \num and then you just dump it all in \nthere and then you do a nearest neighbor \nsearch right and then you find the you \nknow those things \num and I think that works for a lot of \nthe use cases that we can think about \nimmediately and can think about now and \na lot of like the search use cases that \nactually already exist \num in the world \num \nbut what happens is you quickly start \nlike for for any like real \nuse cases that \num are are deeper you quickly start to \nrun into the limitations of basically \njust this like one shot nearest \nneighbors like you know that's what I \nget right \num and you run into that pretty quickly \nand I think one of the things that we \nrealized and this is \nthis is essentially like you know how \nhow we I think how we think about \nbuilding our infrastructure you know \ndifferently is embeddings are a key \npiece of the puzzle \num but ultimately you also do need \nstructured knowledge underlying it so \nit's like you have embeddings that \noverlay \nin our case it's a structured Knowledge \nGraph right that we also use language \nmodels to build \num right so it's kind of like imagine \nthis you know database this actual \ndatabase \num like you know SQL database that \nyou're reading and writing to right \nreading from and writing to and then you \nlayer on embeddings on top of that and \nnow you can do things instead of just \nlike these one Shadow find you know the \nnearest neighbors you can actually do \ndeterministic you know multi-hop queries \nthat require knowledge of you know \nmultiple different things all at the \nsame time a lot of the things that you \nknow I think \num things like Lang chain right also \nlike thinks about right \num but if you think about you know \nit and I think this is all like you know \ndeveloping but if you think about \nsomething like Lang chain \num obviously one of the issues with it \nis because everything runs sequentially \nyou know a it's \nexpensive but I think that's you know \ngoing to become less and less of an \nissue \num but uh latency wise it's expensive \nright \num so but imagine if you could actually \nconvert a user input whatever that is \nright into a set of deterministic graph \nreads right or you know database reads \nthat we know are fast \nright \num and and then retrieve information \nthat way and then you \num \nyou know blend that actually with like a \nhybrid index using a netting I think \nthat's a lot of where uh where the world \nwill actually head long term \nyeah that idea of like question \ndecomposition like are follow-up \nquestions needed um I don't know if I'm \ngonna remember this off the top of my \nhead but it's like did Einstein use a \nlaptop \nlike yeah yeah so you break it into the \ntwo questions to assemble it and yeah \nand that and there's kind of in the \nbeginning of as I was listening I \nthought we're kind of getting into like \nthe adding structure to Vector search \nand this topic I think is so fascinating \nespecially when you're adding the large \nlanguage model controller on top of this \nyeah a lot of yeah like a lot of kind of \nleviating the vector databases having \nsupport for the symbolic filters as well \nas the hsw the vector index and you know \nlike things like in our 118 edian talked \nabout the bitmap index the speed of and \nall these kind of things and yeah \ndata structures right yeah that yeah \nthat involve embeddings but it's not \njust this like single flat blob uh yeah \nyeah and so I'm so curious about this \nactually there's nothing I'm talking \nwith Harrison about privately is like \nhow do the large language models \ninterface with these symbolic filters \nhave you thought about this yeah yeah I \nmean so I think this is actually why \nthe fact that it can write code this is \nreally in right right accurate code \num really comes into play right because \nnow you can actually imagine you define \na data structure you define a certain \nKnowledge Graph \num then you can you can have the \nlanguage models you can teach the \nlanguage models right so to speak to \nknow how to interface with it and to \nknow how to query from it and to know \nhow to write to it \num and you kind of take \nthat whole process that would have been \nyou know teams of Engineers for each you \nknow each Pipeline and each \ntransformation before \num into just like hey \nyeah so when Chad gbt first came out uh \nBob had showed me this thing he's like \nhe shows me his prompt sequence and he's \nhaving it write Json like it populates \nthe Json dictionary so it's compatible \nto the next API call and all that was so \nfascinating um so yes I think that was a \na really great top coverage of like the \ngbc4 and I I really want to kind of \ntransition to this next topic this is a \npretty big one which is the kind of \nfine-tuning models versus a zero shot \ndebate and I'm curious especially with \nyeah \num so so my my take on this \num has been pretty \nyeah so so here's my take \num I think it's clear we're at some \npoint in the S curve of the capabilities \nof these language models I really don't \nknow where we are on the s-curve are we \nnear the end are we you know towards the \nbeginning if I had to guess I would say \nthere's no reason to believe that we're \nanywhere close to the to the top of it \nand that we're probably likely very much \nstill in like the steepest part right \nand I think when we are in that scenario \nand and if we if we just play back what \nhas happened over the last you know 12 \nto 18 months and we assume that you know \nuh things will continue in in that way \nthen what's happening is every six \nmonths literally every six months \nthere is a step change in capabilities \nand so \ndepending on what you're fine-tuning a \nmodel for my my opinion is if you're \nfine-tuning a model to improve its \nGeneral capabilities \nyou know with some piece you know of \nyour own data or whatever that is \nI think that's totally not worth it \nright now because I think what's going \nto happen is the next model is going to \ncome out it's not only going to be \ncheaper it's going to be way faster \nright \num and it's going to be way better and \nall of the time and effort you spent in \nactually figuring out how to fine-tune \nthat model we'll go to waste except \nexcept and I think you know it's an \nimportant question to ask like what will \nnot change \num and this is really you know once we \ndo get to the top of the S curve in \nprogress you know slows when we no \nlonger have a new state-of-the-art every \nsix months you know it takes longer \num the actual \nthen at that point I think fine-tuning \nsqueeze the you know the additional 20 \nor 30 percent you know out of out of \nthese models becomes actually really \nuseful and the question the important \nquestion to ask right is like what do \nyou need by that point in time like what \nis the thing you need to act what is the \nasset you need to build over the course \nof that time in order to be able to do \nthat and obviously you know it comes \ndown to you know one way or another some \nform of data right \num and you know even that's obviously \nit's a loaded term in terms of like how \nyou you know what is actually useful \ndata what it's not but \num you know depending on how you define \nit at the end of the day it's the data \nis useful the actual time spent in in \nfiguring out how to tune these models or \neven taken \nyou know off-the-shelf open source model \nto you know try to you know do something \nwith that to squeeze whether it's \nlatency or performance out of it I think \na lot of the time doesn't actually make \nsense \num \nI think that the difference is \num \nif you take something like a \nlike a llama you know with alpaca right \nI don't know if you saw that that came \nout of Stanford \num obviously that's very interesting \nbecause now you can have things that \nactually just purely run on the edge \nright you know run exclusively on your \nphone and that unlocks a whole new set \nof capabilities \num that previously wasn't possible right \nbut if what you're trying to do is \nreplicate a set of capabilities \n[Music] \num at least we \nwe wish I away from \nfrom fine-tuning for that purpose we do \nwe do actually do a lot of fine tuning \num but that's primarily to make \num \nthe the reason we do it is to \nuh basically get a smaller model to do \nthe job of a larger model \nat lower latencies and that will just \nyou know obviously that data set \ncontinues to scale \num as you know as as new models uh as \nmodels improve and stuff \nyeah I thought you said a lot of \ninteresting ideas um I think to quickly \nI really like that s-curve thing you \ndescribe with this step function if it's \ndoubling every six months it doesn't \nmake sense to put the effort into it and \nBob started to be referencing you so \nmuch in this podcast but he he was \nrecently on uh coheres uh Twitter they \nhad a talk where he said that basically \nhe thinks that like 80 of these cases \nthe zero shot model combined in a hybrid \nsearch with like bm25 lexical search \nthat will cover most of these search \ncases totally yeah it's not completely \nagree with you but I really want to come \nthere are two more topics that you \nmentioned that I think are so \ninteresting the Llama Alpac alpaca thing \nwhere it's like you know it is related \nto the next topic of distillation where \nyou're trying to get the large model \ncompressed into a smaller model but um \nit gets I I think the reason the alpaca \nthing is so exciting is because people \nare like running it on their phones \nright like uh or yeah yeah yeah yeah \nand it's like the idea of I think when \num when GP T when DaVinci 3 came out it \nwas something like two cents per thous I \ndon't know the exact price and like it \nwas it was more it was six cents per \nthousand yeah it was it was pretty \nexpensive to generate a lot of text so \nthe thinking was like uh you got to be \nso careful about how you do it but now \nas it's trending towards zero it's like \nthese language models could have like \nthese massive conversations with \nthemselves and as I think about mem I \nthink about this idea of you know I \ncreate a a workspace where I put \neverything I know about contrast of \nrepresentation learning and then I just \nhave the language models talk to each \nother about like sample a paragraph \nsample paragraph and then build new \nknowledge over time and yeah exactly \ntotally yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah \nyeah and that idea I think is incredible \nso so I I do want to come back to the \ndistillation thing um maybe \nmaybe one topic to begin is I'm very \ncurious about these kind of like ranking \nmodels so like the large language model \ncould of course rank these documents \nwith very high Precision like if you \nhave the query and then you have the top \n10 it could give you a really great \nranking uh so it is maybe I don't I \ndon't know if it's like prying too much \ninto exactly how the sausage is made but \nlike how what kind of tasks are you \nthinking of distilling from large \nlanguage models \nyeah um \nso there's there's that's one of them uh \nwhat you just mentioned \num you know historically I think in \nsearch it's been called like a cross \nencoder \num and I think there's still a lot of \nvalue and you know cross encoders but \nyou can actually spin up like a a \npurpose-built Crossing coder really \neasily actually using you know kind of \nlike a smaller uh you know one of these \nmodels right \num and then you know it returns a lot of \nprobs you can do interesting kind of \nmath on top of that \num a lot of interesting things there but \nthere's there's a lot of things where \nyeah uh I'll give you one example you \nknow someone says something \num to their assistant right to their \nmental system like hey do this for me or \nyou know XYZ \num but it's it's kind of you know if we \nthink about the assistant like as a \nperson it's kind of unpredictable what \nyou say to a person \num and what you say might have different \nintents sometimes \num what you the even within you know \nthis is a huge problem within search \nobviously like search intent like is it \nis this a a keyword based intent right \nor is this like hey is this a vector \nintent and then yeah you like you know \nrank different things differently uh \nmaybe you even uh and this is a lot of \nour Explorations is \num what if you could create Dynamic uis \nright because depending on what the \nperson is asking you depending on what \nthe person is doing \num there's actually totally a different \nrepresentation of the information that \nis useful and valuable \num but you know being able to even just \nlike classify the intent of the message \nlet's say \num obviously you use the the most \nimportant use gpd4 on that and it's \nit's going to get it right like almost \nyou know every time assuming you also \ngive it enough contacts and all that \nstuff but it's slow it's slow it's \nexpensive and you're actually really run \nit on their bigquery right and so when \nyou when you have a \ntask like that that usually experience \nokay you know fine tune is actually \nvaluable right particularly when latency \nand or cost is the issue and you're okay \nwith \ncausing you know brain damage to the \nlanguage model and being okay with them \nfor getting everything else and only \nbeing able to do this thing right \nbecause then you can take a much much \nsmaller model \num to you know much yeah yeah to \nbasically just do that one specific task \nright and then there's also like you \nknow ways where you can \nuse those models to generate training \ndata for the smaller models and it gets \nreally gets really meta but yeah \nyeah that last one's my absolute \nfavorite idea I mean when you said the \num the brain damage thing that \ninterrupted my I love that topic so much \nthat like because you when you fine tune \nit this like catastrophic forgetting how \nthe robustness of it is gone now and \nyeah but it's very good at one thing \nyeah yeah yeah \nI kind of well I I do want to stay on \nthe ranking thing just a little there's \none question I have for you especially \nas you know product focus with the mem \nthing is is this latency constraint and \nhow you think about because the cross \nencoder is really slow compared to you \nknow Vector yeah yeah yeah well I think \nthere's a lot of things \num I think a lot of the Innovation \nthat's going to happen over the next \nyear is going to be on the ux side \num you know internally we call this like \naiux which obviously you know what that \nmeans \num but it's you know to give you one \nnaive example you look at what Bing does \nright where you type something in and \nit's showing you some of the work that \nit's doing right \num I also saw this like in the stripe \nllm like for their documentation thing \nthey did some really interesting kind of \nlike front-end animations where first \nthey would \num because well they actually mirrored \nthe steps of what happens right first \nthey would retrieve a list of documents \nthey would show you those documents \nfirst and then when the answer would \nactually come in it would push those \ndocuments down and as you know it kind \nof tricks you into thinking oh actually \nthis is fast right because something is \nhappening all the time \num and I think there's like there's a \nlot of those tricks you can play you \nknow kind of uh there and then there's \nseparately \num and this is where I think you know \nreally having a structured Knowledge \nGraph in our case uh comes into play \num \nthere's a like if you think about most \nof like what makes search Fast right in \nsearch indexes \nuh it's just it's pre-processing \num so if you actually have \nthe data in a structured way such that \nyou can pre-process it \num you know into useful indices \nthat's another way to to make sure that \ncertain things that you need to be fast \nare fast so you know that that little \nthe the knowledge graph topic is a funny \none because with weavia it's not like \nrdf technology with these two full yeah \nI'd rather talk about hsw but that is \nvery interesting the knowledge graph \nlike does mem use things like neo4java \nor like tiger graph those kind of things \nas well \nno we we actually just we we build all \nof it on top of postgres \nyeah I also saw this thing with uh with \nllama index it's they call it like graph \ngbt where you could just kind of do like \none query it's just like a client-side \nindex yeah yeah like take a thou take a \nthousand search results and they'll \nbuild a knowledge graph in memory kind \nof \nyeah yeah yeah yeah yeah \nsuper cool so so maybe pivoting topics a \nbit I'm very curious about the earlier \nwe mentioned this idea of ETL data \ningestion to the kind of database part \nof it and um so yeah I'm really curious \nabout like I I find this like memet \nTwitter thing to be such a fascinating \nintegration with how you flow data from \nTwitter into your knowledge management \nand then yeah so I'm very curious like \nyou know obviously open ai's whisper has \nunlocked like a massive ETL now people \ncan take YouTube videos podcasts and \njust you know do it like that uh and \nthen gbt4 I so I'm also talking with \nBrian from unstructured about hopefully \ngetting him on the podcast as well and \nuh like gbt4 the ability of it to do OCR \nright images yeah yeah yeah yeah well I \nI wouldn't even call that OCR \num \nbecause \nit's um \nat least the way I think about OCR is it \njust gives you kind of like a snapshot \nrepresentation back right \num this is kind of it's more like \nactually \nit's it's as if like a human could read \nthe thing and uh you could you could ask \nquestions based on it and they're just \num Works kind of through this like \nlanguage model right it's it's um so \nit's it's it's \nthe the idea of multimodal like the \nencoder being able to actually \ncreate a representation \num that is shared between texts and \nimages and audio and you know video \nbecause if you think about kind of like \nwhat people are doing today you know \nthis is another thing that I think is \ngoing to become obsolete pretty quickly \nwith whisper is people are doing that on \nYouTube videos right \num and you know it makes sense but you \nend up losing so much information \nbecause you have you capture none of the \nthe visuals right \num and so much of YouTube videos is the \nvisuals so \num you know you could \ntranscribe and then you could try to \nstitch together the frames right from \nyou know the the actual visuals \num but if you could actually just go \ndirectly from an mp4 file format into \nthe embedding that actually \nis in the same space as you know your \ntext embeddings \num \nthat's where things get really really \ncool \nand obviously I think that's that's the \nfuture right so \nyeah I think we just saw uh runways is \nit called Gen 2 I'm sorry if I messed up \nthe name but the this video generation \ngenerally the idea of processing videos \nso I my kind of funny story with this is \nwhen I first started doing deep learning \nI was a basketball player coming to grad \nschool after basketball and after a \nfailed basketball career and so I was \nlike okay how do I build a deep learning \nsoftware app for basketball and I had \nthis idea yeah you could probably \nextract all the highlights from the \ngames using like confidence yeah that \nworks but the problem with that like one \nthing one problem of quite a few \nproblems but like the image data video \ndata it's so high dimensional the idea \nof like compressing a minute video into \nuh let's say 1500 dimensional Vector do \nyou think that kind of like will need to \nbe more clever about how we're doing it \nyeah \nI think I think that's an issue I I \nso one of the things I learned about \nmaybe maybe this was Llama Or maybe this \nis something else \num \nmaybe it was llama but I think one of \nlike the fundamental Innovations was it \nmade it uh \nit it turned it from you know 16-bit \num \nlike values right per Vector to \num to four bit values right and so it \nchanged kind of like the the \ngranularity of of what could be \nrepresented to basically just like eight \nvalues right between negative one and \none \num and that's really how they managed to \nget something so small \num and yet it \nkind of keeps a lot of the performance \nso I think \nI think there's some really interesting \nyou know kind of compression techniques \nthat were just at like the very \nbeginning of of discovering so \num \nyeah I I'm I I have a feeling we'll be \nable to get to that uh pretty soon \nyeah that's fascinating I love that you \nbrought that up but one of the big \nfeatures new features of weave in 1.18 \nis adding product quantization where \nlike you say we quantize the vector \nvalues from 32 bits that or well exactly \nyeah yeah there's there's like a couple \nparts to it but I think something about \nquantization there's kind of like two at \nfirst there was this thing called binary \npassage retrieval where you sort of \noptimize the contrastive models with \nthat tan H Activation so it's kind of \nzero one naturally and then you have \nthis kind of binary Vector that's longer \nbut captures information I I think like \nquantization aware training is another \nthing that hasn't been realized as much \nbecause if you put it in like instead of \nproducing the vectors and now we're \ngoing to run k-means tile encoder on the \nvectors maybe if you put that into the \noptimization it's like one of these \ninteresting kind of yeah fine tuning \nmaybe there's something to like a \nhierarchical structure all these kind of \nyeah \nthis kind of idea of how do we like one \nof my favorite topics in weave Vector \ndatabase is like how do you have a like \nthere's we've done like a billion scale \nthing with like you know like sphere \nwhich is kind of like copying the \ninternet and doing that kind of thing \nbut yeah the videos and all that so \nmaybe kind of even \ncontinuing on the kind of multimodal I \nguess I don't know if this topic is too \nout there for these kind of things but \nlike are you interested in these recent \nadvances in robotics and say things like \nsay can rt1 do you think that will have \nsome kind of role in this as well \nuh I've been Loosely following it but \nhonestly I haven't been closely \nfollowing enough to be able to say \nanything insightful yeah sorry I think \nthat was maybe too tangential the topic \nI actually one thing I think is really \ninteresting with the Knowledge \nManagement thing is like the biomedical \nthing let's actually dip into that topic \nso I think these kind of knowledge \ngraphs like this idea of having \nstructure and unstructured like just \nthese like you know drug drug protein \ndrug like Gene protein interactions and \nthis kind of graph structure right I \nthink it's like the one example of a \ncitation is this paper called Prime kg \nfrom Harvard from the biomedical \ninformatics and it's it like if people \nare out there looking for like an \nexample of what I'm talking about prime \nkg is like the best one I know of and \nit's like this kind of way like I I \nwonder if like with this knowledge \nmanagement software like mem do you \nthink you would have like your genome \nyour proteome in a in like your \nnote-taking software \nthat I mean that's that's basically the \num yeah that that's basically the vision \nright which is you know really we \nstarted with notes and I think over the \ncourse of this year it's going to become \npretty clear to people as uh with some \nof the new releases that we have coming \ncoming out that \num like notes are just kind of one \ncomponent of the type of information \nthat you can capture uh and so you know \nwe're building a ton of \nuh pipelines right from like manual data \nsyncing uh or sorry automatic data \nsyncing of you know your email for you \nknow your calendar like slack messages \nall of that stuff right to the one time \nhey I have this PDF I have this video I \nhave this thing \num you know and kind of like drag and \ndrop in right uh into that so really \nyeah the idea is how do we create this \nUniversal Knowledge Graph that \nrepresents your entire world of \ninformation \num and then how do we give you the power \nof actually being able to hold that in \nyour hands right because I think if you \nthink about it in the past \nthat's been held in the hands of \nadvertisers who then use that to Target \nus for that right but if you could carry \naround you know one thing that I think \nthis is on our blog too but that we've \nthought about is \nyou know you can imagine \nyou sign into Netflix or new flicks \nright with men \num you know in in 2024 and \nyour experience is automatically this \nperson is for you right and today you \nsigned with you know whatever you said \nwith Google or something with all that \nstuff \nand you know nothing happens you just \nmanage to sign it \num but if we could actually build that \npersonal Knowledge Graph \num \nthen it becomes really interesting so \nyeah I think that's exactly what you've \nunlocked with mem and in this kind of \nlike you have an embedding of you that \nyou take everywhere that comes from all \nsorts of things like me from the YouTube \nvideos I like are now synced up with the \nAmazon things I'm buying and nothing \nyeah yeah but yeah I'm also very curious \nlike how you think about like privacy \npreserving AI yep \nlike is do you use things like Federated \nlearning do these kind of topics come up \nuh I mean I think it's it's one of those \nthings that obviously we're we're super \num \naware of on on at least kind of the \nresearch side \num I think \nthe obviously the topic is super \nfascinating right like being able to \nactually \nyou know run inference on \num on encrypted data right would be \nwould be kind of the dream unfortunately \nit's it's not really possible right now \num I think everything that uh uh it's \nit's all you know basically that the the \nviability level of you know being \nresearch projects right so \num eventually I think that's that is \nwhere the world is is gonna head though \num you know whether it happens in 2025 \n2030 \nuh you know 2035 that's that's to be \ndetermined but \nyeah amazing well Dennis thank you so \nmuch for this tour of these technical \ntopics about you're so knowledgeable \nabout this and this was such a fun \nconversation \num maybe to kind of wrap things up could \nyou talk about like kind of your \nexperience founding this company like \nhow's it been it's super successful and \nall that and \nwell I I mean I feel like we're at just \nthe very beginning of the journey \num I mean especially you know given what \nthe kind of the the the vision is for \nyou know the end products if there even \nis is this idea of an end product right \nbut \num yeah it's I think it's been \nyou know I would say one of the things \nthat's been really interesting for us is \nfrom the very beginning we kind of knew \nthat \num this was the vision this idea of you \nknow how do I build this like \npersonalized Knowledge Graph that I can \ntake with me anywhere \num and I think when you have that you \nknow \nin mind at the very beginning \num I think it's a lot of us to be a lot \nmore \num I think patient right and make \ncertain Investments That for example in \nthe knowledge graph right because that's \none of those things where actually \nbuilding this structured Knowledge Graph \nthat you know and then teaching language \nmodels to know how to interact with it \num is is is quite the build right it's \nit's very complex \nworking with a lot of evolving \nTechnologies kind of all at the same \ntime \num but having you know just knowing that \nhey that's this is we have to do it \nbecause this is this is why we started \nthe company this is why we're doing it \nuh I think has been \num you know one of those things uh that \nhave you know made us pretty unique in \nterms of how I think most startups \noperate so \num that's been you know it's been a \nreally interesting part of the journey \nobviously in the middle \nuh it's been you know around three years \nso far in the middle of the journey is \nwhen gpt3 really became a thing \num and it totally \num I still remember this like \nthis happy hour that we had and this is \nduring covet and we had these virtual \nhappy hours and one of them was just \nlike when it was when the first you know \nDa Vinci one first came out and we just \nlike sat on you know in the playground \nhe's playing with it uh you know because \nI got I got access to it like oh this is \nthis is kind of interesting this is you \nknow this is really cool \num and just seeing this Evolution and \nthis you know this revolution happened \nover the course \num you know like of this company \ndeveloping and realizing kind of \njust how much of an unlock it is for a \nlot of the things that we were doing \num as has truly been a sight to behold \nright so you know I \ncouldn't be more exciting \nto to be building what you know what \nwe're building right now so \namazing yeah and I'm I'm also so excited \nto see we're building and Dennis thank \nyou so much for joining the weba podcast \nand contributing all this knowledge has \nbeen so interesting to be talking with \nyou so thank you so much \nthank you \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Dennis Xu on Mem and LLMs! - Weaviate Podcast #41", "path": "", "link":
