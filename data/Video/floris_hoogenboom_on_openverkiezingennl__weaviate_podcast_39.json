{"text": "Check out the website here! https://openverkiezingen.nl/ Chapters 0:00 Intro 2:35 Developer Experience with Weaviate 4:12 ... \nhey everyone we have a pretty unique episode of the wevia podcast today we welcome Flores hoogenboom who's built this website using weeviate that organizes information about the Dutch elections so you ask it questions like say Highway construction and it uses the semantic search technology with additional filters across the different parties and overall this is a super interesting technology and in the podcast we're going to discuss all things from the technical details of how this is constructed the use of leviate semantic search embeddings as well as technology like summarization with chat gbt and multilingual you know processing Dutch Tech so I really hope you enjoy the podcast we also conclude with some discussions around bias especially important for applications like this so I hope you enjoyed this podcast and I really hope you check out the website especially if you're in the Netherlands thanks so much for watching hey everyone thank you so much for watching another episode of the weeva podcast I'm super excited to welcome Flores to the podcast Flores is building something super interesting with weaviate and a pretty novel application of alleviate so florist thank you so much for joining the podcast yeah nice to be here Connor uh love it awesome so can you dive right into it and tell us about uh your project of alleviate yeah sure um so this is something that already um uh was on my mind and a few other uh open source Fanatics with me uh for a couple of years of doing something um around parliamentary elections um and data or AI um and usually every year we had that idea a month before the election started that we thought debit again too late but this time we were we were in time and what we have been working on um is basically a tool that allows users to explore um party manifestos of the the the the the the political parties in the tax parliamentary elections um and we do it basically in a third of two stage first of all we allow them to explore so find out what's in there but I don't know about you did you ever read party manifestos yeah in the US it's a bit different but it's a lot of text uh no me personally now for me and I'm even though uh quite political information in that sense um because it's just too much text and too much text to make sense of so what we do on top of that is not only allow searching for those party manifestos but also allows summarization um so okay you type in a statement I think that um the Netherlands should invest more in artificial intelligence of course I do um um and it will give you a summary of what each party thinks about that statement you just entered hmm yeah that's super cool the use of the summary thing is so interesting as well and um so so I'm very curious about just the kind of sort of maybe we could start with the technical requirements like the kind of developer experience of getting the data into weeviate and like kind of what your experience with that part of it was yeah sure yeah so so uh I met Bob um from my uh daytime profession basically a couple of years ago uh I think way before the investment that you guys had um and it was always on my mind I want to do something with this software and uh for me it um it really started during Christmas playing around for a little bit exploring the RPM um and um basically it was pretty smooth actually um getting it up and running with uh with the docker files uh or the docker compose setup uh you guys provided um um and basically from that just build out this idea and once we get to a point where we thought hey this this might is gonna work uh I reached out to Bob like hey can we do a collaboration on this because this is this is cool this is helping democracy this is a AI for good basically um and then which should we aviate Cloud serves and it was actually a pretty smooth process in In from from a developer's perspective it was pretty hands-off uh we started locally with a nice local setup and once we had the re-av8 cloud service our production setup basically was just uh uh uh yeah it it was just changing URLs and tokens basically super amazing it's something else I'm really curious with this application is like how do you feel about the performance of the embedding models like when you're doing are you how are you evaluating the quality of the search what does that kind of thing look like yeah so that that it it is of course um a tricky topic to apply AI in it um and um we have banished all over the websites indicating hey this might be wrong and this is not contended as an advice for you guys to which where what you should vote it's only intended to show hey AI in the future might also play a role in this uh so we're not trying to replace um any parties you have in the Netherlands for example like that's basically the site which prep statements then allows you to um to answer to answer your own position on the statement that gives you an advice for us it's really about showing what AI can do if you look at the embeddings um we we think the quality is is quite good um we noticed a few things um we're doing this in Dutch so most of the Corpus isn't trained on that language of course still works out pretty decent uh abbreviations Etc that's where it becomes a bit difficult but what we also did is um we don't we we ask users to help us a bit and what we do in that sense is when you enter a statement we find the three nearest paragraphs in uh in Vector space and then we ask you as a user hey we think your answer might be in one of those in one of those chapters which one do you think matches best and with that two-stage approach um we've been able to get pretty decent results there so is that two-stage approach like maybe uh because we have this we've been thinking about this idea around like we've made in this other technology called gbt index where they have like a hierarchical summary so are you first searching through a summary of so I imagine these are these long uh like long statements of uh party preferences and so you first have these summaries and then which summary you like that takes you then into the document where you then find a more fine-grained particular to the party is that a correct understanding or no no it's it's it's way simpler than that in that sense so we we just indexed the um the sections of uh so each paragraph of the uh of the party manifestos that's also where we evaluate embedding zone so your short statement the embedding of that and the paragraph but what we do is we don't Reserve return a single result and then say hey this is it but we prompt the user okay we found three results which because if you look at this party manifestos if they talk about for example trade agreements yet it might be about trade agreements within the European Union that might be about trade agree agreements with the US that might be about brexit um so there's there's a lot of new ones there um and that's why we thought okay we won't return a single answer but rather we return them to three most relevant chapters and then let the user figure out okay based on the title of that chapter I think that this is the one which will answer my statement and um that that also means we we have to use to help the system a bit to figure out the right uh the right answer very cool so it's like um it's like the user interface is designed in a way to collect the data and um yeah so I guess I was a little confused on kind of the understanding the two-stage process of that so once you click it what it then takes you into the full article so sort of like uh like a web URL in a way yeah so so what happens is you enter your statement um then you say okay I wanna I I want to know what this party so take for example the the uh the the Democratic uh party in the Netherlands uh um um uh what what does what does it think about this statement then we'll give you three options you'll select the chapter and from that it takes you into the full text that we indexed of that chapter um with references to where you can find it on the um on the party's website and on top of that we offer you the option then to um use a sort of chat gpt-like model and to summarize okay what does this piece of text say about my statement um uh super cool yeah so so that data from the first uh search query and then three results do you use that data to then compare models with each other or I'm just curious if that kind of interesting at the moment we don't and that's just purely because of lack of time because we have all kinds of interesting ideas also what you can do of course with this especially also those statements that we collect that's super interesting information to know hey what's what's going on in society basically which teams people find interesting so we collect statistics about each statement how often it has been searched there we also use we aviate of course because it's free text entry and if you search for the Netherlands should leave Europe or the Netherlands should you use to leave the European Union you probably probably mean the same although the former is effectual impossible but um we we then try also try to do some analytics on that by merging similar statements together CA which which are the themes that pop up which are the teams that people find interesting uh what are the parties that people are interested for in those in those teams so that is basically also the follow-up that we'll give to this after the election not only um helping people figure or yeah scroll through those programs a bit more but also get some insight into hey what's what's going on which are the big themes actually that people find interesting yeah it's amazing it reminded me of another Dutch uh scientist who came on the podcast was uh Martin grutendorf said I hope I've got that last name uh right uh and he has this tool called Bert topic that I think is super interesting with what you're just describing where what you do is you uh cluster all the statements in the vector space and then you have the vector clusters and then you do TF IDF on the Clusters to have the unique keywords to each of the Clusters so it would be like you know I don't want to start getting into the political topics yeah so a super interesting way of Discovery so another question with respect to Wavy that I was really curious to ask you about was the use of the symbolic filters so uh like as maybe to set this up like I've been playing around with this podcast search progress a project so like with our conversation right now I'm going to embed the transcript and put it in like search to it and you can have symbolic filters like uh you know where speaker equals uh you know Martin grutendors and then I can and then I ask my question with that symbolic filter uh do you so how are you thinking about like kind of the extra metadata that goes around the text and that kind of thinking I think for us that's super important so what we do is we store all paragraphs basically in in one big index but we also store that with the information like okay which party said that um what is the chapter the chapter here and we're thinking in the future maybe we want to enhance our shirts but also uh adding some some common themes like hey this is sort of keywords that we uh that we see there um but what we do is you if you retrieve information from a single party we do use those filters to only do the filter before search basically uh I think you guys call it um and we first filter okay which the party that we're interested in and subsequently we we then use the um the embedding index the vector index base need to figure out okay which paragraphs of this party are are interesting um so it does limit Us in for example um um we can't yet use the hybrid Church which combines sparse and and dense Vector search which would be I think an enormous performance improve Improvement for a lot of the things because um a lot of keywords that probably now aren't in the in the in the vocabulary of our embeddies or aren't that common in that sense like um uh in the in Dutch you got a abbreviation it's called Uh AOW which is uh for for pension uh basically uh and that is something yeah if you search up on it and you do the embedding just purely dense dense comparison you probably won't find it because it's it's so rare in that Corpus that those embeddings don't um don't really pick it up so we're still uh hoping that at a certain point we might be able to use the hybrid church so with dense search combined with filters uh because we think that we'll be uh we'll enable us to give way more relevant results than we're already doing now and maybe even get rid of that two-stage approach and everything you should still select their own uh paragraph there hmm yeah that's super cool that idea of like the thinking about how do you add the AOW token to a dense embedding model I find to be very interesting like whether you can just kind of add a new token to the vocabulary and just do a little bit of fine tuning on these uh you know on these texts and whether that can correct it but yeah the hybrid search and the hybrid search adding the wear filters the UVA 118 feature that I hope people are interested so so one other question I wanted to ask about and I've been thinking a lot about the role of like potentially cross encoder re-ranking weba where basically you search and then you have this high capacity scoring model that re-ranks the results but the trade-off is sort of speed and I'm curious like with your application how important do you think speed is to the user experience of search um um I I I I tend to say is super important but I think for for our application and the bottleneck also isn't um uh isn't we aviate because if you look at the size of our index um it's pretty small like the efforts part in Manifesto is I think 200 uh 200 Pages um embedding that in paragraph So I think that if we if we have um like 5 000 objects in in the effect space that that it's already a lot in that sense so the bottleneck for us is really Computing those embeddings [Music] um I I haven't tried we aviate on a uh on a larger uh section that's something that we're now thinking about is what would be really cool is if you can use this technology on uh not transcripts of this podcast it would also be pretty good cover but uh on transcripts of what happens in Parliament um what does your elected representative really say in Parliament after he's elected about the teams that are important and I think that is something where I even feel that that if you talk about AI for good AI helping democracy um that that I would love to see where this is going and then also explore how that how that index grows because that's way more data than we're prostitute now um because that takes out the role of of colored media basically and really makes it factual okay what what what what was said about this team not how did we frame it in the media with what was said about it and um I think that is an interesting role where this technology can help really for uh um yeah making democracy more transparent in that sense yeah it's a super a super impactful application I think and um yeah sort of this truthful thing inspired me to start thinking a little bit more about the idea of the chat qbt summarization and there's kind of this idea of like uh adding prompts that say please cite your sources or something like that so uh when you're you know you've come into the text and now you're using the summarization model do you how do you think about then citing the sources with the summary that's produced yeah so um it's it's something we've been debating a lot of whether we want the chat GPT summary in there or we would say well we we now just stick with finding the right paragraph because that's factual and the chat GPT is something that can go okay that can hallucinate a bit um we opted for doing it um mainly because our goal now is not um to have the most factual platform but rather to to Showcase hey at this moment the technology is not there but this is what AI will be doing for you in uh in the future so that's also how we communicate about this we'll we'll never say where we have 100 the right answer everything is filled with banners hey this might be wrong if you really want the true answer look look at the paragraph uh read it um um but it is something that we also put a lot of effort into in figuring out okay um what kind of prompt um do we ask uh chatibility there and something that we found out that works really nice nicely I think we've seen those examples of GPT going wrong and like okay what is um with those riddles basically um Bob's Brothers called uh blah blah blah and his mother is this and then GPT confidently giving the wrong answer but what was interesting if you ask jet GPT not to give you the answer but to give you the reasoning why why before you come up with those arms you generally get better results so that prompt engineering um where we ask Chachi hey what does this Source think about this statement and please cite the sentences that made you come to these conclusions and if there aren't any relevant sentences uh indicate that you can't give the answer that kind of prompts helped us to get this to a level where at least we think okay it's good enough for this demo um and um this is this is not not hard science yeah comparing this but in our in our tests um out of 100 statements we had one where we told hey this this might not be uh the proper uh proper result there um so not there yet but uh interesting to showcase there's a couple things that maybe quickly on the idea the prompting um one of the examples Erica recently published a lang chain review demo and one of the first examples was this uh you know it answers a question and then you follow up by taking the answer as input and saying what were the assumptions you made when answering this question and then like that is the input to based on these assumptions do you still agree with this answer and this kind of chaining and the ability of that particular way to reduce Hallucination is really interesting um but then you ended with saying something that really got my interest um so so you're looking at the summaries from cha gbt and annotating uh you know is this a hallucination yeah so so um and and we don't do this uh large scale yeah um but we thought before we feel confidently enough um to to put this out in the open basically if you want to have an idea of the quality so what we did we prepped a set of around 50 statements got the results from the whole chain um uh what what would be the output of that summary and then labeled that hey do we think this is uh okay or do we think this is completely uh uh completely off but once again that's really a qualitative answer to a very difficult question I think yeah I've been so I they have these kind of like quantitative abstractive summarization metrics like the Rouge score Blues score these are they're basically like engram overlap metrics compared to some ground truth summary of the things so in like let's say you're summarizing like a scientific paper you could use like the abstract is kind of like that ground truth and compare these metrics is there any kind of like ground truth summary from one of these statements that that and then I guess that would be one question but maybe the bigger question is from your use case perspective would those metrics be interesting to you as a way to kind of ablate the prompts ablate the chains ablate like the way that it's doing the summer yeah I I don't know enough about those metrics to really judge that uh I need to admit um but what would be very interesting for us and that's that's also something that we will be looking at into the future like like I said we have those election AIDS basically um which are tools that that people read through all those programs then position parties on um uh on on a set of statements do they agree with do they partially agree with it do they disagree with this um and they do that in a really scientific manner which is a sort of peer review the parties themselves review it and there's a lot of trust building that goes into uh into debt um what would be very interesting of course also once this technology progresses here um to seek a sort of a hybrid form between that um so where we've put a lot of effort into placing those parties knowing what they think knowing what the conclusion should be and this and more open-ended uh uh okay what what do we generate as those uh as those conclusions so that might be something for in Europe we have the European elections coming up uh next year which is by the way a very interesting case because they're still debating whether you can also vote for parties from other European countries um um and why that's interesting because they're also the language aspect compared to play of course but that might be something where at a certain point we hope that technology might have evolved then and where we can try things like this uh can try things like this out a bit more yeah the the language jump is something that I I think is an extremely emerging topic of this technology um like for example we've been working with coheres multilingual embedding models and these these are like really good embeddings for multilingual and uh yes I'm curious well maybe saying on the summarization thing do you like hugging face had this model called Bloom which was like a multilingual language model and I'm just curious if maybe in addition to chat gbt if you've tried some of these other large language models that maybe have been trained on Dutch and are done better at it no not not not yet and that would be really something that um if we would go that relative of that European elections uh by the time that would of course be very interesting to explore because then you get party manifestos that might be in French but German citizen can vote for a French party I've been I'm pretty sure he wants to know before he casts his vote on uh what's in that Manifesto then so then you're not only getting Dutch results in that sense but your your searching for a statement in Dutch or in German maybe you're getting a result in French that summarizing it again uh towards uh uh to work German or Dutch or whatever so I'm not sure about whether I would dare that with the current quality but it is an interesting Chain of Thought basically how this this can also help yeah make um uh make a lot of sources that aren't in your native language searchable and and easier easier to explore basically yeah so interesting and when I was talking to Nils rhymers from cohere about this he had mentioned that uh like one approach would be like you take the German and French and you translate it back to English and then and then you kind of can just have it all in English where like the model has you know but then he described that there are these things like um that then you get a very like U.S Centric view of the world like if you translate how do I do my taxes in Germany back to English it like doesn't really work like that so would you think about fine-tuning one of these language models on your uh on like a newer text there's another idea yeah yeah um it is something we now thought about of for for the these embeddings we didn't do that because sheer lack of time and uh resource uh basically um um [Music] but I'm not sure how that would work with with translations basically yeah um because I think that that's where the big challenge is um if you if you read political texts it's all about nuances it's it's it's not about the general theme but it's about the tone of voice in certain um and I think factual translation is one but also translating these things like okay how does this sound how does this feel uh which are pretty important actually for getting the meaning of uh of something yeah um yeah I'm I'm not sure if if the technology will be there uh will be there yet and if you would then do fine tuning then you need to have it translated party Manifesto there where you also won't probably have that reviewed so I think that that would be a lot of effort basically uh I'm not saying it can't be done I'm not saying it will not be done in the future but I don't think it's it's we're there yet yeah that's a that's a really interesting point you bring up on um like embeddings can capture different kinds of relationships so like the yeah like the factual relationship or the tone relationship think about it this a lot as well there's there are these papers that are coming out like task Square retrieval with instructions and instructor where basically the embeddings it like depends on the they like add intent it's almost like prompting for embeddings as well where you say like if you're searching for a stack Overflow like you might say I'm searching for another question compared to I'm searching for the answer directly but yeah this kind of like embeddings being able to capture different kinds of meanings uh but I guess I was actually curious about the idea of fine-tuning the language model rather than the embeddings um like like because I think with the summarization or like just the idea of continuing the language modeling on the Dutch text would that kind of thing sound like something that would be useful for this case like I'm thinking about trying to improve that summarization model yeah it might be it is something we thought about um um again uh did it didn't do it uh yet but uh if if somebody's listening who's who's happy to cook for a lot of volunteers to help this thing out um yeah I'm thinking about it what what it would what it would do um with basically doesn't it get too colored in that sense and that also it depends I think on how you how you train that what kind of um and if you look at those party manifesters they all have a very different tone uh in that sense but also the Corpus isn't that large so I'm I'm really curious okay will you get a sort of average political tone from from that um and what that would do with the readability of your summaries will they be very politically like long sentences uh hard to read Because what I like now and what's I think strength of this is that it also translates it to a pretty neutral language and I'm I'm curious will you keep that neutral language um if you would if you would fine-tune um and it depends on the extent the the the extent to which you fine tune but if you would find tune based on um um these manifestos maybe maybe if you would fine tune it based on manifestos and media coverage of the elections Etc I think that would be a more interesting concept to me like also take newspaper articles take what's written online take transcripts of um um of debates uh Etc if you collect a corpus like that I think this might this might work yes it's really inspired me to think about the whole like because the role of bias in language models is something that's brought up a lot and this application particularly seems pretty important for that and yeah I almost think like maybe the user interface like you type in a you know the question and then it should have like I don't know the view is like statement from each of the parties rather than like just like a ranked list how we're used to seeing search results but yeah how do you think about that kind of bias in this problem yeah I think it is a huge issue um I I don't think we have any idea to which extent uh that issue is is here so I think that's one of the big factors why why I also um everywhere I talk about this whether it's tomorrow will be on National radio basically and um uh everywhere I say this is not intended as an election advice this is intended to Showcase what the technology uh can do and will be able to do and in the future uh it might be uh uh might be a bit of advice we thought about collecting user feedback there okay um uh on okay what what what um how does this summary sound to you um um do you think this summary agrees with the view of the party that is stated but we were a bit afraid for um um basically data pollution there of people who enter a statement uh look it up for the party they will never vote on and then uh click no this is this is wrong this is wrong this is wrong not answering the question that was there but rather expressing their political opinion uh opinion there so we we didn't do that but would be really interesting to also have this in a sort of controlled setting where um we really have guidelines okay how how do we label these things here and um how do we identify bias but that's um there is something that takes away more or it takes away different expertise I think than only the tech expertise we have here but then also uh requires expertise from political sciences or for example a collaboration like I just mentioned with one of those election eight in the Netherlands that have a whole process of uh getting from these manifestos to uh positions on the on statement but it's it's really interesting to think about this uh going forward yeah for sure yeah I mean the the role of but I mean it yeah I really have two I don't have too much expertise on bias in the whole thing but yeah it's like there's obviously this amazing technology of you know we can now semantically search through all the everything written every conversation all that and then there's like the well is the search embeddings or the language but language model like bias towards one political view and therefore it's gonna kind of only match the results that match the underlying model and I think like kind of the you know the auditing tools that you know people like you who are building these applications I think all that will be really important so so yeah cool I mean it's but it is super exciting yeah yeah and it's also on how you define bias yeah because I sometimes have these discussions professionally like but bias free ml but basically the reason why certain ml works is because it's it's biased only it's biased on uh attributes we think it's okay to be biased all day it's it's it's it's it's it's biased on a certain feature it gives it the power so it's also a whole discussion like okay what what do we find acceptable there and if this for example would would be if the same bias as any newspaper um uh because I'm I'm not advocating here against all media absolutely not but every news Outlet of course has some form of bias in it um sometimes more profound than than other times um um but that's something we generally think is is okay or at least in certain parts of society agree on that that that is that is sort of yeah the representation of the truth so it's it's really interesting to think about okay um how does bias affect this and when when is that an issue uh in that sense but that's more societal discussion I think Dennis is a technological uh uh one to be honest yeah I definitely agree that it's like a hand-in-hand thing I think from the technology perspective I can maybe speak a little bit about uh machine learning there's this problem called class imbalance where you know just from the basic classifier sense if you're classifying cats and dogs and your data set is 80 dogs and 20 cats you know it's gonna it's gonna be really biased at predicting dogs and that's like and that's especially a problem with like you know like medical patient outcome prediction where it's like usually the patient survives but like sometimes they expire in the window and then you have this like bias so you use like you know Precision recall f-score metrics things like that but so like even in the contrastive learning and betting learning if most of the techs have this one political view it's more likely to match the query and the optimization objective and therefore it's less likely to like you know if you have this like radical new idea it's less likely to match that just because it's less likely in the training set just from the technical perspective that's how I can see that yeah yeah it's an interesting topic and it's it's a topic that um I I don't think we fully covered uh yeah that as a as a Tech Community but also as a as a society yeah what what do we find acceptable and I always make the example also of um if if people professionally talk to me about buyers in ml then I also always refer to the Dutch pension scheme where um everybody pays a certain the same amount and from us from a fixed age you get uh the same page but I pay the same amount as as women I'm not advocating that we should do this Liberty but just to illustrate how difficult it is although uh women have a a longer life expectancy of around three years so you might say well it's it's if you talk about fairness yeah is it is it fair that uh men statistically live shorter but hence relatively pay more for their pension scheme and I think this is something where we as Society say and ah it's not an issue and if probably people will be laughing at me now for for bringing this up but it's really about what do you define as buyers and what do you accept as as bias and unfairness Etc your algorithms rather than it is a technical discussion like how do we make um our features or tokenol or how do we make yeah that's that's a means to an end but that still then is okay what what do I accept as uh uh things where where it can be biased yeah it's I mean it's such an interesting uh application of the technology I can see like um you know like if we say like the extractive question answering models that classify the answer within the context that has a low risk of bias I think because it's kind of like grounded in it whereas like the Chachi BT to like summarize or like chat with you basically like the one application is you turn Chat obviously it is a chat bot to begin with and and you retrieve to have it supplement its context as you chat with it and it might probably like the political bias of chat gbt might come into play as it's reading that retrieved context and telling and speaking with you so I imagine that as well as I imagine just kind of search results in general sort of yeah I kind of like that idea of the user interface that takes you to each of the views rather than just like a ranked list just think about it for the first time but like that kind of way and yeah so florist is super interesting speaking with you you're working on a super interesting problem and it's such an exciting application the technology so thank you so much for joining the podcast and for you know discussing these ideas of them yeah cool let's uh led to be here and a nice talking Connor ", "type": "Video", "name":
