{"text": " \nforeign \n[Music] \nair we are super excited to uh have all \nof you here and it's something that I \nhaven't done in the first and the second \nedition and I kind of corner pointed it \nout so a big big thank you for taking \nthe time to listen to us either live or \nlater or especially if you do it once \nlive and then re-watch it because this \nis such an amazing show big big thank \nyou for uh for doing that uh and thank \nyou up front for asking any questions uh \nand and all of that because this is the \nthe beauty of um this episode of will be \nthere that this is a live show so I am \ngoing to encourage you to like please \nplease ask questions uh and don't \nnecessarily wait until the end of the \nsession \nif you can ask questions at any time and \nI can do this thing like I'm just now \nlike hiding and showing Banners at any \ntime I could actually pop up your \nquestion and say like hey Connor that \nwas like a really cool question for you \nor Zen I think I have something for you \nand that definitely I I really really \nencourage that uh for from all of you uh \nand then at the end we probably will do \na bit of a q a as well so if you know \nyou didn't feel very encouraged during \nthe session we'll probably do that and \nthen that's also something that Conor \npointed out like somebody actually \ntweeted at us uh saying like hey why \ndon't you do a q a like we want to do q \na that's why we are all live here \num a little warning I don't know how \nthis is going to go but right now me JP \nand Zen we are in Prague we came here \nfor a conference called devrocon so it's \nbasically a conference for a developer \nAdvocates like us uh which is the good \nside the bad side is that our internet \ncan cut out at any point so if suddenly \nI go like \nthis that means that I'm not being rude \nit's just like my internet went wrong or \nI'm just playing jokes on you so for now \nthat's it this is not happening so \nthat's enough about the intro and and I \nhave like uh we have like quite a few \nthings to show some of them are in \npreview not everything is super live \njust yet um but we we have a whole bunch \nof really cool things for you to observe \nand watch \num so this is really uh cool and then \nthat's a little message from Connor uh \nso we should be definitely uh doing that \nand that's how I can also show you a \nquestion so without any further Ado uh I \nthink we have JP scheduled to uh talk to \nus about \ndata importer JP take it away \nawesome thanks question yes um so \nhopefully my internet stays stable this \nwhole time but so far so good I'm just \ngoing to keep my fingers crossed during \nthe demo \num this POC some of you might have seen \nbefore this really came about while \nwe're on our location in Italy and in \nbetween all the team bonding and having \nlovely food and whatever \num we got to work on some cool projects \nand one of the things that um the \nmotivation for this for me was that \nbecause I'm new and I'm learning a lot \nin terms of what's we've yet and how do \nI you know uh just let all the wonderful \nthings you can do with it \num so for example trying different \nmodules and what have you I wanted to \ncome up with a way of quickly importing \nsome data because I'm repeating that \nprocess over and over and over again and \nmaybe trying different data sets right \nso the motivation behind this was how do \nI automate that process it's a little \nbit easier and repeatable and at the \nsame time you know automated sort of to \nlike press the same or come up with the \nsame schema over and over again and \nwhatnot \num so I ended up building a little uh \nproof of concept app based on streamlit \num Sebastian if you wouldn't mind \nsharing my screen I'll try and \nabsolutely so much thanks you're very \nkind \num so this is the um I just hacked this \nreadme file together so it doesn't \nactually look like that in real life but \nthat's the repo location \num that's where it lives it lives under \nmy username in GitHub \nbut yeah it's a fairly simple \num streamlit app and it's not really a \nlot of lines of code so if I have a look \nat uh \nit's um it looks like a lot of lines of \ncode but it's just still under like \ncouple hundred or okay under about 250 \nlines of code so it's not very much in \nterms of uh the volume and a lot of it \nis just kind of formatting and \num kind of making it presentable more \nthan the actual logic of what it does \nand to run this hooks to run this \num \nright and you basically need to have a \ncouple of packages open \num sorry again installed in your virtual \nenvironment and really the only uh \nlibraries you need a webiate client \nstreamlit and pandas obviously you need \npython it's a python app so you're going \nto need that \num so once you have these libraries \ninstalled in your poetry virtual \nenvironment or um kinda like I've got \nhere whatever all you would need to do \nis obviously need to clone the repo and \nyou need to get lfs enabled because \nthere's a data file that I've saved in \nusing gitmet.fs as well but you just \nsimply run uh streamlit \nI'm going to screw this up probably but \nlet's hope not \num dot pi \nand \nwhat it does is to open \nthe app and at this point I will have to \nstop sharing this screen and switch over \nto my other screen so I think I had to \nstop the screen and then present oops \nsorry \nthe excitement of live \num hey that's part of the game that's \npart of the game you know \ndrop out \nfantastic so that's what the app looks \nlike it's uh I tried to make it sort of \nas clean as possible and um uh it does \nreally have all the Hallmarks of a POC \napp because I added this really silly \njoke that doesn't even make a lot of \nsense about Wizards \num and in order to connect to a weeviate \ninstance I've got one running in the \nbackground \n[Music] \num \nlocalhost 80. \nyou just type in the address here in the \nURL and it'll connect and you'll see the \nsubsequent options underneath so you can \nhave a look at things like a schema and \nthere's nothing in there you'll get this \nlovely test message and I can see here \nand then there's a couple of options \nhere right so you can go to demo data \nsets and I've got a placeholder data \nI've got a couple of place or data sets \non the right hand side these are things \nthat you know I think would be \ninteresting to upload and I'll work on \nthat probably later but I've got this \nCorpus of wine reviews from kaggle and \nwhat you can do is set the number of \nobjects input so the default is set as \n500 but I can just make it you know 50. \num and just click import right and \nthat'll connect to the instance it does \nhave a predefined schema and upload the \ndata so if we scroll back up and go \nupdate database stats and expand that \nblog window below you'll can see the \nschema and some example objects \nso that's uh designed to streamline that \nprocess and if I have different modules \nenabled then what have you \num that you know I can try and see what \nmight or might not work and then start \nquerying it to see how those different \nvectors and different Vector space and \nvectorizers might change what happens \nthe other thing I've tried to hack \ntogether here is the ability to import \nyour own data \num uh I haven't got any data here so \nthat's on me but the idea here is that \nsorry I reset this repo and then when I \nre-download I realized I deleted my \nlocal data but you should be able to \nselect your local Json and CSV files and \nit'll Auto generate a schema based on \nthat it'll kind of give a best guess as \nto if it's uh \num if it looks like a bunch of integers \nfrom pandas it'll infer that and give it \nan integer \nalleviate file data type it would be an \nobject data type and whatnot and you \nshould be able to click just a few \nbuttons and import data that way as well \num and also um JP yeah sorry to \ninterrupt How brave do you feel because \nI could send you like a dummy data file \nuh to see if that works you're the trial \nyeah we could do let's let's how about \nwe Circle back to it and then \num I can try that while because I I \nguess the thing is on my phone I'll have \nto be downloading data and I don't know \nhow Keen people are to be like watching \nme download that off slack and then put \nit somewhere and then copy it but yeah \nlet's Circle back in it's a it's a two \nkilobyte file okay no excuse eight \nkilobytes apologies okay let's do it I'm \ndropping on \nslack \num it's a date like a handmade data set \nI've created because I'm playing with it \nso it'd be cool to see what happens \num do I get fired if it doesn't go live \nlike if it doesn't go well is this like \nthat \num not on live like we'll do it after \nthe call I like how non-committal you \nwere about this by the way you had to \nlike think about it for a long time \nwell you know like so here's the funny \nthing he is just like to behind that \nwall so like it's not like I have to go \nfire him I can go and Shout at him \nstraight up \nthat would be a first time right nope no \ndidn't work yeah so what I will say this \nis that your handwritten Json file is \nnot the way I expected it so that's \nthat's on you is um my take on this \nwhole thing \num so CSD csv's work better because I \nfound that when I was pausing json's \nsome of them were like nested by default \num when I paused it and yeah it was a \nbit tricky but csv's work work much \nbetter on that oh okay okay sounds good \nbut um the skeleton is kind of there and \nI'm planning on working on it when I get \nsome time uh to to say add a dummy image \ndata set and what have you and and the \nidea is that you know now you've got uh \nyou know we're able to populate the the \ninstance here just a you know a couple \nof seconds and if I'm making changes to \nthe instance and want to reset it and \nthen upload data I can just do that you \nknow reproducible consistent Manner and \nif you have your own data set you can \nstart from this and edit it and then you \ncan have your own interface and this \nworks with one of the WSS WCS instance \nas well so I won't go the same process \nagain because it's just going to be me \nclicking the same buttons but if you \nreplace this URL with I will do this \nthough \num I think it's called import tests and \nmy network \nit'll connect to that right then if I go \nupdate database stats now you can see \nit's gone back to an empty instance and \nI can do the same thing in upload data \nso yeah um that's what it is uh please \nfeel free to check it out and if you you \nknow find it useful I'd love to hear \nabout like how you would use it and if \nit's actually addressing any kind of \nlike you know problems or annoyances you \nhave in your Dev environment \ncool thanks JP and I think the intention \nof it as well is like it's not like this \nexact tool will become a production \nready specifically application but it's \nalso I think something that we are \nexperimenting with and the kind of \nthings we should have in the future once \nthe real data importer arrives uh it's \nnot like this is this isn't real this is \nstill real but like you know something \nthat we can we go like oh yeah uh we \nwill definitely put our name behind it \nyeah I mean like it is uh yeah for sure \nit's a real app but it's not too far \nfrom just the idea of the ephemeral idea \nof an app \num so it's it's it kind of does the job \nbut for sure \num yeah it's I'm not sure it's going to \nbe production ready in its current state \nbut \num hopefully it sort of gets the \nconversation going and gives you some \nideas about what might be useful down \nthe line \nyeah absolutely and I think that that \nfeedback for example on the ux of it or \nthe kind of features or maybe the kind \nof files that you may want to import \nlike JP was just saying oh I've tested \non CSV but like Json you know different \nthings may happen \num I know like I think we could be \nlooking at like the Json line files or \nor something so that kind of feedback is \nsuper useful as well so even if you just \nplay with it and then try it out and \nthen say Oh we work well for my scenario \nthat was so and so then that helps us \nbuild that like uh the big thing later \nyeah \nyeah I think so and the only thing you \nwould replace in this instance with \nyours would be the parser right for the \nfile and then once that's done it'll \nread the file correctly so yeah yeah \njust like Vivid it can be modularized \nright so if you then suddenly have like \na very specific file format right you \nmight be able to just like add that uh \nimporter right they not important but \nlike the file parser right yeah if you \nlook in the code \num the file Plaza is modular so if it \nsees a CSV it calls a particular \nfunction if it sees a Json it calls a \ndifferent function and you just replace \njust a few lines of code \num I got a little bit lazy with the CSV \nand it loads it as a data frame whereas \nwith Json I try and get it to user try \nto get it to user generator so it \ndoesn't obviously you know Json files \ntend to be quite large if you're reading \na corpus \num but yeah so you can adapt that to \nyour data set size if it's small enough \njust if you use a data frame it'll save \nyou a lot of time because pandas are in \nfor a particular data data type based on \nthe kind of data you have \num so did it up to like do as much work \nin terms of identifying data types \nyourself based on some samples of the \ndata \nsounds good \nso and and I know you we had like a \nlittle request slash announcement slash \nuh thingy you know I can show the banner \nyou know if you in case \nokay sorry yeah um I was just assume \npeople would have had enough of me after \n10 minutes so uh so if you did get the \nvb8 newsletter \num that went out last week I believe you \nmight have heard about this and the uh \nwe've been making some updates to our \ndocumentation \num the authentication part in particular \nand shout out to Dirk who's been helping \nme a lot a lot with this and he's uh in \nparticular working on our clients \nand the authentication capabilities that \nthey will support natively so it's been \ndoing a lot of really cool work on that \nI've been kind of learning a lot about \nhow oidc Works \num one of the things we would like to \nbetter understand is your as webiate \nusers your needs and your desires as to \nwhat are your authentication needs what \nis your preferred things like \nauthentication provider what is your \nprefer what are your preferred clients \nin terms of languages is it python we \nthink it's mostly python but would love \nto hear what the breakdown looks like \num and and you know if you are using \noidc as your authentication provider or \nmechanism what uh YDC what they call \nflows which are different kind of \nworkflows or mechanisms by which they \nprovide the tokens right so we've got a \nsurvey it went out along with the \nnewsletter but um I'll just drop a line \nin the comments I believe with the link \nto survey so if this is relevant to your \ninterests of course uh you know \num if you're not don't worry about this \ntoo much but if you would love to hear \nfrom you um please feel free to a \nresponsive survey or just even catch up \nwith us on our slack Channel \nokay I think that's perfect thanks so \nyeah so that's I'll drop that up here \nabout now YouTube in a couple of seconds \nwhen I get to it yeah I think \nsorry JP \num all right this is excellent this is \nexcellent so uh next up we have Zen uh \nZen what are you going to talk to us \nabout hello can you all hear me yeah I \ncan okay awesome \num so today I wanted to talk about a \nreally cool data set that we've been uh \nworking on and this is a data set from \nmeta uh their AI team formerly Facebook \nit's called sphere so I'll post a link \nfor this in the chat here for people \nthat are interested and this is a \num this is the announcement that they uh \nthat they posted when they came out with \nthis data set \nand and you should be seeing that in the \ncomments uh soon here but the idea \nbehind fear is that it acts like a \nknowledge base so that you can train \nlarge language models uh on using that \nknowledge base so where does it come \nfrom simply stated basically engineers \nat meta scrape the web they scraped \nabout 130 million uh news articles and \nthey chopped up those 130 million news \narticles into 100 word uh sentences or \nSnippets essentially \nand then they uh release that open \nsource that as a as a data set so in \ntotal there's about approximately 900 \nmillion sentences or statements that \nconsist of the sphere data set and the \nreally cool thing about the sphere data \nset is that it's one of the very few \nlarge-scale data sets that have not only \nthe sentence so something like \nMcDonald's is an american-based uh fast \nfood chain it will have that sentence \nbut it also has the vectorized \nrepresentation for that sentence so \nyeah 900 million very large scale so \nSebastian if you share my screen here I \ncan show you exactly what one data point \nlooks like in this uh in this data set \nyeah so there you can see that every \nevery data point has an ID just a unique \nidentifier it has the URL the the \narticle from which they got that \nsentence it has the title of that \narticle and then it has the raw uh \nnatural language what what are those 100 \nwords that consist of that data point \nand then it has the vectorized \nrepresentation for that uh for that uh \nfor that text right so hey Zen um small \nInterruption can you like zoom in just \nlike one or two steps just so that \neveryone can see and then please \ncontinue \noh \nis that better \nyes \nyeah so \nokay I can zoom in even further if it's \nuh here let me let me I think should be \nfine yeah Okay cool so let me \nnice so this is just one you have 900 \nmillion of these guys this is just one \nuh one application right so this is the \nactual 100 word uh 100 word entry and \nthen you have the vectorized \nrepresentation for this which is uh \nwhich are all these uh all these uh \nfloating Point numbers here right but \nthe main idea behind this the reason why \nthis data set is special is that you can \nconduct hybrid search on this data set \nso let's dive into what that means you \ncan use conventional uh word matching \nsearch so you could uh you could say \nwhere in my database do I have the words \nHigh Commission of India in there and it \nwould literally do like a regular \nexpression type word matching and it \nwould give you all the uh returned uh \nobjects but you can combine that along \nwith semantic search where now you can \nsay \nshow me all the articles that have these \nwords in the in the article itself or \nthey have these words in the name of the \narticle but also they they are the \nclosest in in terms of the vector space \nuh to to a particular article right so \nyou can combine both Vector search as \nwell as uh as well as your word matching \nand \nso this is a very large data set where \nyou have both the vectorized \nrepresentations and the text field \nrepresentations of uh of your \num of 900 million statements essentially \nand so the reason why this is why we're \nlooking at this is because the amount of \napplications for this uh large code base \nare are Limitless essentially you can \nthink about applications from fake news \nuh all the way to question answering \num to hybrid search I mentioned one of \nthe main applications of this is The \nBenchmark algorithms for hybrid search \nright and so what we did and we have a \nblog post out about this that came out \nyesterday so if you're more interested \nin this you can read more about it and \nI'll post that in the in the YouTube \ncomments as well but essentially what we \ndid is \nwe wanted to make this data set very \naccessible meta AI open sourced it but \none of the um the problems that it it's \nvery hard to get it set up on your own \ncomputer I tried to get it set up on my \nsystem and it was quite difficult so \nwhat we did is we took the sphere data \nset and we chunked it up into 100 000 \ndata points a million data points that \nessentially different size chunks and \nthen we released it so that you can go \nto you can go to the blog post and you \ncan get different chunks of this data \nset and then you can play around with it \nand so in our blog post we talk about \nhow you can take different sizes of \nthese uh of this data set you can bring \nit into a python environment or a spark \ninstance and then you can populate uh \nweaviate you can import this data set \ninto rewind and then you can do all \nsorts of interesting uh search or \nfunctionality that weva has on the \nsphere data set and so if you're \ninterested in that let me let me post \nthe \nlet me post the link here actually \nI'm curious if that's going to work \nbecause uh it seems like YouTube doesn't \nallow sharing links so maybe what we \nhave to do is uh update the description \nof the video after uh we're done and \nthen possibly tweet those as well \num yeah \nyeah we were just a bit too optimistic \nhey it's part of the learning process \nyeah \nbut yeah that's that's uh essentially \nwhat we did here is we took uh we we \ntook this data set that is really \ninteresting to work with we chunked it \nup so that it's easily accessible and uh \neasy to import into python or spark for \nthe uh wider developer community and \nthen we we had some fun with it we \nbasically imported this data set into uh \ninto \num into Eva and then we started doing \nhybrid search on this so all of that is \ndetailed if you want to follow along all \nthat is detailed in the blog so you can \nyou can read through it as well \nperfect this is exciting \num I know you have another topic that \nyou want to touch on but uh I would like \nto maybe Circle back to you uh because \nuh you also just mentioned uh hybrid \nsearch which is sort of like a like a \ncue for Erica because I know Erica you \nare looking into that yes \num do you wanna like let me maybe I can \nshare your screen and then uh you can \ngive us a bit of insight of what this is \nabout yeah be great \nall right there we are \nall right so what hybrid search does is \nit combines Vector search with \ntraditional keyword search in one query \num so yeah I'm sharing my full screen \num so here this is the GitHub issue for \nhybrid search and it is going to be \nreleased in the 117 which is planned for \nDecember 20th I believe uh this month \num but I will say I can share the link \nin the YouTube comments I think you said \nit doesn't work but we can handle that \nat another time \num but if you would like to vote on \nadding filters to bm25f and hybrid \nsearch you can click on this Emoji here \nand that's useful feedback for us to use \nand prioritize all right so back to the \nconsole \num I have this query on how to fish an \nAlaskan pollock and what this is the \nalpha if it is set to zero at the moment \nit is done search and if it is set to \none then it is sparse um so it's really \num one I mean the whole point of showing \nthis is that it's very intuitive and \nvery easy to use hybrid search so if I \njust run this and if I have Alpha set to \n0.5 this is hybrid search so I was using \na mix of both so you can run this and \nthe first result is The Ultimate Guide \nto Alaskan pollock fishing which is \nexactly what we're looking for right so \nit's just extremely easy to run this \nhybrid search and if we are curious on \nhow it is scoring it um we can use this \nadditional filter and then type in \nexplain score \nand this will be cleaned up just a \nlittle bit but I just want to like show \nwhat it looks like right now um so we \ncan see that bm25 has contributed this \namount and whereas a vector it's missing \nin this little part but it's supposed to \nbe Vector is scoring at this amount of \nThe Ultimate Guide to Alaskan public \nfishing \num so yeah I just wanted to show a quick \npreview of hybrid search and how easy it \nis to use in the VP console and I will \nshare a link to the GitHub issues \nin a few \nthank you this is exciting that and I \nreally love how like the kind of things \nthat we're introducing on the Fly and \nthen the kind of things that Vivid can \ndo and is really exciting and I actually \nreally love the fact that you were able \nto like do that preview of of what's \ngoing on because this is also a good \nmoment for anyone to give us feedback \nright so if you look at this query and \nyou're like well this looks actually \nrather complicated which I don't think \nit is actually personally it's pretty \nstraightforward hybrid query Alpha but \nany ideas any suggestions like that \nthere's still time for us to maybe act \non it and then so feel free to give us \nfeedback to to let us know or just say \nlike hey double thumbs up this is \namazing we love it right like so uh yeah \nabsolutely so uh thank you for sharing \nthis Erica because uh this is so cool \nthis is this is mind-blowing and that \ncomes from a person that didn't know the \ndifference between Spurs and dense \nvectors uh six months ago so now I'm \nlike so excited \nbecause you're always \nnice excellent excellent \num yeah uh let me see who have we got \nnext uh so \num \nso Connor you you're doing like a an \noverview of like what's new in \nuh in Ai and research so how about we do \nthat right uh \ntell us what's new in in AI in November \nright like what papers have you been \nreading uh what what really you got \nexcited about because this is like yeah \npretty exciting stuff as well awesome \nyeah well I think uh firstly the \nobviously the the chat gbt is the big uh \nis the big thing so but kind of I want \nto start with this new thing called Lang \nchain so uh Lang chain is about how we \nuse prompting and kind of this glue in \nthe middle of how we use large language \nmodels so as a quick example uh recently \nyou know I was writing this blog post on \nref to VEC and it had some errors in it \nJP Sebastian Erica Zane they helped me \nclean up this article \nand so I was thinking I wonder how well \nuh gbt can edit text and I've been \nfascinated with this idea of editing \ntext for a while now because I think it \nmakes a lot of sense is sort of how you \nwould use a language model to generate \ntext so the idea of Lang chain is to \nhave these sequential prompts so first \nyou say correct the grammar and spelling \nthe sentence and then you say break up \nany long sentences into two or more \nshorter cleaner sentences and so I've \npurposely kind of uh deleted some of the \nuh like made the text incorrect a little \nbit like say ref the back is short \ndeleted the T \nhey yeah should I be sharing your screen \nby the way uh oh sorry I didn't know \napologies \nokay is it showing yes it is now yes a \nbit small but we can see your screen \nokay great uh so I'll zoom in quickly \nand explain this um so Lane chain is \nthis new library as I just said it's \nlike starting from the beginning but so \nit's like a way of uh chaining together \nprompts so you have sequential \ngeneration of language models as well as \nother things that we'll get into next so \nthis is a quick example you give it the \nproblem correct the grammar spelling the \nsentence Pat paste in the paragraph then \nit'll take that output as input to this \ninput and then break up any long \nsentences into two or more shorter \ncleaner uh sentences and when it runs I \nguess it's running slowly but anyway so \nit'll iteratively edit the sentence \nso I think and then you can kind of \nmonitor your billing with the open Ai \nand I think generally is just an \nincredibly interesting kind of thing \nuh so I wanted to start off by showing \nthat quick example of langchang with the \nsequential prompting and that and that \nkind of idea of text editing to sort of \nset the stage for this idea of having \niterative prompting and what that even \nmeans but sort of the thing that's more \ninteresting especially in connection to \nalleviate is this problem of \nhallucination this is like the core \nproblem of these large language models \nso I saw this on LinkedIn somebody said \nuh chat gbt is a search engine forget it \nthe question is does Lori Mark Kanan \nplay for the Chicago Bulls and chatur \nsays yes he plays with Bulls when really \nhe's been traded to the Utah Jazz \nso but what you can do is if you prompt \nit by saying here's a history of Lori \nmarkan's NBA basketball career then you \ncopy and paste Wikipedia data then chat \nGPT will read the thing and tell you the \nright answer so the idea of levia would \nbe to retrieve the context that's needed \nto ground Chachi petite and factually \nrelevant information \nso what we're looking at with Lang chain \nis how to really integrate this tool use \nI mean there's of course the general \nidea of just you use the query to \nretrieve and then you just concatenate \nthe retrieved context with the query and \nthen just generate from there and that \nmight work pretty well with just a \ngeneral prompt like please ground your \nyour answer in this factual information \nbut there's also this exciting idea of a \nlanguage model tool use so we view it \nhas different kinds of queries so say \nyou have all sorts of different objects \nand you're about to search through an \nobject and maybe the language model \nwants to say how many documents do I \nhave or how many uh I don't know \nparagraphs like imagine these data \nschemas with weave yet where you can \nhave multiple classes you might want to \nrun an aggregate query or you might want \nto run different kinds of hybrid search \nor vector search with wear filters all \nthese different kind of filters that you \ncould use and you can describe an \ninterface that explains the tool to the \nlanguage model and the language model \nwill kind of know how to use it and this \nwhole idea of self-ass Chain of Thought \nprompting \nI think oh this is just incredibly \nexciting so let's get a little more into \nchat gbt and why it's different from \ngbt3 \nso the the what they say in the paper \ninstruct gbt the language modeling \nobjective predicting the next token on a \nweb page from the Internet is different \nfrom the objective follow the user's \ninstructions helpfully and safely so \nthus this is this term called alignment \nthat's what that's like kind of the \nbuzzword that describes his research is \naligning the language model with like \nwhat we wanted to do we don't just want \nit to predict what is most likely we \nwanted to do useful things \nso the way that they oh \nsorry I deleted this slide I guess oh \nall right anyway so what they do and \nI'll just describe this quickly is they \nhire a team of 40 expert uh 40 \nannotators and so what these annotators \ndo is first they take the prompt that \ngpt3 received on the commercial API and \nthey write their own answers for it so \nthat's used as a supervised learning \nBaseline so you take the original gbt3 \nand you fine tune it to copy the answers \nthat the humans had written then what \nyou do is the the fine tune gbt3 is \ngoing to generate continuations and the \nhumans are going to score are going to \ncompare two of them at a time to train a \nreward model and then that reward model \nis used to continue training the open AI \nthe uh chat gbt with proximal policy \noptimization so what proximal policy \noptimization is is uh the the the \nlanguage model makes a sequence of \ndecisions \nand eventually it receives a reward so \nthe supervision is that reward for each \nof the decisions and it updates as \nparameters like that \nso I was a little curious about you know \nhow much data did they collect I think \nthat's kind of the key question is like \nwhat's the sample efficiency of this \nreinforcement learning from Human \nfeedback like how expensive is it to \ntrain these annotators and get this data \nbut they don't give you in the paper the \nexact number of annotations they just \ngive you the number of number of that \nthey have I think it's safe to say that \ntimes 40 is the upper bound maybe I you \nknow assuming that each of the \nannotators annotated them once \nso that's kind of the key idea and you \nsee this difference in gbt3 compared to \ninstruct gbt on the question of what is \nthe purpose of the list C in the code \nbelow \nso kind of pivoting topics I want to \ntalk a bit about this idea of the chat \ngbt that's been trained on internet text \ncompared to say some large language \nmodel that's been trained on like \nspecific massive text so Galactica was \nthis model for meta AI that came out \ntrained on over 48 million papers and \nthey actually took it down because this \nhallucination problem they you know it \nwas people come to it for scientific \nfacts and then it's when it does the \nincorrect generation it you know people \nwere kind of irritated with that \nso this is kind of an example you know \nit's trained on this kind of things like \nSmiles strings code latex expressions \nand it's just a different kind of \npre-training Corpus but I think the key \nquestion more so is Galactica versus \nchat gbt do we think these large \nlanguage models need to be trained on \nspecific data or do they just betray are \nthey just train on any kind of data and \nthen we can just retrieve the specific \ndata and then just append it in the \ncontext and the language model is the \ngeneral Reasoner rather than some kind \nof specific knowledge holder and I think \nwe're leaning more towards the second \nParadigm where you have the chat gbt can \nreason across any data and then \nsomething like weave retrieves the \nspecific data to the specific problem \nyou're working on and tools like Lang \nchain maybe glue in the middle part of \nit and we'll see how that all develops \nand of course weaviate is agnostic to \nexactly which part of the thing you plug \nin you could you know plug in your own \nlanguage model or you could use open AI \nsimilarly with the retrieval models \nso now let's talk about model inference \nand I almost talked myself out of \nleaving this joke in here so hopefully \nit goes well so model inference is super \nexpensive so you've seen tweets from Sam \nAltman saying that they're spending \nabout 10 cents per every time someone \ninterfaces with chat gbt and so I think \nthis is a really interesting thing to \nconsider as I've been playing with the \nLang chain I've been spending about like \none to three cents per generation but I \nthink it's definitely something that \nwill change the way you use these things \nif you have to be like every time I \ngenerate it it's going to cost me like \n10 cents to probably change the way that \nyou use chat GPT \nso there was a lot of stuff on model \ninference that came out I'm just going \nto focus on one quick nugget of it uh \nyou know there's papers from Google on \nhow they're running 500 billion \nparameter models and really detailing it \nbut uh this this kind of so one of these \nresearches is from neuromagic which is a \ncompany working on sparsity for \ninference acceleration that I'm really \ninterested in and the headline of this \nthey're you know they're using second \norder pruning this Hessian matrix thing \nis super interesting but the takeaway is \nallowing us for the first time to \nexecute a 175 billion parameter model \ninside a single GPU so you know \nobviously if you could run this on a \nsingle GPU that is a breakthrough in how \nexpensive these models are to run \nso I spent last week in New Orleans at \nnurips and this talk was the one that \nstood out to me more than anything else \ninteraction-centric AI so we've seen \nthis kind of this terming of \nmodel-centric data Centric uh where you \nknow I didn't even realize data Centric \nhad run its course I thought it was \nstill the new thing but now there's \ninteraction Centric so model Centric AI \nis about you know these metrics and you \nsay they he shows this example where you \nknow you're trying to generate images \nand you're solely measuring the quality \nbased on you know how realistic these \nimages are with metrics like Inception \nscore on these ground truth image data \nsets then data Centric AI came along and \nI think startups like snorkel AI was \nwere pushing this term really heavily \nwhere you know it's it's about let's \nclean up this data sort of similar to \nthe idea of Galactica versus chat gbt \nwhere it's like instead of just language \nmodeling something like the sphere \nCorpus let's language model like \nscientific papers and smile strings and \nstuff like that so data Centric I AI was \nall about you know curate that the data \nand organize the data really well and \nnow interaction Centric AI is I think \nquite a different Paradigm it's about \nimproving the user experience making it \nlike usable and making sure humans can \nuse the AI for what they are doing so uh \nDr Kim explained this by showing this \nexample compared to someone who's \ninteracting with the generative model to \nproduce an image you know you do this \nkind of prompt thing and what are the \ntrade-offs of this user interface you \nknow it's sort of intuitive as you you \nknow prompt the dolly to \nthen there are problems with it like \ntrial and error you know lack of \nspecific feedback and these kind of \nthings is like The Guiding line for how \nwe're building these systems so with our \nsearch systems are we just going to tell \nyou the ndcg on you know the beer \nbenchmarks or are we going to tell you \nyou know maybe plugging it in with that \ngbt and measuring how long it takes \nhumans to complete tasks and I think \nit's moving more so in like a human \nsubject testing kind of Direction \nin addition to these kind of automated \nmetrics \nand then it you know it's the idea of \naligning models with user intent the \nalignment that we discussed from openai \nwas obviously this reinforcing learning \nfrom Human feedback but now I want to \ntransition into another paper that came \nout on aligning models with user intent \nin our search systems which is Task \naware retrieval with instructions so \nthis they're setting the problem \nparticularly where you're using a search \nsystem and you're going to explicitly \ndescribe your intent as well as your \nquery \nso they give the example of you search \nimplementing batch normalization in \nPython now you could be looking for \nother questions you could be looking \ndirectly for the answer or you might be \nlooking for the python implementation so \nthe it's it's sort of like balancing all \nthese intents in one in the query \ncompared to where if you like explicitly \ntell it I want to find python code I \nwant to see who else has asked questions \nlike this or just give me like the you \nknow like the Stagger overflow answer \nthat kind of thing \nso they gather all these information \nretrieval data sets and they write \ninstructions so natural questions has \nthe instruction retrieve a Wikipedia \nbeing the data domain paragraph the \nunits compared to say like sentence \ndialogue response that answers this \nquestion which is the intent \nso for all these data sets like you know \nnatural questions arguana SCI fact they \nwrite this long list of explanations of \nthe intent behind these tasks that they \nBenchmark and you see how they have so \nthis is these are the instructions used \nin training and then say these are the \ninstructions used in testing so you have \ntrain tests not only data splitting but \nalso instruction flooding \nso I'll go quickly they you know they \ntrain the models particularly where \nyou're encoding the instruction as well \na couple different architectures for \ndoing that whether it's just like a buy \nencoder style of doing it or whether you \nhave the cross encoder style of doing it \nand then how you kind of sample the \nnegatives and the negatives could be \neither you know a hard example where uh \nyou know it's like um \nuh it's like a different kind of \nargument or it could be like an inverse \nof the instructions so the instruction \nis particularly being perturbed so the \nnegative is that this thing didn't \nfollow the instruction \nso here are some of the results and I I \nreally think the most interesting thing \nis what we talked about in the first \nmovie theater show which is prom \ntogether and comparing it with this kind \nof approach \nso prom together is the idea they use \nthe large language model to generate \ntraining data for specific retrieval \nmodels for specific intents and at first \nI like that idea a lot but now it sounds \nsort of maybe \noverly complex compared to if this idea \nworks I think this is a bit of a simpler \nway to do it \nand then this is the ablation of the \nimpact of instruction \nso then kind of another paper that came \nout is about how we measure information \nretrieval benchmarks and I really like \nthis is about the cost for one million \nqueries you see say bm25 is really cheap \nuh and I actually the problem with this \nis I'm not super familiar with all these \ntechniques uh so dessert ance I think \nthese are like vector retrieval methods \nand I'm still kind of taking apart the \ndifferences in The Colbert \nimplementations like how the plate \nengine speeds it up and displayed uh \ndisplayed vectors I think is like a \nlanguage modeling uh head on top of the \ntokens but but I think what's more \nimportant is just this kind of focus on \nnot only how well it can retrieve things \nbut how much does it cost you to do that \nso then kind of another idea in \nefficiency is this paper called Citadel \nwhich is a way to improve the efficiency \non Colbert \nso here are the results are showing that \nyou know Citadel achieves really high \nyou know performance as well as low GPU \nlatency \nso the idea of Colbert is in addition to \njust kind of so the original Vector \nsearch idea is you pool along all the \ntoken representations to get the \nrepresentation of the question the \nrepresentation of the documents and then \nbang you search through the passages the \npassage vectors in Colbert what you do \nis it's a re-ranking thing where first \nyou would search through this and then \nyou have the maximum similarity of the \ninner product with the token vectors \nattending to all the other token vectors \nso uh you know it's probably gonna be \nlike 512 token vectors so you have a \nvector Source through that so now what \nthey're thinking about is like uh we \nspeed probably doesn't need to attend to \nall these other tokens how can we have \nsome kind of sparse Activation so \nthey're using the same idea as splayed \nwhich is this kind of like add a mass \nlanguage modeling head onto the token \nrepresentation to get some kind of \nsparse Vector because Mouse language \nmodeling is going to predict what token \ncould replace it in the length of the \nvocabulary so it kind of produces these \nlike keyword representation similar to \nbm25 so they're using that to have the \nsparse routing and make Cobra more \nefficient \nuh so then I'm super excited about this \nidea because I think it's very \ninteresting to just be learning more \nabout hsw and the you know the vector \nindex structures so the key idea in Ood \ndisk a n is that when query data is \ndrawn from a different distribution so \nimagine that we build up our Vector \nindex of image embeddings and the \nqueries are text embeddings so it's \nactually disk a n face inverted file and \nhsw they're going to lose a lot of their \nperformance Advantage when this happens \nso the authors proposed some \nimprovements where in robust vamana you \nknow when you have the graph \noptimization step where you're making \nsure that with the greedy search \nheuristic you can reach all the uh \neverything in the base set you're going \nto add a small set of the Ood queries to \nthis kind of graph connectivity \noptimization that helps a lot \nI don't quite yet understand how they've \nmodified product quantization but \nthey're adding pivots to it optimizing \nwith gradient descent and then they also \nhave this parallel order thing which is \nright now when you're doing the graph \ntraversal you pretty much you Traverse \nthe hnsw graph and then you add the out \nneighbors into the memory and this is \nusually done via Random Access which has \na lot of large cache Miss rates so they \nhave this graph reordering to kind of \nput the out neighbors together in the \ncache so you retrieve it efficiently and \nthis results in plus 40 latency plus 15 \nrecall benchmarked on these data sets \nlike searching through image indexes \nwith text and I think this is extremely \ninteresting for us to be mindful of as \nwe're you know building up multimodal \nsearch indexes or so you could also have \njust like you you have a text index of \nnutrition facts and then the queries are \nlike all about cancers something like \nthat I know it's kind of a dark thing to \ngo to but it's so it's it is a \ndistribution shift in the queries \ncompared to the documents and it would \ncause this kind of performance \ndegradation in the index so to summarize \nI'm super interested in chat gbt and \nlarge language models Lang chain putting \nthe glue between weviate retrieving the \ncontext and chat gbt you know reasoning \nacross the context and I think it's a \ncomplete paradigm shift for how we're \nthinking about how you use custom data \nand deep Learning Systems I think this \ninteraction-centric AI thing is a is a \nhuge step in how we're thinking about \nevaluating these systems I'm super \ninterested in these estimates of exactly \nhow much these different retrieval \nstrategies costs and then tricks like \nCitadel to \nyou know make it more efficient and then \nI think this Ood disk a n was super \nInsight insightful about you know Vimana \nhnsw product quantization and the ideas \nI think that are core to alleviate as \nwell as the user experience for search \nso thank you so much for watching uh \nplease any comments I'd love to have \nanswer and please check out we've yet to \nlearn more about the web Vector search \nengine \n[Music] \nthank you Connor this was a very \ninsightful and very interesting as \nalways \num and uh yeah if anyone has any \nquestions about any of these parts that \nConnor described just now and and papers \nthat he covered or any other things like \nfeel free to drop us a question \num and we talked about I I only \nmentioned something that Zen has another \nthing he wanted to share but I think \nit's also a pretty good excuse because \nthen there's a question for you uh \ncoming from Ari \num basically I was like yeah for a \nsphere data set does the vector \nrepresent the embedding only for the raw \ntext or Does it include the title Etc \nwhat do we know about it then yeah \nthat's a good question \num \nI actually don't know the answer to that \nbecause I would assume that it includes \nboth the raw text and the title because \nthe model that they're using to \nvectorize these uh vectorize this raw \ntext as a sentence to Vector model it's \nactually the DPR model and \nit has the ability to you can \nconcatenate multiple passages together \nand it would convert it into a like a \n700 approximately 700 dimensional Vector \nbut I don't know in the actual training \nof this in the creation of sphere \nwhether they concatenated the title with \nthe URL with the description that's a \ngood point Connor do you do you have any \nidea around the generation did they do \nthat or \nuh yeah so uh the the vectors came from \na dense passage retrieval model from \nmeta that is not open source but we were \nable to we uh grabbed a dense passage \nretrieval model from hugging face and \nconfirmed like we ablated a few models \nand this one is like pretty close so it \nprobably was like fine-tuned from that \ncheckpoint and didn't change the \nrepresentation space too much or \nsomething like that \nbut do we know if they um so did they \nonly train it on the text the raw text \nor did they also concatenate the title \nwith the raw text in the generation of \nthese uh 700 dimensional vectors \noh that's a good question \num sorry I'm not sure I know that in \nweave yet we we have the vectorized \nclass name thing um \nyeah that's a good question I'm not sure \nif it's common to vectorize titles with \nthe \nyeah that's a good point because I read \nthe the paper on the sphere data set \nlike the the web is your oyster that \npaper and I also read the DPR paper and \nit doesn't mention whether or not they \nconcatenate the title with the raw text \nso \nthat's still an open question that's a \ngood point I don't know I you \nintuitively would think that they would \ndo that but you know uh not exactly sure \nI also had a question about one of the \nthings that you were talking about \nConnor \num so I recently learned about the data \nCentric approach and there was actually \na challenge around data Centric and now \nthey're they're moving on to interaction \nCenter \num \nhow do you validate or like \nhow do you know if a model trained in \nthis interaction-centric way is valid is \nit more around a b testing or like \nfor for good old \num model Centric I could just I have all \nthese validation metrics and it's well \nstudied and the theory is all known I \nhave no idea what interaction Centric is \nyeah I I agree with everything you said \nI'm still trying to piece it together as \nwell because you think that if it was \nthe human demonstrations you could try \nto have that in a model-centric way \nwhere you still have the metrics kind of \nbut I guess it's about thinking about \nhow fast can JP generate the image of \nyou know the if he's trying to generate \nsome particular image how fast does it \ntake him I think compared to just the \nquality of the image \nokay \nyeah it seems like every every day where \nI was only getting used to the data \nCentric approach and now we have another \nCentric approach and this field moves \nfast \nyeah I I was like I don't know why yeah \nsame exact thought behind \nyeah we just need to wait for the corner \nCentric models \nand approaches \nexcellent \num so then I know you have one more bit \nto cover uh and uh go on \nyeah did we want to talk a little bit \nabout the uh or not not yet \nyeah so the one billion oh yeah yeah \nyeah yeah \nI'm sorry \nyeah I I am recovering from bit of a \ncold or something that that's my excuse \num yes so yeah very good point um so I \nwas so excited about it that like my \nmind went completely blank \num but intro the really interesting \nthing about this um the experiment that \nwe went with sphere uh and then that's \nsomething that we've been also going uh \nas a true as an exercise uh we are we \nyet we are trying to uh push Vivi to go \nget to \nwith one billion objects uh that will go \nin into vv8 uh so this is actually a \nreally big deal and how big of a deal is \nit is um uh literally I was talking to \nattia and who's our CTO and he's like a \nyear ago uh we're like pushing one two \nmillion objects into VV that was a big \nuse case right and then so 12 months ago \none two millions and we just literally \ngo to like the next scale of like going \nto a billion and and literally the the \nthe the process of how when we're \nimporting the the big uh there's the \n960m uh file that file from sphere that \nwe're importing it and this was actually \na conversation with I think that was \nDerek one of our engineers and uh and \nTien \nI was like hey Derek what's going on \nhow's the import going and then there \nwas like yeah we are at 700 million uh \neverything looks fine like like it just \nkeeps going like like super fast uh and \nthen like it hit 900 and it was like yep \ndidn't even we didn't even break the \nsweat you know that was like so cool uh \nwhere the only reason why we didn't hit \n1 billion is because we ran out of data \num but like resources wise and all of \nthat it was uh it was super uh it was \nreally great to see uh and and then like \nwe had and this is the thing and it's \nnot even a joke like we are already \ninternally talking about like trillion \nobjects right uh because 12 months ago \nif I told at the end I was like hey can \nwe do a billion you probably have a \nheart attack and then today we were like \ntrillion I was like yeah sure like uh \nwhat's the next magnitude once we have \nto achieved this uh this is absolutely \nuh crazy that we can achieve those kind \nof things uh without even being nervous \nabout it uh and then this is just a \nmatter of uh use cases and I think as \nthen as you were preparing for the blog \npost uh Bob like our CEO he actually run \nsome live queries for us that were \nlooking to include in the blog post and \nI think you have so yeah we were able to \neven query that data set while the whole \nthing was importing and then at the end \nlike the response rate was uh still \npretty decent I'm not going to throw any \nnumbers because I don't know them from \ntop of my head but it was actually quite \ngood right like it was like wow that's \nthat's impressive that's impressive and \nI I think Zen you can tell us a bit in \nterms of like the structure of how the \nwhole thing was structured in terms of \nthat import \num \nyeah yeah for sure so uh basically what \nwe did is uh you have a way that if you \nwant to get your feet wet I would \nrecommend going just with the direct \npython import because that's about what \n65 lines of code and you can get uh I \nwouldn't recommend putting all 900 \nmillion I don't think that's physically \npossible but we did it just uh just for \nfun so there's proof in the in the blog \nas well but I would recommend taking the \n100 000 data points of sphere \nimporting into vva and start querying \nthat and just one of the examples that \nwe showed uh in the blog post was you \ncould import \nsphere and then you can ask it you can \ndo hybrid search on it so if you're \ninterested in the example we used was \nwhat is uh good food to get in Italy and \nthen also do word matching at the same \ntime to make sure that you're getting it \nfrom credible sources and yeah I'm not \ngoing to release any uh any stats around \nhow quick or how slow that was but I \nthink if there is interest from the \ncommunity we're also planning uh to have \na more specific uh post on how the how \nthe road to 1 billion looked like right \nas we were importing all of those \nobjects \num so we're talking about releasing \nthose numbers as well and if there is \ninterest then we'll definitely do that \nas well \nyeah I mean that's kind of the beauty of \nbeing an open source company like a lot \nof the things we do is in the open right \nlike even like our benchmarks that are \non our website Etc uh like we we really \nproud about like what we are achieving \nand \num you know always and this is always \nwill be the case when we look back a \nmonth uh you know to the past we were \nlike well we were you know not where we \nare today we're like so much better so \nmuch faster it's just like uh very \nexciting that like uh the sky is the \nlimit right like uh I have a feeling \nthat like five years from now we just \nran out of data in the world and we and \nwe will be like still didn't break a \nsweat \nthat's that's kind of the Hope right in \ngeneral yeah I was about to say is there \na data set that we could try the one \ntrillion on I don't think that exists \num there is there is a bob already uh \nyou know uh showed like a couple of data \nsets that had like a one and a half \nbillion \num and so we will be trying those out \nand we'll be sharing like uh our journey \nas we go and and everything I mean in a \nway in our quest to one trillion that \nthis is going to be the new Quest \nprobably now uh we have to find that \ndata set is like uh to do that \num so yeah it would be interesting to uh \nto see what we can achieve with that and \nI guess the other thing is not just like \na sheer volume but also uh let's have a \ndata set that makes sense because if you \nhave just a trillion data points that \nyou query but you don't get any \nmeaningful information that that doesn't \nhelp much right so I think that's why \nthat sphere data set was so uh is really \ngreat because we could ask meaningful \nquestions and get meaningful answers and \nthen whilst working at a huge volume uh \nso yeah that's kind of a trick and maybe \nthat could be a question also to our \naudience right like where whether you \nwatch it live and and respond now or in \ncomments later like if you re-watch it \nlater if you think of like some good use \ncases uh data sets that you think we \nshould uh give it a go uh trying to see \nuh if you know if Sebastian starts get \nyou know breaking sweat because this is \na difficult task or not uh we should \ndefinitely do that let us know what you \nthink uh that would be really cool to \nsee \nand yes thank you Zen thank you for \nreminding me about the point because \nthat's like this is the only \nannouncement I have in this Vivid air \nand I forgot about it like how good is \nthat or how about we were it was all \nplanned we were saving the best for last \nall right well that is is that why you \nare going to talk about audio to back \nsince you this is the last topic this is \nnot this is not really a talk it's just \na bit of a teaser I'm I'm working on a \nuh a uh with the engineering team \na module that will allow you to uh pass \nin audio data and then we're using uh \nthe uh whisper model from open AI that \nwas recently open sourced and what we \nwant to do is right now you have the \nability to vectorize images and store \nthe vectors and the objects into you \nhave the ability to do that with text \nData uh soon hopefully you'll have the \nability to do that with audio data and \nthe applications that you can think of \nuh are similar to like the Shazam app \nfor example if you take a clip of uh of \na song what are the 10 closest songs to \nthat song Or if you hum a like just at \nthe conference today I was talking to \num talking to some of the speakers and \nthey were mentioning that an application \nof this could be if you hum a song what \nare some of the closest songs to that to \nthat hum right but uh I think that would \nbe a really cool application uh when it \ndoes come out so this is not really an \nannouncement or anything we're just \nwe're working on it this is a bit of a \nteaser \napplications for it yeah yeah but I \nthink it's not so much like an \nannouncement by itself but but also this \nis something that is somewhat a work in \nprogress like we we kind of like have it \non the back burner and work it towards \nit so if any of you finds that topic \ninteresting reach out to us like uh \nright right in here or on Twitter or on \nthe on the community slack like uh you \nwant to get involved like uh that would \nbe great whether it's involved through \ndirect contribution or you go like I \njust want to play with it and see if I \ncan do like this exercise what are this \nuh recognize what I want because you \nnotice this I immediately was thinking \nthere's this special test where if you \nhave a song in your head and all you \nhave to do is tap it to the Rhythm and \nthen get and make the other person uh \nguess what the song is and in your head \nyou always feel like you're tapping \nexactly and anyone should be able to \nguess it no it's almost impossible so \nyou'll be amazing if the audio to back \ncould recognize that right you even I \ndon't know you could try happy birthday \nand then none of us would know it even \nthough everybody knows like the rhythm \nof happy birthday happy birthday so that \ncould be a cool thing but yeah yeah you \nwere gonna say something go on oh yeah \nI'm so excited for the music record the \nmusic search I think like we'll connect \nit with the generative models that will \ncome up with like billions of \npotential Melody lyric combinations and \nthen you can take a snippet and be like \nanything like this right and it'll just \nbe crazy I'm just excited to see once we \ndo have that out what what the community \ndoes with it right what types of \napplication you can think of because now \nwe're getting to a point where if you \ntake any modality of unstructured data \nwe have the ability to do \nsemantically understand what you're \ntalking about whether it's the podcast \nin in a uh audio file or whether it's uh \nimages like that's the really cool thing \nto me yeah I mean you could like I was \nthinking like you could uh use it in a \nfactory where like certain machines just \nuh before they break or just be when \nsomething's about to happen maybe they \nrelease a specific kind of noise or \nsomething so what if we could train like \na model on like you know here's our \nhealthy machine Sounds here is like when \nsomething's happening or blah blah blah \nand then you could uh very easily kind \nof like then go uh you know have \nsomething that constantly uh keeps \nchecking and testing and then one point \nhey yeah there's something wrong with \nthis machine \num so that'll be interesting and as I \nwas saying I remember I read about it uh \nat one point there was this experiment \nwhere like toddlers how do you call like \na kids that are like up to a month old \nor something other toddlers right yes \ninfants infants yes yes that's the word \nuh so there's a thing with \ninfants that often you don't know what \nthey mean when they cry but apparently \nsomebody did the research where uh \nspecific types of Christ uh kind of mean \nI'm hungry I'm in pain or I'm just \nannoyed or or something and then unless \nyou like fine-tuned to to it uh you \ncan't really hear it or understand so \nthe whole thing was that that there's \nthis people that they train the dog to \nrecognize these things and there were \nthis different kind of rewards depending \non the kind of cry the dog was behaving \nin a different way giving signals on \nbehalf of the baby uh and then they were \nlike oh right okay time to change the \nnappy or like oh the baby's hungry and \nthey're actually getting it right so \nmaybe you could replace the dog with \nyour audio to vac model then that would \nbe cool \nyeah I was talking to Bob and uh Marco \nand Chris from Facts yesterday about \nlike the interfaces for chat GBC and so \nkind of the transition from the story \nyou're just telling Sebastian is I'm \ncurious about like these brain computer \ninterfaces like this whole idea of like \nyou can uh you know have Bowens bark the \nnatural language or babies cry to \nnatural language is like I think we'll \nbe able to read directly from our brain \nto send a gbt and it'll like suggest you \nthings in text \nyeah yeah I we could do that go ahead \nI read a paper recently where a group \nout of \num Stanford who's working on bci's brain \ncomputer interfaces they were able to \nreconstruct uh the imagery from a \nperson's uh EEG so brain activity they \ncould actually tell what you were \nthinking or what you were imagining in \nyour mind just by looking at the brain \nactivity and the results were fairly \ngood if you looked at the image they \nwere shown and if you looked at the \nReconstruction from the brain activity \nit was pretty amazing that you could get \nthat just from brain activity like it \nwas amazing \nyeah the future is going to be weird \nyeah that's scary technology man \nit's gonna be great it's gonna be great \num all right so let me just double check \nin case we have questions uh Shivani \nsays hi \nso like let's all say hi Shivani thanks \nfor watching \njoining us and uh saying hi uh who else \nwants to say hi he doesn't have to be a \nquestion or tell us where uh where you \nare coming from or should we bring an \nengineer or our CTO or somebody else \nlike that it doesn't necessarily have to \nalways be uh you know people from the \ndeveloper advocacy team uh so let us \nknow uh but we are all open to questions \nuh and if there's a request that you \nwant to see Bowen again and I hope one \nof you will say because Erica is tired \nof doing it just because I ask and then \nplease please ask to uh bring Owen back \nuh should we have a special camera for \nBowen I don't know like I I argue we \nshould but I think I needed some backing \nfrom the community \nuh and and I'm about to create a fake \nYouTube account just to do that \nshe sleeps all day sorry \nto just watch her sleep \nI'll watch that yeah it's better than \nwhat yeah she's very cute yeah \nso while we waiting bow and watch yeah \nthat's a very good idea then yeah we \ncould definitely do that we could do \nsome some sort of ml training that \nreacts is like yeah Bowen is hungry \nBowen is you know sleepy you know all of \nthose yeah we should definitely do that \nso whilst waiting for another question \nI'm going to do something go on I'm \ngoing you go I I can Circle back to the \noh no no you need to be at your computer \nfor this Sebastian \num can you share my screen for me \num \nwell well listen I was listening to \ntalks I did a couple of things so um \nSebastian that data you said I can now \nimport it \nwas nice \nsexy and everything there we go so when \nyou load the Json \num it's loaded pause all the data it \nloads it onto the table \nand the cool thing about this is that \nyou can choose the data type for each \ncolumn basically \num so you got the name link content and \njust the background this is uh list of \nmeerkats or something is that what's \ngoing on Sebastian \num I'm not necessarily to review but \nit's basically like a paragraph from \nWikipedia in different languages at \nleast the first three about meerkats but \nthen you have like all four and then you \nhave like other articles and some work \nyou know what's going on uh testing \nthings with different languages and and \nstuff so uh but uh I will talk we will \npublish a blog post about it on Monday \nuh that is a coordinated effort with \nsome of our partners but it's something \nreally exciting I can't tell you what it \nis just yet but I'm I swear it is going \nto be mind-blowing it's it's amazing \nwhat a teaser \num that's an amazing kind of intro so \nbasically what it does is um it's pars \nall that data and you can see the \ncolumns here with as in the schema \nBuilder section and then what we can do \nis to choose the class name topless I'm \njust going to call that \num \nmeerkats let's say and we'll add a class \nand now if we check the data we've got \nnow two classes in our data set we've \ngot the wine review data from before and \nthe meerkats data \nand all you would have to do then is \nclick on add data \nand once that's all done that takes all \nof half a second \nwe've got that imported \num since Sebastian has hang on just two \nseconds I've just dropped something \nwhat \nhello where's your laptop \nhey we're real we're next to each other \nthis is not worth a bit \num \nI'm going back but now I want to see you \ncome to my room \nuh you're in a different Hotel man \nsome like TV production magic right here \num at one point we're talking about \nwhether we should do a bit where I'm \nbasically getting broken into in the \napartment in the in the hotel but then \num didn't want to induce any any \nunnecessary Panic hey Sebastian can I \nask you are you there now \nyes fantastic so can I share my uh vs \ncard again you can't \nyeah \nwell let's see whether I actually can um \nokay cool there we go \num so if we can show that on screen so \nuh all I've changed in my code base is \nI've added this or these two lines of \ncode right so that's all I've done to be \nable to like be able to uh not pause the \nJson before because this was my Json \nparser to be honest I'm not even sure if \nthis was working before I think it would \nhave been \num but just because the structure of the \nJson was different \num this is the only code that I've \nchanged and now it is able to load the \nmeerkat Json that Sebastian sent me so \nit's quite modular um I've got a \nseparate function and there's a \nequivalent function somewhere for the \nCSV and just for the magic \n[Music] \nand what happens is \num uh basically at one point it fires a \ncallback when you press the button and \nthis is the function that it calls and \nuh you can upload the data line by line \nand you can specify things like the \nmaximum number of objects just so that \nyou don't accidentally spend you know \nlike an hour uploading objects and \nvectorizing them and when you just want \nto when all you want to do is test your \ntest your setup so yeah \num there you go are you problem solving \ndone and hopefully I get to keep my job \nwe'll see though okay \nyou're fine you save I know where you \nleave you know so what next door your \nnext door right \num no this is perfect and I'm glad that \nyou were able to update that because I \nthink that's the the value of that in \ndata importer uh and and I do hope that \nlike next year we'll have something \nwhere you anyone will be able to like \nsay like hey use all my data uh drop \nlike this uh 900 million sphere data set \nyou know objects and then go like import \nconfigure everything you know like it \nshould be a lot more automated I think \nlike the journey that we have today that \nyou can write like let's say if you're \nusing a python client or any of our \nclient I think the import process is not \nthat difficult but this was one of my \nfirst impressions when I joined the \ncompany I was like it's not that \ndifficult but it could be even easier \nright so I was super happy uh when you \nstarted kind of working on like hey it's \njust like a proof of concept is the idea \nand I think that's where we all want to \nhead towards to right like make working \nwith weave or make work work with \nvectors and then your data as easy as \npossible right it should be a no-brainer \nit already is quite easy but I think \nthere's still some improvements that we \ncan make \num and often uh we can only improve \nthings that we know of so obviously the \nImporter was kind of obvious to me to JP \nand few of us but what if there's \nsomething else that we completely \nmissing out on and it could be a low \nhanging fruit even right like something \nyou could do uh quite quickly so please \nlet us know \num so I'm a bit of a spontaneous person \nand what I'm going to do like I'm \nactually pretty happy that like Ari and \nShivani like say hi ask the question and \neverything uh so uh what I'm going to do \nis just say like I'm going to send you a \nt-shirt like to each of you like one of \nthose green wavy t-shirts uh so probably \nwhat we need is uh if you're on like the \ncommunity slack \num like Ping me and then because \nobviously you don't want to share your \naddress in here but yeah thing me with \nyour details and I'll be very happy to \nsend you a nice green wavy t-shirt \num why not like you see this is what you \ndo you say hi and uh you get a t-shirt \nbow and say hi said hi as well so I need \nto look for a bow and size t-shirt as \nwell right but one you're excited you \nwant some T-shirts yeah yeah \nI'll send some dog or snackles as well \nso that'll be fine \num all right I think uh We've covered \neverything unless I really really forgot \nwe had another thing but uh thank you \nall for uh for listening thank you for \nsending questions saying Hi and um thank \nyou for being part of the community and \nthen because that helps us do what we do \nand makes us enjoy it even more so \nthat's for me thank you for uh for \nlistening and uh thank you \nthank you thanks a lot Owen are you \nwaving as well saying thank you no thank \nyou \nbye bye everybody \n[Laughter]
