{"text": "Thank you so much for watching the 25th episode of the Weaviate Podcast! This is a really special episode with Erik ... \nthank you \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nchecking out the wevia podcast we have a \nsuper exciting episode today we have \nEric burnerton and Eddie and dillocker \nEric is one of the early thought leaders \nin approximate nearest neighbors \ncreating the annoy library at Spotify an \nincredibly interesting algorithm for \nachieving this approximate nearest \nneighbor Surge and I mean these two are \njust such talented Engineers with so \nmuch experience in building these kind \nof systems and we're here to discuss the \nmain topic of vector search and \nproduction running in production what \ndoes it take so Eric thank you so much \nfor doing the weba podcast \nhi thanks for uh being here it's it's \ngonna be a lot of fun I hope yeah thanks \nfor for uh yeah having me and of course \nEric thanks for for joining \num super cool topic and I think we can \nwe can go into all kinds of different \ndirections for what it means to run a n \nin production I think the first one to \nstart is basically \num that the history like uh Connor you \nalready mentioned uh Spotify annoy and \num yeah Eric you worked at Spotify quite \nsome time ago I think so yeah do you \nwant to start maybe telling us a bit \nabout what you did back then sort of one \nof the the first pioneers of of \napproximate news neighbor search \nyeah totally so I spent almost seven \nyears of Spotify I said 2008 to 2015. \nand a big part of what I did at Spotify \nI was building the music recommendation \nsystem and I don't want to get like \nsuper detail like how that works but \nlike roughly speaking like what we ended \nup realizing or what I ended up \nrealizing building this is that uh \nvarious types of vector models worked \nreally well so we would you know do \ncollaborative filtering on this \nextremely large sparse Matrix of what \nusers listen to and then you know \nbasically some sort of Matrix \nfactorization would then lead to vectors \nand then once we have those vectors \nyou know you could do all these sort of \nyou know they have this like nice \nproperty that you have like a fairly low \ndimensional space and you can use \nnearest neighbors to find \nrecommendations for people so you kind \nof project \nusers and tracks and artists and albums \ninto this we typically it's like 40 \ndimensions \nand then in that space it turns out like \nif you want to like find good \nrecommendations for a user you just look \nat like similar near vectors for vectors \nthat are close to that user if you want \nto find similar music to a different \ntrack you take that tracks vector and \nyou you look at uh in this \n40-dimensional space What are some other \nvectors that are close right and so the \nproblem now is like you have to figure \nout how to do this like you have to find \nnearest vectors uh fairly fast right and \nat Spotify we had a few million tracks \nat that point that was indexed in the \nrecommendation system so about I think \ntwo million tracks or something like \nthat now it's probably more it's like 10 \n20 million tracks that are indexed \nuh and uh I looked at a bunch of \ndifferent approaches and a bunch of \ndifferent existing algorithms \num \nfor various reasons like one of the \nthings I realized pretty early on was uh \nnothing deep into this but like I I \nwanted the functionality to end map it \nbecause what we wanted at Spotify was we \nhad a fairly static data set \nbut we needed to do a lot of \nrecommendations very quickly and you \nwhen you deploy this you want the \nability basically like you know create \nan index load it into whatever many \nprocesses as you have CPUs and then you \nknow do all this like here's neighbor \nsearch so I basically built a static \nfile index based on M map and it built a \nNoy and noi like basically works you \nknow kind of splits the like that the \npoint space recursively into a bunch of \ntrees does that a few times to get a \nforest and then in that Forest you can \nyou can search I do want to point out I \nthink actually today there are a bunch \nof better models I think I know I like \nStills is useful and since I think it's \nlike one of the few like kind of like \nsimple like it's just like a file \nembedded file and it's like uses M map \nuh but of course like today there's DV8 \nand many other ones uh that I think \nprobably do a much better job at finding \nuh nearest vectors very quickly \ncool thank you super cool cool summary \nand yeah it's super exciting to to hear \nbasically how how early you were in in \ndoing these things that are now \neverywhere and of course recommendation \nbeing a a big case \num and and I I noticed two things I \nthink that we can talk about a bit more \num one is you said essentially the the \nuh recommendation system or the the \nrecommendation approach was just doing a \nuh near Vector search so basically \num \ndo I see it correctly that you never had \nto do online model inference that you \nbasically that the model inference once \nbuilt your index and then sort of when \nthe user listens to a song or when they \nselect the song you really just care \nabout the nearest neighbors and never \nhad to deal uh with the inference or did \nyou have to do any inference sort of at \nwhat we would call query time in VBA but \nI guess in Spotify I don't know play \ntime \nyeah yeah I think of it as like online \nversus offline inference or like batch \ninference right like we did basically \nzero online inference when I left \nSpotify I think they do a lot now uh but \nwe would actually essentially \npre-compute almost everything right like \nso we would do these the collaborate \nfiltering models we would recompute \nevery month or something like that \nbecause they were very large and took a \nlot of time to do it now that would give \nus a track embeddings right like a few \nmillion track commandings users taste \nships faster in particular you have this \nproblem that new users come in and you \nwant to give recommendations to them \nrelatively quickly \nso we would recompute those vectors \nevery night and then every night we \nwould basically go through every user \nthat had some activity last 24 hours and \nthen pre-compute recommendations for \nthose users and I don't know if that's \nlike pretty efficient approach it just \nturned out that like the way we built \nhad the system set up at that time made \nit a lot easier to do everything sort of \na bachelor in that way \nand so that might also explain some of \nthe design decisions of how annoy worked \nit's quite optimized for more like \nthroughput rather than like sort of \nonline latency in particular that you \nknow talked about the M map you know \nit's quite optimized for for doing a lot \nof well using multi-processing and doing \na lot of things in parallel uh but \num there's probably many other ways you \ncan do it today and I'm sure Spotify \ntoday does a lot more like sort of \nreal-time stuff right like as you start \nlistening to the music probably I'm \nguessing they you know update that \nVector in real time and do inference but \nI mean there's still like batch \ndifferent stuff going on in Spotify \nright like Discovery weekly you know is \nonly recomputed every week so I think \nthere's still you know use cases for \nboth online inference and offline \ninference \nyeah cool so super hope this this um the \nsort of the the yeah doing the inference \nin batches and then having that static \ndata set that you mentioned \num I I think this is yeah as you said as \nwell it's shifting a bit but I think \nthis is for me one of the typical cases \nwhere you can easily make this this \ndistinction between a search Library an \na n search library that typically is \nbuilt for that static case so beyond \nbeyond annoy if we look at uh phase or \nGoogle scan or all these libraries \ntypically they're built for those sort \nof build once then surf kind of use case \num and and this is for me a nice point \nto sort of draw the distinction or do \nthe distinction between what is a \nlibrary and what is a database because \nwhen we started with vv8 one of the \nthings that we we wanted to give our \nusers basically from the get-go is an \nexperience as they would have in any \nother database so not So Much from the \nlike okay you're starting with a library \nand now you're trying to to sort of get \nthe library as a service but the other \nway round you're starting from a from a \ndatabase like you may be you're used to \nit to using mySQL database or or no \nsignal this doesn't matter but basically \nany database in the world you can \nincrementally sort of build up your data \nset you can do updates you can do \nfiltering these kind of things and that \nis something that that we yeah basically \nthat led our decision \num to start with hsw as the first Vector \nindex we definitely did look at annoy I \nthink we even had prototypes before uh \nwith with annoy \num I used it also in this this \nconfectionary that we have till this day \nwhich is basically like a very simple a \nsimple Battle of words model which is \nsort of static it's built on on a glove \nor fast text so we have this kind of \nstatic and if you just want to search \nwithin there we used a noise for that um \nbut yeah that that kind of sort of \nonline changeability that that was \ndefinitely one of the the reasons why we \nlooked into into hsw and yeah definitely \none of the the parts that make sort of \ndeviate a database as opposed to a \nlibrary I would say \nI think there's kind of maybe two things \ngoing on at the same time right like \nthere's like the sort of online offline \ndistinction right like and you look at \nlike a machine learning model \nuh you know you can either use that \nmachine learning models of an online \ninference or an offline inference right \nand and and and then the separate aspect \nis is the sort of the crowd support like \nsupporting like you know crud like what \nis it was a stuff for create read update \ndelete like the ability to mutate the \ndata set right and and I think you know \nlike my sort of but I think the sort of \nIdeal here is like a service that does \nall four combinations of those two \nattributes right and and also does it \nwith zero sort of performance loss \nbecause I think you know the the online \ncase is a lot harder than the offline \ncase in many cases right because you \nneed to lower light latency and I think \nI you know it's easy to sort of give up \na lot of the throughput by optimizing \nfor the online case but actually don't \nthink you have to \nuh I also think that sometimes we talk \nyou know when I look at like machine \nlearning as a whole \npeople generally tend to think of like \nmodel inference as Premier like an \nonline thing but if you actually like \nthere's like you know 5000 startups that \ndo like you know model deployments right \nbut if you look at actually how people \nuse models in you know real life I would \nsay you know it's fairly evenly split \nbetween batch inference and online \ninference right uh batch inference \ngenerally has a lot more you know uh \nit's more important that you have a lot \nof throughput so I I think but but I \nactually think there's ways you can \nbuild your system that you get you know \nthe same throughput even in an online \nmode you just have to be smart about uh \nyou know batching and other things uh so \nso to me that's like the dream that and \nyou know and I think we've been \nhopefully it delivers in those things I \nhaven't done any benchmarks uh but but I \nthink it actually does \nyeah I think on the on the the model \ninference part uh there's definitely \nroom to to grow but on the latency part \non on the search definitely \num but yeah so so batching I guess sort \nof when we think of of batching in in \nthe ml sense it's typically like this \noffline batching but you can still do \nlike a a mini batching approach right \nwhere you just do the batch just big \nenough to basically have the benefits of \nsay running on a GPU which paralyzes \nthem uh enough \num but still have it sort of in a \nreal-time approach where maybe instead \nof sending uh or instead of doing a \nhundred single inference tasks that \nwouldn't have to run sequentially just \nbatch those 100 up which happened maybe \nI don't know and then over the course of \n50 milliseconds or so and then have them \nbatch and and basically get the \nthroughput this way like trade up a bit \nof latency for for the higher throughput \nI I think this is especially important \nwhen you have like Matrix algebra going \non in your system right like we either \nyou know especially when you're using \ngpus right because like gpus benefit a \nlot from batching if you don't do that \nthen you might as well just like run \neverything with separate threads and \nit's like kind of fine you know you have \nsome locking issues but that's fine \num but I I think the sort of mini \nbatching or micro batching that you see \nin some high performance model serving \nFrameworks uh they do benefit quite a \nlot when uh when you're using Matrix \nalgebra \nyep cool yeah so media at this point is \na good good point to to tell a bit about \nthe different options that people have \nor that users have to do inference with \nwith vv8 \num because as you said some like to do \nit offline and just sort of only \nbasically do the re-index part with V8 \nso this would be the typical case where \nthe users provide their own vectors and \nthey're not using bb8 end to end but \nbasically batch indexing under do maybe \ndoing some kind of a blue green \ndeployment where class a so-so classes \nare the the isolation units in VBA where \nClass A would be serving uh with the old \nmodel you can prepare Class B build up \nthe index in the background and then \nbasically just switch the load balancer \nfrom one to another to to do this this \nkind of shift so this would be like the \nweekly example \num but then also for the the live \ninference Parts with vv8's module system \nwhich basically gives you the ability to \nplug in \num yeah any kind of kind of model really \nand not just any model but also any \nmodel provider to do the the end-to-end \ninference and there what we recently \nadded is support for for the hugging \nphase API so basically one of those \nhosted inference service types so that \nyou can really basically do do all three \nvariants that you want to do and then of \ncourse if we're talking about the \ncombination with crowd all of them them \ncan be combined with with the crowd part \nof of the database but you could \nbasically bring your own vectors which \num sort of gives you full control about \nhow you do the inference you could you \ncould do it live you could do it or you \ncould do it online you could do it \noffline you can do it with um sort of \nhosted together with vv8 so vv8 module \nsystem then just brings a small \ninference container there you can you \ncan still sort of split this up into do \nyou take what what serve what Eva \nprovides and just plug in your model or \ndo you replace the entire container so \nfor example if you say it I can do this \nbetter I can optimize this better or \nsomething I can do it or now the new \noption is basically if you want the no \nOps approach just put use use one of \nthose those third-party providers where \nwe're supporting a hugging face coher I \nthink and oh an open AI also so with \nthose those three um basically yeah \ngives you the ability to plug those in I \nthink this is super cool I I mean I \ndon't know like kind of reflecting on \nthis as like you know \nas someone who like spend time on this \nlike a decade ago or more right like I \nwhen I discovered this like vector \napproach like I like I was actually just \ntalking to someone the other day but \nlike I actually feel like that's like \none of the most profound insights I've \nhad in my life was like this like vector \napproach you know when I realized that \nback in like 2008 I'm like this makes so \nmuch sense like you have this like nice \nspace and like you can think of things \nin terms of you know euclidean you know \ngeometry right and and you know and that \nsort of mental leap for me was like \nrealizing like once you embed all these \nthings into the space like a lot of sort \nof you know relations become more like \nnatural the hard part is the query right \nand like 10 years ago or 15 years ago \nwhen I was doing this like it was very \nhard to record it so I basically like \nhad to roll up my sleeves and like build \nthis like C plus Library \nwith with python bindings uh that I \ncould import and like use you know for \nmy uh jnk Hadoop jobs uh but I always \nlike was a huge believer in sort of \nvector models and and so I'm like one \npart of me it's like extremely excited \nif the world has come around to like \nrealize like the sort of power of \nvectors yeah I'm very excited about you \nknow the sort of the new databases \ncoming out the embedding models and and \nsort of a general just like acceptance \nlike you know sort of embracing of you \nknow the fact that we're in a vector \nspace like you can use these like vector \nmodels for a lot of stuff and and like \nwhat I what I'm excited about is like I \nlook at the you know I look at all these \nlike technology in the past you know \nlike you know a very search algorithms \nor various types of ways we did like \nrecommendation relevance in the past \nlike I think there's like a huge \nopportunity to take a step back and like \nrethink so much of that from from ground \nup right uh and uh and so pretty excited \nyou know we've yet is portion of that \nkind of stuff and but also many many \nother players right like you know in \nparticular like you know it's not \noutside of search there's also a lot of \nlike work on bedding some other things I \nthink is really exciting \nso that's fantasy \nyeah and yeah yeah couldn't agree more \nand we're basically even though you \nmentioned 2008 right so even though it's \n14 years later I think we're we're still \nbasically we're still at the beginning \nlike it's it's such a massive Trend and \nit's it's gonna yeah it's Gonna Change \nsurge but but goes beyond search and \nthen we're really just at the beginning \nbut yeah what I also really like is this \nkind of growing together with the space \nand I think that was something that we \ntried to be be like from the get-go \num while bv8 can be used end-to-end like \nthat end-to-end user experience is super \nimportant we never said we need to \nentirely own the chain end-to-end like \nwe would say I don't know you could only \nuse it with models that we train or \nsomething and all of a sudden we're \ncompeting with these specialized \nstartups and then not just startups also \nGoogle and Facebook and then all of them \nare meta now \num but but really just say that okay we \nwant to integrate with those players in \nthe space and basically \ngrow grow viviate with the space but \nalso help grow the space with VBA \nbasically \npartnership \nI think that's a good approach I mean in \ngeneral like I would say when I look at \nmachine learning like I I think you know \nit's kind of bifurcating a little bit \nwhere like you're gonna have the you \nknow the Googles and Facebooks and you \nknow the other big providers like \ntraining these like enormously complex \nvery large models open AI Deep Mind and \ncohere and a few other ones right and \nmost people want to want me to train a \nmodel like they could just like take \nthese models and use the embeddings that \ncome out of these models or use the \npredictions or whatever right like \nembeddings are often like the \npenultimate or the the you know sort of \nsome intermediate layer in these models \nuh and and then like do their own you \nknow sort of fine tuning on top of that \nso I think that's like a big shift in \nlike how people work with machine \nlearning also in the last \nfive ten years five years maybe even \nlike three years I want to say \nuh but I think it also opens up you know \nsort of makes a lot easier to to use \nthese models right like in the past when \nI did things I had to do the whole thing \nend to end right like now I can just \nlike download a transforming model from \nhacking face and and do you know \ntwo-thirds of it and they can like throw \nsome like simple stuff on top of it \nwhich makes it a lot easier to do these \nthings and with great quality too there \nare so many like pre-trained models for \nEnglish and and computer vision and I \nmean any language really and and those \nmodels make the life a lot easier for a \nlot of these for people trying to build \nthe recommendations or classification or \nany sort of you know industry machine \nlearning application \nyeah and it's and it's basically getting \nbetter day by day so another topic that \nI want to talk about is benchmarks \nyou're of course um famous for for the a \nn Benchmark website but before we go \ninto that \num we talked a bit about about what you \ndid at Spotify but I'm also super \ncurious about what you're doing right \nnow and um yeah \nyeah I'm working on this uh startup \ncalled modal I I started it uh I would \nsay about a year ago and it was still \npretty early days but the idea is I'm \nsort of basically like I guess like the \nbest way to put it is like I'm building \na data tool I always wanted to have for \n20 years and so I I found that like when \nthey look at data teams how they operate \nand how to productionize things and how \nto scale things out and schedule things \nlike and how they work with \ninfrastructure and the tools they have \nit's all kind of janky like there's you \nknow there's so much like time wasted on \nlike you know dealing with \ninfrastructure product you know setting \nthings up like dealing with kubernetes \nand Docker and you know AWS and \nterraform and Helm and all this stuff \nright and and I think as a as a result \nyou know like building code and running \ndata applications today you know takes \nfive times as much time as it should do \nuh I I mean I literally like you know \nI've been wasting like the last three \ndays like trying to configure like vpcs \nenabled yes and like I really think \nthat's like hell for developer to ever \nhave to deal with uh and um and so so \nwhat is modal like yeah model basically \nlike you know we built our own sort of \nLambda style like infrastructure \nprovider for data jobs right like we \nmake it very simple Tech code and \nproductionize that in the cloud like we \nare a cloud provider in that sense like \nwe take people's code put it in \ncontainers and run it in cloud and we \ncan do it at extremely fast because we \nended up building our own uh container \nruntime and a bunch of other stuff from \nfile system and many other things and so \nthe end result is like you know if you \nwant to do especially if you're an early \nstage tech company you don't want to set \nup all this like traditional you know \nall the infrastructure uh using model \nyou can you can immediately you know do \neverything from like you know uh \nschedule retraining of your jobs to \ndeploying your friends to scaling out \nlike large scale like batch inference \nlike you know a large scale \nmapping over you know various types of \nsort of embarrassingly parallel tasks \nlike trust coding web scraping \nsimulations and back testing and and \nother things and and do build a lot of \nend-to-end infrastructure for machine \nlearning but also like other like you \nknow more like mundane data tasks like \nreporting or whatever uh and do that \nvery easily without having to think \nabout infrastructure so sort of you know \nkind of selfishly building a tool I was \nwanted to have but uh you know also sort \nof think that many other people would \nbenefit from this tool as well \nreally cool I I saw it I think it was a \nscreenshot or a short video on on \nTwitter where you shared basically the \nAPI and do I understand it correctly \nthat I can basically write python code \nand I just annotate a function and then \nit runs in the cloud \nyeah and I think the it's sort of this \nidea that I think other people have had \ntoo which is sort of people sometimes \nreferred as the self-provisioning \nruntime like the idea that like \neverything is just code right and the \ncode itself specifies what sort of \ninfrastructure it needs including the \ncontainer specification the parallelism \nlike all these other things and then \nwhen you run the code the code just like \ngets those resources in the cloud for \nitself so it's a sort of idea of you \nknow you take the app code they also put \nin all that you know container code and \nenvironments and and chrome jobs and and \ncredentials and all the stuff and just \nlike right all of it in code right like \nthere's like no config in model like \neverything is code and \num which makes it very concise makes it \nvery easier to run and um uh it makes it \na lot easier to maintain right and so \nyeah like everything in code uh is \nsomething I don't know if you ever \nlooked at palumi but it's sort of the \nsame idea for taking even further me \nonly does the infrastructure in code \nlike we also do the we do everything \nlike the infrastructure and the app code \ntogether all in Python really really \ncool can can users try this out like can \nI just could I just register right now \nor in in what state is it or would I \nhave to wait a bit sure no but but we're \nworking on so we're still in early data \nstage test right and we have a bunch of \nusers using this uh and a few paying \ncustomers and so we're you know we're \nslowly scaling up and and you know if \nyou want if you're interested in model \nfeel free to go to model.com and join \nthe wait list \num you know it would sort of definitely \ngonna make more announcements in the \nnext few months and and gradually open \nup and add more beta testers so if \nyou're interested in trying out \ndefinitely go to model.com and setup or \nput your name on the white list \ncool nice yeah so as I mentioned before \nwe we talked about model I mentioned uh \nbenchmarks and of course there is a n \nbenchmarks which um is I would say the \nde facto standard for comparing \num yeah comparing a vector surge I don't \nwant to say either libraries or \ndatabases because I guess you \ntechnically have a mix of them in there \nbut maybe I'm just going to say \nalgorithms and their implementations \nwould that be correct yeah I think \nthat's correct and it's mostly libraries \nlike it sort of started out at almost \nyou know five ten years ago and back \nthen it was mostly libraries around I \nmean a m Benders marks was like one of \nthese projects that like I got annoyed \nbecause I would read like various like \npapers at conferences and they all had \ntheir own like obscure like Benchmark \nsetups and and of course like every live \nEminem also biased because I built the \nnoi but like every Library maintainer I \nfelt at that time would build their own \nBenchmark suite and you know the world's \nlike their library was the fastest \num and and I found a lot of you know \nvery frustrating but also people \nsometimes would come up with new types \nof like a n algorithms and like and not \nBenchmark them right like one of the \nthings I was always was frustrated was \nlike this research and locality \nsensitive hashing well calories let's \nimagine like basically it doesn't work \nin my opinion like it's a terrible \nalgorithm but like people keep releasing \npapers about it because they had this \nlike nice mathematical properties but \nlike if you actually run the benchmarks \non it it's just like awful and so yeah \nso there's a couple of different reasons \nwhy I was frustrated and ended up \nbuilding my own \nbenchmarking Suite initially was kind of \njanky and you have to to like install \nall the stuff and it barely would work \nbut uh a few years in I actually set it \nup in a nice way to sort of \ncontainerized everything it made it easy \nto reproduce I added more libraries uh \nand so yeah so it's going pretty \nextensive Benchmark speed I think it's \nshowing a little bit of age in the sense \nthat it doesn't support crud it's very \nyou know all it does is like \nyou know a kind of static offline uh \nbatch inference and really just measures \nthroughput uh so kind of going back to \nthe first thing we talked about it \ndoesn't handle you know the crud case it \ndoesn't really Benchmark that it also \ndoesn't really Benchmark latency uh so \nso some libraries or databases May \noptimize for latency at the cost of \nthroughput and sorry and Benchmark \ndoesn't really optimize for that or it \ndoes really take that into account \num but I think all in all like you know \nto me like it was something at that time \nand maybe still uh there was very much \nneeded in the space because there's only \nlike libraries out there making claims \nabout you know their performance uh and \nuntil any other benchmarks I basically \ndidn't feel like there was like a sort \nof a neutral semi quasi neutral because \nagain I'm the author of annoy too but \nbut you know sort of Benchmark Suite \nthat actually try to compare all of \nthose \nyeah yeah and then I mean the the fact \nthat you're not trying to sell something \nwith it I think that that sort of gives \nyou a lot more credibility like if if we \nas semi would basically put out some \nsort of a comparative Benchmark right \nnow where we would Benchmark let's say \nbb-8 against I don't know our \ncompetitors or something I think that \nwould be you would always have to take \nthat with a grain of solvent I mean you \nshould because \num \nso yeah it's really \nyeah I agree yeah and there's all these \nlike weird ways you can like kind of \nfake it too like one of the things I I \nkind of was you know felt with the noise \nwith sort of a m like it's kind of hard \ntoo because this is sort of a weird \ntrade-off between like okay what is the \ndesired recall and what is their desired \nthroughput right like if you if you want \nto maximize throughput you can like you \nknow make the recommendations really \nterrible and vice versa if you want to \nyou know make the recall extremely good \nthen you can like you know uh you know \nmake it very slow and so one of the \nthings I also did it in benchmarks I \npushed for a lot is this sort of you \nknow you have to look at the the whole \nFrontier like the whole Pareto Frontier \nof like you have to actually make a 2d \nplot and like you know plot the \ntrade-off curves and do that for every \nsingle Library \nand what that means is like for every \nLibrary you have to run all these like \ndifferent parameters and then compute \nthat sort of you know the trade-off \ncurve after the fact like after you have \nall that data so so it's sort of \nit's a little bit tricky to do that \nthing you actually have to run you know \nlast time I ran it it took I think \nsomething like two weeks to run all the \nbenchmarks uh and uh it was a fair \namount of compute that goes into the \nrebuilding those benchmarks so if anyone \nis asking like why haven't I haven't \nupdated in a while is because it just \ntakes a little bit of time to set \neverything up and then run it but I \nshould do that at some point again \nyeah yeah definitely it's super cool \nyeah and I think that that Frontier \ncurve I think everyone who's looked at \nsome kind of a n and Benchmark or or a \nsort of a non-comparative vector search \nBenchmark everyone knows those kind of \ngraphs where like top and to the right \nis is best so that's that's yeah it's \nnice to hear that you came up with that \nbecause um basically the first time I \nlooked at an a n Benchmark which was a n \nbenchmarks that was just there so I \ndidn't didn't even think about that yeah \nsomeone had to come up with that at some \npoint \nyeah I don't know if I necessarily \ninvented that I'm sure there was in some \nolder papers too but I definitely you \nknow I do think that Hayden had \nbenchmarks like pushed for that instead \nof popularized that and you know made \nthat you know the sort of the hopefully \nthe de facto way to compare things is \nlike you know looking at the 2D Frontier \nyou know making that trade-off very \nexplicit I think is very important \nyeah yeah absolutely so in in our \nbenchmarks that we have which are not \ncomparing bb8 against something else but \nwe're just basically showing like this \nis how bv8 performs under these \ncircumstances stances we also have that \nand and it's I think this is a good tool \nas well this this kind of Frontier just \nto to educate users because \num and I I've had a couple of \nconversations with users if you're \nsaying like oh I I want a n this is so \ncool \num I I'm using this a n system and then \nthey're like why doesn't it have perfect \nrecall and then a conversation typically \ngoes like do you know like are you aware \nwhat a n is like the a and a n stands \nfor approximate nearest neighbors that's \nbasically that trade-off between recall \nand if you're like oh okay yeah that \nmakes sense but then having those kind \nof graphs and seeing like even in an \napproximate nearest neighbor situation \nyou can still achieve High recall you \njust need to need to basically give up a \nbit of latency and throughput and just \nuse the Benchmark as a as a guide \nbasically of how to set parameters and \nhow to configure it I think that's \nthat's also super super helpful \nso that's maybe not a coincidence \nmaybe some kind of subconscious decision \nfun fact one of my daughter's name is \nAnne Ann but it's not it's a pure \ncoincidence we had that name in the \nfamily and uh although she was born \nafter we had benchmarks so maybe \nsubconsciously influenced do you also \nhave a child called k n \nbut uh yeah maybe maybe one day yeah the \nfact the funny thing is I haven't really \nthought about that until now it's kind \nof weird maybe I did name her after \napproximately there's neighbors I'm \ngonna tell her that which is when she's \nolder \nyeah so so um benchmarks um basically \nwe've talked a bit about the the value \nthat they provide and um I think in a in \na sense it's \num it's really good to to have or to to \ngive use these kind of insights in um \ninto how these these algorithms perform \nand at the same time I think \nas a user how much do you care basically \nlike is there a point where you go okay \nit's just fast enough or do I need to \nlike of course everyone wants to have \nthe the best but um yeah what is sort of \nif we're talking about let's say \num a two millisecond versus a four \nmillisecond latency like is this \nsomething that matters to the user I \nmean my opinion is like you know it like \ngoing to 100 I don't think is ever worth \nthis because there's like a point where \nit just like takes longer and longer to \nlike really you know essentially just \nyou're just doing like exhaustive search \nbut like if you can get to like 99.9 \npercent \nyou know that's like usually like pretty \nmuch like good enough right that's like \nalmost as good as like 100 and you know \ngoing to 99.9 or like whatever like 99 \nuh that usually ends up being like a 10x \nor 100x improvement over exhaustive \nsearch or maybe even more a thousand X \nif you have like you know very large \ndata set and so I I think that's kind of \nThe Sweet Spot is like you know for for \nmost users if I just had to pick a point \nfor them I'd probably pick you know the \nnine you know the the three nines 99.9 \nthat percentile and you know that's \nclose enough to 100 that practice you \nknow won't be a problem uh but still you \nknow implies like a pretty you know \nsubstantial performance Improvement but \nI'm curious what you think at the end \nactually \nyeah yeah so \num definitely like I I kind of looked at \nthis from the perspective of latency and \nnot so much recall but I I like the way \nthat you're looking at this of sort of \noptimized for recall first and then see \nwhat what latency you you get and uh the \npoint that that I was going to make is \nbasically \num that let's say these two numbers that \nshe said like two milliseconds or four \nmilliseconds I think for the kind of \nslos that users have to meet for for \nwhatever they're doing on top of of \nvector search they're probably not \nserving pure Vector search to the user \nso they're probably building some kind \nof application on top \num let's say they have 100 100 \nmillisecond SLO for for \num the end-to-end thing then it's \nprobably not going to matter if it's two \nmilliseconds or if it's four \nmilliseconds however \nthis you can't really look at latency in \nisolation because latency probably also \ndives into throughput at least for the \nsame same kind of Hardware cost like \nassuming that that um it scales linearly \nacross threats and you have a single \nthreat and on that single threat it's \ntwo milliseconds or four milliseconds \nthat's basically twice the throughput \nand um that I think is is much more \ninteresting and there I think if if we \nif we take this one step further and \nthink about how do you actually run uh a \nn in production and um for example using \nthe vviad cloud service where we now \nhave usage-based pricing then it it sort \nof it I think it becomes a matter of of \ngood enough like I need this kind of \nkind of latency SLO and I need this kind \nof throughput but I can basically get \nthe throughput through horizontal \nscaling which of course increases your \ninfrastructure cost but if you have \nusage based pricing then you don't \nreally care so much about the the \ninfrastructure cost so that's basically \nwhere I think yeah you need to kind of \nprove that it's fast and fast enough and \nthat it's never going to be too slow to \nachieve your your goals but at the same \ntime yeah at the end it's basically it's \nmore kind of an optimization that we \nhave to do internally to to run more \nprofitable on the V8 cloud service than \nthan what the user should ultimately end \nup carrying about \nyeah and it is of course use case \nspecific right like what is the cost of \na true of a false negative right so so \nbasically like you know the fact that \nlike there was something in the result \nset that you know the the a n algorithm \ndidn't find right and it's it's going to \nbe very high for search right like you \nknow if users searching for something \nand you don't find it like that's kind \nof a bad experience right for \nrecommendations like not so much right \nlike it if you're just making a \nrecommendation if you want to recommend \nlike you know 20 tracks you know to \nsomeone at Spotify and it turns out like \nactually you know if you have done an \nexhaustive search you know that you know \nthe 21st track wouldn't have been there \nbecause it would have been another track \nLike No One's Gonna notice right so I \nthink it's extremely you know so for \nmaybe like recommendations like you \ndon't have to go to like you know 99.9 \nmaybe it's fine to go to like 95th \npercentile like I don't know \nright and and that's you know those are \nthe trails you have to think about \nyeah yeah great point \nyeah yeah and I think also you should \ntake into account how good is your model \nactually at predicting like even if you \nhave 100 recall that doesn't mean that \nthat from a user's perspective the the \nmatch is good if the model just created \nbad and Bendix basically like it could \nbe the the true nearest neighbor but \njust yeah it was just the wrong \nembedding basically \nyeah and I also wonder to what extent \nyou know people then end up like you \nknow doing sort of a multi-stage \nre-ranking anyway like at Spotify what \nwe ended up doing was we actually had an \nensemble method although I think they \nchanged that later \nuh but but so what we would do was we \nactually had not just one vector model \nbut we had you know I don't know half a \ndozen Vector model plus a bunch of other \nstuff and and so what we would do is \nlike we would use each of these Vector \nmodels uh you know to search for \ncandidates and so if we you know if we \nhad to generate 100 recommendations from \nuser we would ask you know each Vector \nmodel like give me a thousand that you \nknow tracks right and then we'd pull \nthem and then we end up with like 5 000 \ntracks and then we would you know we \nbasically re-rank it using an XT boost \nuh gradient boosted decision tree based \non a bunch of other features too uh uh \nthat that you know all kinds of like you \nknow some of them are like not at all \nlike collaborative filtering Vector \nbased like someone that were just like \nis it Christmas then you know we should \nboost crisp like there's like all these \nlike you know weird features right and \nthen we would re-rank based on that and \nand and I think \nI don't know I think it depends on the \nuse case like I think you know sort of \nadvanced you know the companies machine \nlearning practitioners like Spotify or \nyou know larger like e-commerce \napplications I think they're always \ngoing to have this like multi-stage \napproach \num but of course like you know for a lot \nof like early stage startups or a lot of \nyou know \ncustomers that don't have you know a \nwhole machine learning department they \nmight just want to take the the output \nfrom the embeddings and just return that \nto a customer and I think that's going \nto be good enough in many cases \nyeah or do some some minimal kind of \nre-ranking with them so for example then \nwe're we're getting in the direction of \nhybrid search where um so for for our \nlisteners hybrid search is basically the \nthe idea that if we're in the context of \ntext you have your dense Vector model \nthat basically yeah creates your your \nvector embeddings but you also have \ntraditional search so to speak so bm25 \nbm25f these kind of algorithms that um \nboost keywords or boost keyword matches \nor phrase matches Etc and um yeah with \nhybrid search the idea is to to combine \nboth of them and um combining can be \nindependent combining could mean that \nyou do some sort of minimal get \nre-ranking or boosting based on on \nkeywords based in like do the vector \nsearch for Bluestone keywords or do it \nthe other way around \num and um that can already also help \nbasically overcome limitations of either \nthe a n algorithm if the recall isn't \nhigh enough or the model so \na text model standard Transformer models \nfor example they perform pretty bad out \nof domain for for exact matches so that \nis something that can be overcome with \nwith hybrid search and there I think \nwe're also trying to to Really lower the \nbarriers of Entry \num for yeah as you said for for like \nsmaller startups that don't have a whole \nAI Department working on this by making \nthis easier and easier with with bb8 \nyeah totally and I'm kind of curious \nabout like the evolution I mean this may \nbe a side topic but like I feel like you \nknow 10 years ago like you know you \nwould just start with like you know \nsomething like elastic doing like \ninverted indexes and that would be like \nyou know you would productionize that \nand then you would have search right and \nthen you know \nnow today it feels like okay you start \nwith like maybe you know inverted \nindexes or you start with Vector \ndatabases and then at some point you \nknow you start adding features and you \nstart breaking it up into like a \nmulti-stage pipeline you have like both \nvector and you know inverted indexes \nworking conjunction then you throw in a \nbunch of other features too and then you \nthrow it like you know throw in like \nextra boost on top of that or whatever \nand you know you have this like you know \nthree four stages of you know candidate \ngeneration candidate re-ranking \nfiltering right like I I'm kind of \ncurious uh you know what do you see in \nthe world like you know of search and \nrelevance today is that sort of an \naccurate way to think about it \noh yeah absolutely absolutely and I \nthink you have all stages basically you \nhave companies doing just one stage two \nstage you have multiple stages like we \nhave use cases where we're from our \nperspective as semi basically we don't \neven see what's happening like all we \nknow is the customer tells us well we \nuse VBA for Canada generation and then \nwe have that that kind of Pipeline on \ntop of it and of course that that is \nsomething that's that's specific to them \nand and probably we're all there magic \nis happening and something that they're \nnot going to be very vocal about because \nthat's that's kind of their their secret \nsauce so yeah sometimes we as the \ndatabase provider as the vector search \nprovider we only see that that first \nstage the candidate generation stage \num but even in the candidates generation \nstage I think we can so so for example \nwith hybrid search we can incorporate \nlike a bid more on on of that part and \nwho knows maybe uh later on it could be \neven even higher if you could do four \nstage ranking or or search with \nyeah I think that makes sense because \nlike if I think you know users will \ngenerally start with something that you \nknow does that the simple thing the sort \nof you know pure Vector approach right \nbut like you know over time you know has \nto get more and more advanced like you \nknow it's sort of nice to sort of offer \nthose things too like as to start to \nthink about you know re-ranking and and \nyou know multi-stage pipelines \num I think like offering that you know \nas a black box or not not actually as a \nblack box but like it's kind of a gray \nbox like you know you can feed some data \ninto it but you know 100 sure how it \nworks and to me that makes a lot of \nsense as a product \nyeah one one uh sort of two-stage uh \npipeline approach that we we've actually \nhad for a while but I keep forgetting \nthat it's a two-stage approach is that \nthe question answer extraction that you \ncan do with VBA where basically you just \nhave the the dense or whatever a search \nyou use as as candidate retrieval and \nbasically use the the question answer \nextraction model that also returns a \nscore as a re-rank step or even if you \neven if you don't do the re-ranking just \nto extract the the uh the kind of \ninformation from that text method that's \na very simple but it's also a two-stage \nkind of pipeline that you can also do \nout of the box basically with uv8 yeah \nthanks a lot says at Spotify an \nincredibly important uh \nsort of one station felt in the pipeline \nwas was just like removing tracks that \nthe user had already listened to which \nkind of makes sense like if you're \nrecommending music you obviously don't \nwant to recommend tracks the users \nalready listened to so so that was the \nlast step in the pipeline we basically \nused Bloom filters for that uh because \nit's very space efficient uh so we would \nrecompute Bloom filters every night and \nthen use those as sort of binary \nrepresentations and to filter out the \ncandidates very quickly \nso we didn't have to so it actually was \nat the last stage we would we would \ngenerate candidates remove everything \nthat was already in the bloom filter and \nthen and then re-rank the resulting ones \nand Bloom filter also has uh false \nnegatives right like Bloom filters but \noccasionally uh flag something as \nbelonging in the I guess you should call \nit false positive but from the uses \npoint of it turns into false negative \nthey will they will sometimes think that \nyou know sometimes because the bloom \nfilter has is approximate we would think \nthat okay the user had already listened \nto this track but actually they didn't \nit was just like a false positive so we \nwould then remove that turning it to \nfalse negative where the user wouldn't \nactually get that recommendation because \nyou know the bloom filter thought that \nthe user already had listened to it but \nyeah I mean I'm just like mentioning as \nlike you know sort of one example of \nlike you know one stage in this like \nmulti-stage pipeline I'm talking about \nand I think everyone everyone's pipeline \nwill look a little bit different \ndepending on the use case yeah yeah when \nyou think of of stages it always sounds \nlike super complex but can be something \nsuper simple is that what I really like \nis that you're essentially using \ndatabase technology there are plenty of \nloom filters in in vva just for the the \nobject store which is an LSM based store \nand and super cool that you were yeah \nusing using Bloom filters there as well \num so what I find super interesting \nabout removing this in the last part \num if I understand it correctly that is \nessentially a post-filtering step so in \nthe worst case you could run into a \nsituation where you would run out of \ncandidates like if the if the user has \nlistened to everything then everything \nwould be removed from the search yeah so \nthat that's another a situation where \nwhere I think the the pre-filtering that \nyou can do in bb8 would be super helpful \nthese days because you can just remove \nthem before generating the candidates \nyeah I don't know if that was in \npractice I think it's in theory would \nwas a problem at Spotify but in practice \nwe generated so many candidates that it \nkind of we I mean we were generated like \n10 000 candidates for every user right \nlike plus you know and do that you know \ntimes like a number of different models \nthat were all Vector based so so in the \nend like pooling those like we're gonna \nend up with like 20 30 000 candidates \nand then we rank them first like filter \nout using blue filter then re-rank them \nright uh so I think in practice like for \nyou know occasionally they would end up \nwith like you know maybe one less \nrecommendation but but I think in almost \nevery case like we had it more than \nplanning \nyeah great example of basically you need \nto do whatever is right for your use \ncase I could imagine search cases where \nthat would be very problematic \nyeah thank you so much for joining \nlooking at the time to see where we're \napproaching our our end this was super \nfun super super nice to hear yeah here \nyeah hear about Spotify and Noy hear \nabout \num yeah a n benchmarks and then of \ncourse about modals so do check out \nmodal as we heard you can't register yet \nbut you get well you can register for \nthe for the wait list right so do do \nthat and uh check out VBA as well if \nyou've if maybe Eric was the reason you \ngot here and not not deviate if you \nhaven't heard of vb8 then check out that \nas well check out our other videos and \nuh yeah thank you so much for for coming \nhad a great time \nyeah \nsomeone's going to talk about this stuff \nthanks so
