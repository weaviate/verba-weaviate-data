{"text": "ANN Benchmarks are a tool for evaluating the performance of in-memory approximate nearest neighbor algorithms. Etienne ... \n[Music] \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching the we va podcast we have such \nan exciting podcast today eddie and \ndilocker is coming on the show again to \ntalk about a n benchmarks approximate \nnearest neighbor benchmarks and how you \ncan find the optimal parameters for \nwev8's implementation of h sw so to take \na quick step back before diving into it \nat the high level idea with the we v8 \nvector search engine we're looking at \nhow we can encode objects into vector \nrepresentations and then once we have \nthese vector representations you say \ntake your search query similarly embed \nit into a vector space and then you want \nto find the most similar vector and \none of the parts about this that makes \nit so interesting is once you talk about \nbillions of vectors and like an \nabsolutely enormous amount of vectors to \ndo that similarity search with and \nthat's where this thing about \napproximate nearest neighbor \nbenchmarks and algorithms like h and sw \ncome into the picture because they let \nyou do this in a reasonable amount of \ntime find the most similar vector in a \nabsolutely enormous collection of \nvectors if you're talking about you know \nlike all the tweets on twitter or \njust like i'm sure that people out there \ncan imagine absolutely enormous amounts \nof objects that you'd want to search \nthrough so eddie and thank you so much \nfor uh coming back on the vva podcast \nand can you uh tell us about the a n \nbenchmarks \nthanks for for having me it's been quite \na while i think that i've been here uh \nso very happy to to be back uh yeah the \nbenchmarks i think is probably the most \nrequested well feature is not a feature \ni guess in vb8 but one of the most \nrequested topics overall from from a \nmultitude of directions so new users \nmight be worried if i'm using vv8 can it \nhandle the load \nthat i would receive in in production uh \nusers evaluating different vector search \nengines might be wondering okay this is \nhow how quick or fast is it um and and \nall that we had before was basically \nthis like very vague claim that you can \ndo a a vector surge in in considerably \nless than 100 milliseconds and that's \nsort of if if we look at the benchmarks \nthat we just released like i think maybe \nwe were a bit too modest with that claim \nbecause i think that's that's typically \nthe the search latencies are much better \num \nbut really benchmarking like it's such a \ncomplex topic and i think you can't put \nit in like a single statement of saying \nlike yes you need to put some number \nsomewhere on the website like you need \nto get people the impression okay uh \nspeed and throughput is a concern for us \nand i think that was the the initial \nidea of just having something like that \nin our in our github uh readme \num but yes the benchmark show right now \nit's it's such an interesting topic with \ndifferent latencies and and how like \nlatency and throughput the connection \nbetween those two um then of course data \nset sizes uh vector dimensions like all \nof these things have an influence on on \num \nwhat you can see \nand yeah i think it's it's it's super \nexciting because vv8 is is fast i think \nwe're we're sort of \ndefinitely in a very good state with our \nperformance and why not be super \nsuper vocal about it why not show what \nwe can do and not just make these like \nvague claims like yes it's fast but \nwe're not going to tell you how fast \nokay so can we maybe step through the \ncomplexity of what makes each different \ndata set so you know say you have uh a \nbillion paragraphs from wikipedia that \nhave been encoded compared to i don't \nknow a billion images or like what what \nare the different things with respect to \neach of the data sets when you're trying \nto benchmark an approximate nearest \nneighbor search \nyeah uh yeah so if we if we look at um \nthe current benchmarks what we see is \nsort of an and what i would have assumed \nbefore is size is the different the the \nmost important factor like i would have \nassumed sort of without any context um \nmaybe that let's say if you have \nsomething that's a hundred thousand \nobjects and you have a million object \nyou would think that the million object \nones is considerably slower and if you \nbrute force this which has a basically \nuh \no of n complexity like linear complexity \nthat would absolutely be true like a \nproof for a search through a million \nobjects would be roughly ten times as \nslow as uh \none through a hundred thousand objects \nuh but of course we're using a n uh uh \nindices like in our case h and sw and \nwe've talked um at least twice i think \none in once initially and once also with \nuh yuri on the show we've talked about \nhnsw and the whole point of like this \nthis complex graph structure that hnsw \nis the whole point of it is really that \nwe don't have that linear um \nkind of kind of a latency increase or or \num \nyeah throughput decrease however you \nwant to see it \nand um it should have been really \nobvious saying that now it should have \nbeen really obvious that data set size \nisn't the biggest factor but it's still \nit's nice to see it and it's it's in a \nsense um \nyeah \nit shouldn't be surprising but it still \nkind of is and it's nice to to see that \nso um \nthat is i think the \na very interesting learning uh also when \napplying this to different data sets um \nwhen users in the community tell us \nsomething about their data set i think \nthe first thing that they would mention \nis how many objects it has and \nit's it's actually for performance it \nmight not be that relevant it might be \nrelevant for like resource planning and \nfor for cost estimates and these kind of \nthings but for performance what we see \num \nyou can generally get the highest \nthroughput um two things have the the \nbiggest impact one is the vector \ndimensionality and i think this also \nrelates a bit to your question about \nlet's say these are paragraphs from \nwikipedia or maybe these are images \ndepending on the model used um different \nmodels use different dimensionality and \ntraditionally i'm not sure if this is \ntrue anymore but traditionally we would \nsee that like text based models have \nrather few dimensions so maybe like 384 \non on something like uh center \ntransformers \num and image based ones would have very \nhigh dimensional analytics so 1024 \ndimensions for example and this would \nactually be the biggest impact uh um \nthat you could have in on performance \nand if we were diving a bit into \nhow hmsw works and and what's happening \nis the approximate uh part basically \ntells you \nuh the index does something smart so to \nspeak that you don't have to evaluate \nthe entire index it's a neighborhood \ngraph so \nby using this a n model that that agents \nw has \nit basically tells you here is a smart \nway to only evaluate let's say five \npercent of the index because these five \npercent are close to uh to your search \nquery um \nand \nwhat \nuh sorry if we if we do this we we can \nkind of see why it doesn't matter so \nmuch if we're if we're evaluating out of \na hundred thousand objects or out of a \nmillion objects because this five \npercent of course is made up number like \nit could be that in in a million objects \nsuddenly we're only evaluating maybe 0.5 \nhowever the dimensionality of the vector \nis something like if you've narrowed \nthis down to making this up let's say a \nhundred thousand vector comparisons then \nyou really see that the cost of doing a \nhundred thousand vector comparisons with \na thousand and twenty four dimensions \nis higher than doing it with 384 \num that said i'm not sure if this this \nsort of text is low dimensional and an \nimage is high dimensional that's still \ntrue because for example we're seeing \nclip and then clip um it's the same \nvector space so so we're it seems to be \nvery possible to to compress that uh \nimage information in a in a relatively \nlow dimensional vector space \num but i think it is something to to \nthink about just in general like \nif users or if users are using out of \nthe box models then it's something to \nthink about like do i really need the \none that has such high dimensionality \ncould i maybe achieve the same thing \nwith with a lower dimensionality and \nsame thing for if users are training \ntheir own models \njust think about think about the \ndimensionality like do you really need \num maybe even 384 which seems to be like \nthe sweet spot right now for text like \nhow much performance drop would you have \nif you cut that in half because the the \nthe sort of benefits that you would get \nfrom an engineering perspective is half \nthe memory potentially half it's not \nentirely linear but potentially half the \nthe latency like double the throughput \nof course it's not not yeah not linear \nin that aspect but still you're going to \nget better throughput and better uh \nlatency so \nuh yeah that's maybe maybe a long answer \nto your question about different data \nsets like really think about the \ndimensionality of your data set and if \nyou actually need it or if you can maybe \nget a free speed up by by reducing it \nyeah quickly the the idea of like how \nmuch can you compress into the vectors \nit kind of reminds me of arguments \naround like you know is intelligence \ncompression \nlike is being able to find the minimum \ndescription length of a program is that \nthe ultimate way of uh having \nintelligence and and you know that 384 \ndimension thing is so interesting and uh \nso quickly i i did later in the podcast \ni want to go a little more into binary \npassage retrieval and i remember our \nbroadcast with yuri malkov and hearing \nabout product quantization and you know \nstarting to get a taste of that and i \nmaybe i want to quickly bring up again \nlocality sensitive hashing and kind of \nhow with the problems with that i guess \nit's not because it's not learnable is \nwhat i had taken away from you or you \nknow we could uh rehash that out a \nlittle bit on the podcast a little more \nand then that maybe knowledge \ndistillation to try to compress that but \nbut kind of what i wanted to step back \ninto is so i'm i'm a wee v8 user and and \ni'm coming to these benchmarks \nso is it the dimensionality of the \nvectors again the so it sounds like the \napproximate nearest neighbor data \nstructure structures like you know hnsw \nand i really enjoyed uh eric bernardson \nhas a blog post series on explaining how \nannoy works and i highly recommend that \nto listeners who are \nyou know not who are still getting \ncaught up as a way of understanding how \nthe data structures divide the space but \nso for a new wev8 user coming to the new \nbenchmarks webpage is that is the \ndimensionality of the vectors is that \nthe key thing that they should look at \nto compare the benchmarks with their \ndata set or is there more to it than \nthat \nuh \nyes yes and no so um i think it's one of \nthe learnings that i did um but i think \nthat the great thing about this \nbenchmark page is it's \nit tends to be it's basically just \ninformation and you can interpret in in \nwhatever way you want and that's also \nwhy we use different data sets in the \nbenchmark so that you could pick the one \nthat represents your use case uh or \nclosest and that that gives you i mean \nthat can help you in different stages \nbasically it could be uh prior to using \nvva to know what you could expect from \nvv8 but it could even be helpful in like \na debugging scenario let's say um you're \nusing vv8 and you're not getting the \nkind of performance that you would \nexpect \nby picking the the \ndata set that's closest to yours from \nthe benchmark list you could say okay \nlike they were using this specific \nmachine they were using uh this many \nobjects with this many vector dimensions \nand they were getting i don't know \nmaking this up 5 000 queries per second \nthroughput i'm only getting 500 then you \nhave a very good indication that \nsomewhere in in that setup something is \ngoing wrong and then of course the super \ninteresting question is like where is it \ngoing wrong but i think \nuh debugging something is much easier if \nyou know \nthat you can expect more from it than if \nyou're if you're not sure like if you're \nsaying like this kind of like of the gut \nfeeling it's it's not as fast as it \ncould be but what is reasonable and i \nthink that is one of the the questions \nthat we also really wanted to answer \nwith those benchmarks um \ngiven these things so so two two \nquestions basically given these \nparameters this is what you can expect \nand then the second question is by \ncomparing the different data sets to one \nanother changing these kind of \nparameters \nwhat what would change and and there \nyeah as i said before one of the biggest \nlearnings for me was the that the vector \ndimensionality is a much \nmore impactful than the data set size \nwould it be useful to maybe look at like \na histogram of distances between \nmaybe you sample five queries and then \nyou plot the histogram where say it's \nlike a gaussian looking thing of you \nknow what the average distances are to \nthe data set would that kind of thing \nimpact the hsw parameters uh yes you are \nuh raising something super interesting \num because i i think i'm not sure if \nyou're if you're referring to that but \nit matches perfectly that uh twitter \nthreat that we saw from from niels \nreimers about \na sort of distribution of vector \nof vector points in the space and he was \ndoing that in in the context of using \nrandom vectors and if you use random \nvectors \nbasically by definition they'll be \nevenly distributed there's like every \nthere's there's no reason that there \nshould be clusters or there's no reason \nthat um yeah objects are relatively far \nfrom one another so you see that that \ndistribution curve um where basically \neverything is close and the problem in a \nneighborhood graph is we i think we \ninitially talked about this when we we \ntalked about agents w like it it's based \non that fact um that \nif you let's say you want to want to \nmake a connection from uh someone in \nflorida usa to frankfurt germany um then \nin the best case you might just only \nhave to know one person but that person \nknows someone there so and this is i \nthink the the the more common example is \num you're just five or six hops or any \nperson on earth is five or six \nconnections away from from knowing \nbarack obama or any other uh famous \nperson in the world \num and that only holds true \nif some of those distances are actually \nlarge like if if \nlet's say i know my neighbor and my \nneighbor i mean physical neighbor and my \nneighbor knows someone else in the same \ncity and they know someone else in the \nsame city then i can do 10 hops and i'm \nnot anywhere closer from frankfurt to \nto florida \nso it kind of depends on that \nthat distribution of objects of having \nsort of long enough edges so to speak \nbecause it's a graph \nand \nthat is the problem that if you do um if \nyou use random vectors \nall distances are going to be equal so \nhow do you sort of move in the right \ndirection \nwhere it's closest to you but still far \nenough that you're actually jumping uh \nenough distance and there the the super \ninteresting learning is that if you use \nan actual data set you kind of get that \nnaturally like you're you're not \nengineering your data set to be \nsort of i don't know to have clusters \nand have large distances between \nclusters it's just something that \nhappens like whatever data set you you \ntake um if it's if it's images \nthere's bound to be some clustering if \nit's text there's bound to be some some \nclustering um so simply by using like \nin a sense it's simpler than random \nbecause you feel like maybe i need to \nengineer this in a specific way where \nthe distances are are under control but \nironically just not doing that and just \nusing \nactual data that somehow has a has a \nmeaning on it gives you that perfect \ndistribution that that works so well \nwith these a n indices \nby the way also other ones like not not \njust agents w i think is a is a famous \nexample one but if we think of um \nfor example ivf so so the inverted file \none um same idea basically you you start \npartitioning your data set into clusters \nand then ideally if your search query \ncan be answered by a single cluster you \ncan skip the others but exactly the same \nproblem here like if you think of of a \ntwo-dimensional space where points are \ncompletely evenly distributed so you \nhave like almost like a checkerboard \npattern or something where the points \nare basically where the lines intersect \nhow do you cluster that like is it \nviable to put that into one cluster that \nmatches everything well yes but then you \ndon't have the benefits of cluster if \nyou do four clusters \nwhere do you draw the lines like every \ncombination is basically equally as good \nwhereas um if these natural like if you \nhave this natural clustering uh that's \nwhere these these algorithms um \nreally benefit from and yeah that was \ninteresting to also to also see that \nlike you can um if you run \num with with random vectors as opposed \nto like keep all the the the data uh the \nsame as on an actual data set and \nbasically try to copy that with random \nvectors you can actually get the same \nkind of speed and throughput but at a \nvery very bad recall and um then just \nusing the actual \nbecause and and that's specific to \nagents w because h w at some point it \njust stops the search when it thinks \nit's it's covered it well enough and uh \nthe fact is basically that well enough \nis just way way worse so i think \nsomething uh might be making this up but \non on like one million objects of 120 \na.d i think the difference that we could \nsee something like 20 recall with the \nsame parameters where you would get \n97 recall \nwithin with an actual data set \ninteresting so so \nto recover that would instead of random \nvectors where i guess like the random \nprior is that it's going to be \nnormally distributed evenly spaced out \nif you had um you know algorithmically \ngenerated vectors that but the \nrandomness came from like a gaussian \nprior or bimodal gaussian prior \ni'm now going to reveal that i don't \nremember too many probability \ndistributions but i think like poisson \nthere's like other distributions right \nlike would that kind of way of \nalgorithmically generating vectors \nrecover the properties of real world \ndata sets \ni i think yes like i i don't know why \nsomeone would go through that effort but \ni think like assuming that there is a \nway that you could randomly generate \ndata \nthat maybe even through training \nsomething that is trained to reproduce \nrandom data that sort of matches the \ndistribution of something that exists i \ni think you could get there \num but in the context of benchmarking i \nthink it's much easier to just use a \nstandard data set basically \nyeah and i'd really like to talk a \nlittle more about uh clustering i think \nso clustering is the key thing here \nright like the the just the \nrepresentations of these vectors are \nclustered and so the algorithms exploit \ncluster structure in order to \nfacilitate faster search \nand clustering is also kind of i'd read \nan interesting paper that something like \nlearning to classify without labels \nwhere \nyou basically assign semantic categories \nto clusters and you use that to classify \nuh d do you see that as um and i know \nalso wev8 has a zero shot classification \nbuilt built into it as well how do you \nsee that like idea of um \nyou know \nlike maybe to provide a little more \ncontext is i'm in i'm looking into this \nidea of doing the twitter analytics with \nweaviate and so what i'm trying to do is \ncombine like the usual descriptive \nstatistics where you look at uh \nbasically segmenting where you kind of \ntry to like look at the view count and \nthe engagement rate and you try to look \nat the the way that these two symbolic \nproperties are distributed and now i'm \ntrying to add this semantic component \nor you can cement you can segment by the \nsemantic clusters to to do that kind of \nsegmenting that data scientists kind of \ndo so maybe this question i hope it \nisn't too broad but how do you think \nabout that idea of \nclustering to form semantic categories \nand how that might differ from kind of \nthe school of thought around \nsymbolically labeling things and then \nfitting classifiers to them to form \ncategories yeah \nyeah yeah i think \nit sounds like you're pitching a new \ncustom module for vb8 so that's that's \nreal good yes and i think um \nthe only step really that we need \nbecause if we naturally have those \nclusters and we can discover those \nclusters those clusters basically have a \na centroid point or a centroid vector \nthat represents the cluster so really \nthe only thing that we need to do is \njump from that centroid to something \nthat can sort of classify it in a way so \nif we think of the the \ncontextionary module that we have which \nis very primitive \nkind of it's not a deep learning model \nor maybe there's deep learning involved \nin the training but in the way that we \napply it it's essentially just a lookup \nlist for words and and vectors \nand by having such a simple mechanism \nyou can easily do it the other way \naround if you have like this might might \nbe a viable option if you already have \nsome data just calculate the centroid \nvector and just ask the contextionary \nassuming it's in the same vector space \nof course as the conjecture be like what \nare the nearest words that you know off \nin that \nin that space and then if we \nand that could be something like the \nlabel or or something such more complex \nand then if we think of deep learning \nmodels \num and and you probably know this way \nbetter than i do but i could imagine \nthat that's not too different from \ngenerator models right like if a if i \ndon't know you have something like a \ntext summarizer i i could imagine that \nyou could tweak that in a way where you \njust give it an input vector and tell it \nto to i don't know create a label or \nsomething so basically text to vec in in \nthe opposite way like back to text that \nshould be doable right \nand yeah i've been i mean i'm pretty \nobsessed with this idea of prompting and \nhow the t5 texas text transfer \ntransformer shows that you can kind of \nunify all the tasks into language \nmodeling \nand uh so yeah that idea of uh \nclassifying it like zero shot by having \nthe kind of prompting interface and so \ni've been really curious about uh \nrecommendation and that kind of thing \nand maybe do you think that \nrecommendation could be also put into \nthat language modeling framework where \nthe prompt is um you know \nsay i'm recommending movies and so i \nwould say uh \nthe the user is eddie and dilocker he \nlikes \ndogs and and wine say \nand you use that as the input \nrepresentation like the prompt and then \nand then it like well so and then it the \nprompt then it goes like so what movies \ndo you think eddie and like eddie and \nliked iron man \nlike the history of the how they do the \nrecommendation and then you just turn it \ninto a language modeling problem where \nyou \ngenerate the kind of next movie do you \nthink that kind of thing would work or \nit's probably too grandiose of a way of \nformatting the task \nnow that i i i think that could \nabsolutely work because what i know or i \nsort of have to build this base on what \ni know is that um we see users using \nvector search as the first step of the \nrecommendation pipeline where they use \nvector search basically just to generate \ncandidates and then have some other \nlogic \nto to um sort of base \nlike let's say staying with the movie \nexample um we're taking the last movies \nthat i've watched and then we're now \nlooking for for something that's in some \nway related and related i think doesn't \nnecessarily have to mean like because \nthis was a comedy this has to be a \ncomedy but it could be could be anything \nand and then \nsort of to to have yeah these other \ninputs in there as well i think i could \nabsolutely see that sort of \nas yeah something that you would either \ndo through through re-ranking which is \nbasically what our users are already \ndoing by applying their \nml logic on on something that's \nthat's originally a vector search or \nmaybe even by by building this into the \nmodel itself basically that yeah the \nsimilarity search wouldn't necessarily \nreturn something that's similar but \nwould return something \nthat \nyeah maybe is similar in the sense of \nthe user likes this therefore they also \nlike this so where the the vectors page \nwith space would maybe not so much \nrepresent um \nthe the \nin the case of movies like the movies \nbut maybe the users where you then \nsearch for similar users or make these \nthese these kind of jumps in that space \nyeah one paper i really liked is uh it's \na doctor query and what they do is they \nrun a a model that predicts a question \ngiven a document so it takes the \ndocument as input generates a question \nand then what it will put into the \nvector database is that pair of \ngenerated question and then the document \nso it's kind of like a way of adapting \nit to question answering because then \nyou kind of have that like lexical \nsimilarity sort of with the style of \nasking a question so yeah i'm curious \nabout that idea of \nadding prompts to queries maybe to to \nhave it go into the space and and then \nmaybe the particular application \nrecommendation but \nmaybe to step out a little bit i'm i'm \nvery curious about re-ranking it looks \nlike there's quite a few ways to think \nabout re-ranking and i'd like to start \nwith uh you know i know you implemented \nbinary passage retrieval and really got \ninto the details of that i'd like to \ntalk about that idea of maybe a coarse \ngrain stage one retrieval and then a \nmore fine-grained stage two retrieval \nand whether just with binary passage \nretrieval as the coarse grain step and \nthen maybe just re retaining the \nfloating point values of say the top 5 \n000 retrieved uh candidates and then \nhaving \nit maybe like a brute force search \nwithin that second stage or some other \nthing how do you think about these like \nmulti-stage refining pipelines maybe \nyeah yeah i think there's almost no way \naround them because \nif you so so bpr i think is or the \nmotivation behind bpr is basically \nuh performance and or sort of memory \ncosts by by uh originally searching \nthrough these compressed vectors um \nthe goal is then to to yeah sort of have \na smaller vector space and therefore \nsmaller resource requirements um and \nthen the re-ranking is only to get back \nto the original quality um but i think \nre-ranking has much more potential than \njust sort of uh \nyeah sort of improving upon the loss of \nof compression \nby producing something that's actually \nbetter and like in the simplest sense \ncould be for example re-ranking uh \nbased on keyword matching so so let's \nsay you have a \nuh event so the typical problem here of \nthese pre-trained for example sentence \ntransformer models is \nthey are great on general purpose data \nbut the closer that you move to um \ndomain-specific data that they haven't \nbeen trained on \nthe worse they become one way of course \nis to \nfine-tune them but that's maybe not \nalways an option so for example if \nsomeone who's not \nfrom the ml space just wants an \nout-of-the-box solution that works \nokayish then fine-tuning may not be an \noption because they've maybe never \ntrained the model before and don't even \nwant to want to get into that \nand then let's say we have a case where \nwe have a model that's generally quite \nokay so let's say \ne-commerce \nyou search for for a brand name and like \nwinner \napparel or something and then it might \nbe really good to to make that \nconnection from like winter apparel to \nlet's say a jacket \num but it's it's very bad at matching \nthat to the brand name that was actually \nin there so let's say you have nike \nadidas whatever in the search query and \nthen the model almost ignores that uh so \nif the original candidate selection was \ngood enough \nthen you could even re-rank this with \nsomething super primitive such as bm25 \nwhich is basically just keyword matching \nuh \nthe the problem here is of course if \nthose matches weren't in there like if \nyou you can only ever re-rank basically \nwhat was already matched so i think you \nneed to be in a situation where the \nmatches were good enough but you maybe \ndon't necessarily agree with the order \nso like the i don't know top 200 ones \nare good \nbut you can really only recommend one \nout of those top 200 and you don't agree \nwith with the order within those top 200 \nand i think that's where re-ranking \nreally shines yeah that's a really \ninteresting flow of um you have say the \nthe wikipedia sentence trained sentence \ntransformer that can do like pretty you \nknow semantics similarity cover a pretty \nmassive distribution of text and then \nonce you get like the top 5000 now you \nhave the bm25 lexical style re-ranking \nwhich what are the you know like because \nyou want the exact term and we talk \nabout things like serendipitous \ndiscovery with respect to how people \nreally interpret what's returned from a \nvector search engine and that kind of \nfuzzy distance and that makes a lot of \nsense to me and i'm also thinking about \nthis idea of say pairwise classifiers \nand personalization so we have um you \nknow eddie and connor and we're \nrecommending movies would we have you \nknow we could re-rank this list by \nhaving some kind of label data set where \nwe have \npairs of movies eddie and chooses movie \na then you know we show eddie in movie c \neddie and chooses movie e and then you \nuse the pairwise thing to do the \nre-ranking what do you think about that \nkind of approach to it \nyeah just i i really i think the the the \ngreat way of reranking is that you can \nre-rank on on anything really like if \nyou have the initial list um \nanything basically that you can train \nsomething on i think that's that's you \nyou can re-rank based on it and maybe \neven \nto go outside of the the space of um \nof machine learning itself it could also \njust be some simple business logic let's \nsay to sort of stick with the e-commerce \nexample again \nit might be that the shop is not \nnecessarily interested in \nuh presenting the best match but maybe \nin what they have the highest margin on \nso it could be like that you put in \nthese these completely different where \nwe tell the the the um out of the box uh \nyeah trained on wikipedia data like how \nis that model supposed to know that if \nthey sell let's say nike over adidas \nthat they get a higher margin um but \nthrough re-ranking i think you can \nreally sort of yeah put potentially in \nand whether this is this could be \nsomething as simple as if brand equals \nnike then plus two or something or it \ncould be like this complex model that's \nbasically learned that um yeah if we \nsell nike shoes in summer then um \nour \nbottom line sort of improves and um that \ndeviates a bit from your original \nquestion about pairwise ranking um but i \nthink it's sort of what i want to convey \nis basically that that anything goes \nyeah that's one of my favorite things \nabout the vector search engine and we've \neaten studying weave it is the way that \nit can plug in symbolic algorithms with \nthe neural retrieval you have like \nsymbolic ordering of how you then \nprocess the neural algorithm and i love \nthe playing of those two algorithms and \ni think that's a really nice transition \nto what i wanted to talk to you about \nnext and you know i recently had the \nopportunity it was such a great time to \nattend the knowledge graph conference in \nnew york with laura and \nsee laura's presentation on question \nanswering watch the room reacting to and \nit was really just such an incredible \nexperience to see and i really wanted to \nget your perspective on semantic web \nontologies and \nunderstand how you think about these \nkind of things \nso so \nfor for me i think this this ties very \nwell into into the previous question \nbecause um \nlike i i see myself and my role a bit \nmore in \nenabling the platform to then build \nthese kind of use cases on top so so i i \ndon't think i'm an expert on knowledge \ngraphs um but i might well be an expert \non uh sort of \nproviding the platform that you need to \nsearch through through knowledge graphs \nand um \nyeah i i \ni almost like that i i don't have a good \nanswer on on the knowledge like i you \nyou were part of the knowledge craft \nconference you can tell me probably a \nlot about what was going on there and i \ni wouldn't even know so i i really like \nthis that that it's in a sense vv8 is so \nso general purpose so to speak like it's \ngood at specific things but still it's \nso so general purpose that there's such \na wide variety of like yeah from \ne-commerce to to knowledge graph to to \nmove your recommendation it's like \nalmost feels like the base of anything \nthat you want to do in in that space in \nthe future \nyeah the the class property design of \nwva where you can have these cross \nreferences between different classes i'm \nstarting to see how kind of like i \nperceive as elegant this abstraction is \nthat i've seen like in our we've eight \nslack uh someone had asked you know how \ndo i encode multiple languages and bob \nhad responded you could have a cross \ncross-reference that links between the \ntwo languages as different classes so i \nsee that as a way to do say like \nmultimodal image text where you can \nhave a cross-reference to the other \nimage as well as this kind of ontology \nrelation style where you say \nuh connor is an employee of semi \ntechnologies uh is \nuh uh is a business category vector \nsergeant \nyou know like these this kind of way of \nrelation style i think it's such an \ninteresting thing and then within each \nthing you have these uh h sw index \nstructures within each class so kind of \nlike a quick clarifying question so each \nclass gets gets a approximate nearest \nneighbor \ndata structure correct correct so that \nthe class is essentially like a \nnamespace or in in my sql world i think \nit's called databases so where you have \nthe whole database and you have \nindividual databases and \num yeah in kubernetes you would call it \na namespace um so yeah it's really the \nthe unit of isolation basically \num \nso so what so in one we've eight \ninstance i could have say three h and sw \nindexes for the three \nvery cool yeah i think that's such an \ninteresting part of it and \ndoing that kind of linking uh is really \njust one of the topics that is \ninteresting to me the most right now \ndefinitely \nand um so so maybe transitioning from \nthe uh knowledge graph thing and it's a \nbit jumping to a different topic but \nso i wanted to ask about we va custom \nmodules and if you could tell me a bit \nmore about what it takes to extend one \nof the modules with \nuh with a with it it seems like to me if \nyou want to say point to \nuh another \nsay hugging face model path you you look \nat this like python inference container \nand i'm sorry this question is kind of \ngoing around the place for our listeners \nbut maybe could you start with the \nunderstanding of wev8 core and then like \nthe python inference containers yes yes \nabsolutely so \nvb8 core in itself is a vector search \nengine basically that means vva does not \nunderstand anything but vectors and the \nthe objects that are attached to that \nvector so often called metadata i don't \nthink we use that term but it's it's \nvery commonly used in the space \nand and of course the whole object has a \nlot of complexity around it as well with \ndifferent data types but essentially the \nthe idea is that if you use vv8 without \nany modules vva doesn't actually \nunderstand how to go from let's say text \nor image or any of the those to to that \nso if you use for example the the near \ntext in the api uh you need to provide a \nmodule that \nbasically does that translation and um \nyeah \none of the ways uh to use sort of a \ncustom module i think there are \nseveral levels sort of off of \nabstraction or not not maybe of \nabstraction but of how deep in the stack \ndo you want to go to create \nsuch a a custom module and as you \nalready mentioned starting with \nsomething existing \ncan be super helpful so for example \nstarting with the we have the text \neffect transformers module and the point \nof that is basically this textvac uh \ntranslation so if you use this um all \nyour objects that you import will be \nturned into or will be vectorized and \nthe the vector will be \nstored in an index in the hmsw index um \nand the same is true at query time so \nessentially you can use vv8 like a \ntraditional search engine that supports \ntext now and of course if you add an \nimage module it would be same for for \nimage so \nwhat that does um this module is \nbasically \nit extends vvate a tiny bit um in a \nsense that it tells vba okay now you \nwill have a near text search operator \nfor example because that's that's not \npart of like it's not that it's \nthere in vv8 core but you can't use it \nand now you need a module it's just it's \njust not there if there's no module so \nthis is sort of and and this is i think \nthe the extreme strength of that module \nsystem that any new module could extend \nvba in any way that we can't even \nimagine yet and and um basically yeah \nyou have this small piece of code \nin vv8 itself i guess or closely running \nin v8 core like it would from from an \nengineering perspective would run as \npart of the same like it would be a \nplug-in that runs as part of the same \nprocess that vba is but then what that \nsmall piece of code can do is it can \njust send requests to something else so \nhere this you you mentioned the the \npytorch inference container here the \nidea is that a vector search engine has \nvery very different requirements from a \nfrom a resource and a resource and \ninfrastructure perspective than let's \nsay model inference so the idea is that \nyou split that out so basically a micro \nservice pattern we split that out and \nvva that that does vector search \ncomparison which is most likely cpu \nbound um \nmakes that network request to something \nelse which could for example run a model \nthat's running uh on a gpu like these \ndeep learning models they tend to run \nvery well on gpu or there are also \nefforts to optimize them for different \ncpus but typically they run well on on \ngpus so what you can do \nin that journey basically is i think \nthree different parts to to come up with \na custom module the first one would be \nyou take that inference container that \nexisting inference container that's \nbuilt for uh for transformer models and \nyou simply run it with a different model \nso you could let's say download a model \nfrom from hugging phase or you could \nhave a locally compiled model and as \nlong as and there there are instructions \nhow to do that uh in our documentation \nas long as you get that new model inside \nof that container you can reuse \neverything there so in a sense you could \ncall this a custom module already \nbecause it's something that wasn't there \nout of the box you have now your i don't \nknow fine-tuned model there \nthe second step is you could say \nthe use case that i want to do is the \nsame i still need text to vec \nbut my model architecture is so \ndifferent that i can't use the pie torch \ncontainer anymore so for example uh \nsomething completely new comes up some \nsome new way of of running a model or it \ncould be um maybe not something new it \ncould be like like onyx or these uh sort \nof optimized compiled models that simply \nhave a different architecture what you \ncan do in this case is say \ni want to keep the part in vva that \ncontrols the api because my api is still \ngoing to be \nfrom text to vec and i'm still using \nthis near text um \nyeah near text search parameter \nbasically but how that's done like the \nimplementation is completely replaced \nand that would be sort of at the at the \nmicro service level where we're now \nsaying we're simply replacing one \nmicroservice with another and the only \nthing that needs to match is the api as \nlong as this api contract between bb8 \nand um \nand uh the inference container is upheld \nyou can entirely replace it you can do \nwhatever you want and i think this is \nmore commonly something that people \nwould start calling a custom module \nbut then if there's a third option so \nthe third option is \nwhat if we want to for example support a \ncompletely different media type so let \nme think of one that we currently don't \nsupport so let's say audio to that you \nwant to start with audio too like that \nmeans you can't just replace the \ninference container that does text to \nvec because of course the the interface \nis yeah it takes text and you now need a \ncompletely new api you need to to get um \nanswer if that that \naudio part in it i don't know let's say \nfor the sake of argument you would just \nupload an mp3 file or something like \nthat um \nand for that you actually need to change \nthe entire chain of the module so \nbasically \nyou need to change that part that \nextends the vba api so basically the \nplug-in that runs in the same process \nand then most likely you would still run \nwith some sort of an inference container \nbut that's that's actually not part of \nthe module system that's that's \nbasically just a convention that the \nexisting modules use so you could um if \nit's not needed you could run it inside \nthe plugin directly and never have that \nsplit out microservice or you could say \nprobably a bad example for for audio to \nevent but for the sake of argument let's \nsay \nyou need three steps and you need three \ndifferent models let's say one \ni don't know one cleans the audio the \nnext one uh \nsort of cuts it into chunks and then the \nthird service actually vectorizes so \nmade up pipeline but if that was your \npipeline you could spin up three \ncontainers for example and that i think \nis really the strength of the module \nsystem that \nin the end it's just a tiny piece of of \nof plug-in code that extends the vv8 api \nand then can do whatever it wants with \nthat api and that gives you these three \nlevels basically of of hooking into it \nand integrating uh something custom into \nit \nyeah that's super i i think the \nextensibility of that is super \ninteresting and i i do think there's a \nbit to impact and i i'm really impressed \nwith the uh google summer of code \ninitiative in the we vva projects that \ni'm seeing and the titles of them sound \nkind of like this thing like the idea of \nuh you know \nmaybe just adding a new hug and face \nmodule and understanding how to do it or \nhow to add audio to vec but if we could \nif you maybe take me through you know i \nwant to add let's say i want to add a \nnew tokenizer and i want to add a new \nhugging face module would i need to \npull request text event transformers add \nin my two things and then uh and then \npush it back to the main uh github thing \nuh yeah yeah essentially if you want it \nso so the the uh sort of pushing it back \npoint would mean um that you would \nrelease it for everyone \num \nthat's one option another option would \nalso be that you have something private \nthat you don't want to release back to \nthe community so \nin either way i think you would \nuh so so for the for the first one where \nyou want to release it you would \ndefinitely have to \nfork it issue a pull request and with \nthe pull request is merged then it could \nbe available for for everyone \num if you do it privately \nuh there is sort of a \nsmoother process for this where you um \ndo this at the docker level where \nbasically when you do a docker build i \nthink there's one environment variable \nwhere you can put in the hugging phase \nuh a url string so um \nthe the uh hugging phase bundles up the \nmodel yeah the models with their their \ntokenizer and everything like under \nunder one string right that looks a bit \nlike a like a github repo and yeah \norganization and repo and if you i think \nwe have these uh docker files where you \njust put in exactly that string and if \nit exists and if it's accessible then it \nwill download it and sort of build that \nin your container um so yeah if you if \nyou don't plan on unpublishing it if you \nonly plan on using it you can even take \nthat stuff but if you want to publish it \nthen the pull request would be the right \nyeah that's so interesting for me uh \ntrying to get deeper into weaving it and \ntrying to really understand it and for \nme i'm a little scared of things like uh \ndocker files and go and i've been trying \nto just like you know roll up my sleeves \nand get into the details of it but it \ndoes feel pretty accessible the docker \ncontainers that i think there's a bit of \na learning curve for it if you're \ntotally \nnothing but i do think that it's pretty \naccessible and \nso great i think that was a really great \nuh recap of a bunch of different topics \nthat i wanted to ask you about and \nmaybe any closing thoughts on the \napproximate nearest neighbor benchmarks \nand changes to the website and helping \npeople understand uh how to configure \ntheir h sw through the use of these \nbenchmarks \nyeah i would say first of all check the \nbenchmarks that's that's the most \ninteresting thing like look at them be \nconvinced that that bb-8 can match your \nperformance goals and then share the \nbenchmarks that's of course also super \ninteresting for us \nto to spread the words um \nyeah and and uh everything in the \nbenchmark oh yeah that is something that \ni actually haven't mentioned yet \neverything in there is open source um \nour intention is that that you can \nreproduce like we're very transparent \nabout every single step that we do in \nthere we we ran those uh on a single \nmachine we ran bb-8 on a single machine \nin uh gcp that was i think a c2 standard \n30 or something it's it's in the article \num and we ran uh the benchmark script on \na separate machine which was just \nsort of best practice for for \nbenchmarking like you don't want your \nbenchmark script and your server \ncompeting for the same resource and we \nsplit that out into onto two different \nmachines um \nand uh the the repository to to import \neverything to run all the scripts uh to \nto compile everything down to uh the the \ngraphs that we're showing in the article \nall of it is open source so if you think \nwe made a mistake or if uh you think we \nwe yeah in either direction basically um \nif you think we're we're you know doing \nsomething that that shows numbers that \nare too good or we're not optimizing \nsomething um it's open source everyone \ncan contribute and i think that that \nwould be my my key message there \nyeah super cool it seems so exciting \ndeveloping all the benchmarks and having \nall the research and the science the \nreproducibility that comes out of having \nopen source reproducible benchmarks so \nthank you so much eddie and i really \nenjoyed this vba podcast i'm learning so \nmuch about we've got i really love this \ntopic and \nthings we discussed like the class \nproperty referencing i think all this is \njust so interesting \nawesome thank you thanks for having me \ntime went by very quickly
