{"text": " \n[Music] \nforeign \n[Music] \nair we have a whole crew with in here \nI've got Zen JP Conor and Erica and \nmyself of course and this episode is \ngoing to be super exciting at least it \nis for us and hopefully you'll find it \nas exciting on your side and today it's \nall about the the latest that we V8 \nrelease but also will have something \nfrom Connor towards the end about like \nwhat's new in the AI just like we did \nlast week and I think this is super \nexciting so what we would like to do \nfirst is maybe a quick introduction from \neverybody on uh on on this stream and I \nguess we can go in the order as we have \nit on the screen like so then you want \nto go first sounds good to me my name is \nAnne hessen I am a senior developer \nadvocate here at semi Technologies I'm \nbased out of a snowy and called Toronto \nCanada where getting into that \nsnowy weather hopefully soon I enjoy it \na lot of people don't enjoy it but it's \na little bit about me I'm an engineer \ndata scientist by training throwing it \noff to you JP oh this way thanks thanks \nEd \num yeah my name is JP I'm a technical \ncurriculum developer at semi I've been \nhere about a month now and it's been \nreally really exciting obviously it's my \nfirst podcast or a live video session \nhere so I'm really excited to be a part \nof this and yeah I'll be kind of shaping \na lot of the sort of educational Journey \nfor the audience who's come using uh \nweaviate for various bits and pieces of \ntheir work so I'm really excited to be \non board for the uh for the journey \nawesome I'll go next hi everyone I'm \nErica Cardenas I'm a developer advocate \nhere at semi \num I'm based out of Boston I'm nervous \nfor my first winter but I'm also looking \nforward to it and I'm excited for this \nepisode we're going to Showcase a few \ncool things \nand hey everyone I'm Connor also in \nBoston uh as they mentioned with the \nweather moved to Boston from Florida and \nwe're having our first snowy cold season \nand missing Florida a little bit but a \nresearch scientist says semi and uh been \nworking on figuring out deep learning \nand search and it's been so much fun \nperfect and I guess I'll go last uh so \nhi I'm Sebastian I am the head of \nDeborah here at the semi uh leading this \namazing team in front of you \num yeah and basically I'm all about like \nsharing everything that we are working \non and uh hopefully you all enjoy that \num so okay so what we're going to do \ntoday let me give you a quick overview \nof the overall flow and and the \nstructure uh so the idea is and I \nalready mentioned it a little bit but \nthe idea is like um yesterday we had a \nrelease of vivid 116 and we thought that \nthis is a great opportunity to pretty \nmuch share what uh we we worked on what \nwent into that but also like as a bit of \na background so as part of the whole uh \nrelease flow the team here that you see \nhere each of us had like a different uh \npart of the the new features or changes \nthat that we were involved with sharing \nuh so we we created this release blog \npost uh and and then we thought like hey \nlike why not actually uh again go in \nwith air and then talk about the \nsegments that we're writing about and \nmaybe like get into more of a \nconversation or maybe demo some of those \nfeatures uh so that's a part number one \nand then the second part again like I \nmentioned earlier I will have Conor who \nwill go over the cool things that like \nthe cool papers that he was reading \nabout uh in October so Connor I can't \nwait uh to learn more from you uh and \nyeah that's pretty much the general idea \num okay so maybe uh instead of asking \nfor volunteers I'll volunteer myself uh \nto open with the first segment so \nsomething that we did that was different \naround this release or at least since uh \nv115 uh we changed the approach in terms \nof how we are releasing patch releases \nso in the past we would be more like we \nalways had patch releases like that \nstarting new but in the past we used to \nkind of think like okay in order to \nrelease a patch release uh we would say \nlike okay let's get this and this and \nthis fix together and once that was \nready then would kind of like cut that \npatch release and then then push it but \nthen we realized that as much as this \nwas very convenient for us to kind of do \neverything like well one touch goal or \nEtc \num we realized that people had to wait \nor you had to wait basically for uh \nthese fixes or future improvements to \narrive right so uh we kind of changed \nthe focus and the idea was to kind of \nlike let's go and as soon as we have a \nfix let's publish it so that everybody \nin the community everybody that uses \nVivid have it available uh and then \nincidentally enough uh today uh Erica \nyou can probably talk about it a little \nbit \num but Erica was work you were working \non a demo right uh for for your later \nsegment and what happened yes um I \nnoticed it wasn't working I couldn't \nperform the queries that um is written \nin the documentation I was kind of going \na little crazy I'm like maybe it's an \nerror on my side but we found a small \nfix and first of all Aaron Dirk was able \nto help and he submitted then he \nsubmitted the first patch release of B16 \nso that's awesome yeah two so there you \ngo like there was like a quick bug that \nwe we discovered we should have \ndiscovered maybe a little bit earlier \nbut that that happens sometimes uh so \nthere was like a specific Edge case that \nwas actually used in Erica's demo \num but this was the really cool thing \nright like we talked to Derek in on the \nengineering side and was able to like \nImplement uh the fix and we already are \nlike yesterday we published a 160.0 \ntoday we published 16.1 so that everyone \ncan actually have a nice and working \nversion of widget which is absolutely \ngreat \num so yeah that's basically it from my \nside in terms of uh my update but I \nthink uh since we already mentioned it \nuh from from Erica about Erica then \nI think we can move to the next and \nmaybe one thing I should have done \nprobably by the way like I'm I'm such a \nrude person it's like \nthank you all for watching and taking \ntime uh because uh thanks Conor for uh \nfinding it out uh because I think it's \nreally important that you take your take \ntake the time to to join us on this \nstream uh and if you do have any \nquestions uh FYI while uh you we are \nrunning this uh this is a live show uh \nso feel free to ask any questions and \nand we'll try to answer them as we go as \nwell \num all right so I'm going to pass it on \nto Erica so Erica what do you have for \nus all right I have I will be covering \nthe two new filter uh operators \num that are part of the B16 release \nwould you mind sharing my screen and \nI've created a demo out for you guys uh \nthe first one is the um is null so \nyou'll be able to see \num where the properties are missing or \nit was set to null \num and then also you're able to filter \nby array length um so I will share a \nvisual of this just because it's always \nbetter to demo things out and then this \nis also how you find bugs \num so a little bit like a backstory how \nI created this demo and kind of why I'm \ntalking about food allergies is because \nwe are all going to Italy soon and Jesse \na wonderful head of people asked does \nanyone have allergies I think maybe like \nfive times and I don't have any \nallergies but I understand the \nimportance of it right \num so Bill Nancy and Samantha are like a \nfew people on the top they do not work \nat semi I guess I should have used our \nnames our real name Sebastian thinks I \ncan I see like dead people like I can \njust I have imagined friends \num is Bill not in the company and Nancy \nhuh I guess they're just in my \nimagination \num so yeah here we have a few people and \ntheir specific allergies so um for a few \npeople they have one but then if we \nscroll down we have Noah and Emma um so \nas you can see for Noah he is missing \nthe property completely \num but then for Emma it is set to null \num but this it will important to deviate \nthe exact same so I just want to make a \nnote if you are importing a data set \nthat is ginormous and you just don't \nhave the time to go through data \ncleaning \num this is a nice feature where you \ndon't have to make like um you don't \nhave to make sure that the property is \nsectional it could just be completely \nmissing which is very nice and then if \nwe scroll down we have George and \nVictoria who are the ones who we need to \npay uh give extra caution right because \nthey have more than one allergy and we \ncan see this in the console in a few \nminutes of how to take the right length \num and kind of see the people who have \nmore than one hour energy \num \nall right so this is a little bit about \nthe data set and what we're going to be \ngetting into in this demo \num quickly I will go over to the \ndid that \nyou still see my screen okay \nuh we can steal your vs code yes \nlet me just get that okay \nare you Ken see it are you good okay \nsorry about that all right so here we \nhave our scheme on everything is \nstandard \num except with uh V16 if you want to \nindex by the no state or also by the \nproperty length you have to go into the \ninverted index uh config and set these \ntwo \num parameters to true the default is \nfalse um but maybe if you anticipate \nyour data set having no values or that \nyou want to filter by the property \nlength then just set it to true it \ndoesn't hurt you right \num so that's a little bit of the schema \nand how you have to configure that next \nI will go over to the \num \njust click on it um uploading the data \nset \num or uploading the data to eviate this \nis also standard but I will just scroll \ndown and highlight the key difference \nthat you'll need in order to perform \nthese filters um so you have to tell \nviviate that if there are no properties \nthat is okay not to break don't \nregurgitate like an error message \num so yeah just having the lg.get you're \ngoing to grab the allergy but if there's \nnone that is completely fine and then \nalso here in the properties where we've \ndefined it in our schema in the last \nfile \nhey Erica I uh I have a question \num because early on when you were \nshowing the data \num that we had like two different kind \nof examples I think where yeah Noah like \nNoah doesn't have allergy but Emma does \nbut it's set to know uh will how how how \nhow will we we respond to that what \nwhat's going to happen to that when he \nImports it into a database well good \nquestion the short answer is that it \nwill import the same but in a little \nmore detail on movie Imports the objects \nand it skips the note values \num but then for the index it will set \nthe missing slational properties to null \nit's kind of like back and forth um so \nkind of does it the same but do you \nwanna \nbasically doesn't matter whether we just \nskip the property or set it to null \nright exactly which is nice you know \nyeah \nit's a good feature to happen because I \ndon't know if you have a large data set \nand you can't really go through it all \nit's convenient \nnice nice okay \nso let's jump into the console \ndoes that sound good \nyeah let's do it serious to see what \nkind of thing \nyeah all right so since I started off \nwith the Israel property let me start \noff with that \num so here we're gonna get the food \nallergies which is our class um and here \nI describe the name \num just so we can see that our data has \nbeen properly uploaded \num let's do the fun part of grabbing the \nwear filter of the isnal \nperfect where \nso \nand this is not \na bit like this \nall right and now we're going to take \nthe path \nof allergy right because that's just \nwhere \nI have me missing properties \num and then we have the Valley Brewing \num so this you're going to set it to \ntrue and then we can also see that if \nyou want to set it to \nand then we obviously have our new \noperator of the isnal \nand they shouldn't worry \nall right it's a Moment of Truth \neveryone hold your breath \num so here we have we're taking the \nallergy \num property and setting it to if the \nproperty is missing \num yeah it's just going to return the \nnames where it is missing and then the \nalternative is to set it to false to \nfind the people who do have the allergy \nlocated \nokay cool that's uh by the way I'm \nimpressed how you can write your graphql \nunder pressure or live and everything so \nuh that's that's pretty impressive but \nthat's really cool \num so I guess \num at least my take away from it is that \nlike we could use it to like maybe find \npeople that do or don't have allergies \nbut maybe we could also use it to like \nclean up our data right like say if \nwe're missing like email fields and then \nyou could kind of go like hey let's uh \nlet's make sure everybody in my in our \ndatabase has emails so we could like \nvery quickly just find like hey \num I said null is fine to the database \nbut maybe not for the cleanliness of my \ndatabase right course and in Jesse's \ncase this would be useful just to \nconfirm that everyone won't have a food \nallergy or need an EpiPen in Italy right \nso \ndifferently \nwell usually if you do have an allergy \nlike you would be cautious and be \nprepared for the all possible cases \nright of course \nand then \num \nfor the people that might have a little \nbit of \na bit of um and we need to find \num yeah just people who have more than \none allergy it's a little more severe \num we're going to take \nyou can measure these lengths \nhey uh could we also show the actual \nallergy property because I think you \njust showing name for now oh yeah of \ncourse let me go back \nit's included down here right because if \nthe valuable line is set to false then \nyou'll be able to see \num if it has the peanut allergy along \nwith Samantha and then um for people \nthat have more than one it is also \nlisted and then yeah \ngood so let me guess you'll be now \nyou'll be able to look for those that \nhave more than one \nhow did you know \nI don't know \nall right and then I can all right so we \nwant to find people who have um \nmore than one \nit's like the operator could be greater \nthan \nnow we have Victoria and George who need \na little more cautious like a care to \nmake sure that they don't eat these \nspecific things \nbut it's extremely easy and that's the \nwhole point of it right is to \nshow \nI guess yeah that's actually pretty cool \num how quickly we can just find that \nand it's nice um yeah \nthis is super awesome \nI have a question so if we go back to \nthe um to the vs code how do I enable \nthis functionality do I just have to \nwhen I set my architecture I have to let \nit know that I want this enabled of \ncourse yeah um so this the default is to \num for it to be false \num but if you anticipate that there will \nbe no values or you want to index it for \nthe property length you want to set it \nto true you can see you do that in the \nbeginning because if not you'll run into \nerrors okay awesome \nI had another thing I was thinking \nearlier in our meeting we were talking \nabout using K nearest neighbor \nclassification webiate and I was \nthinking watching there is no value \nmaybe we could use the search with the \nunstructured data to fill in the missing \nvalues because I think a lot of times we \nuse like fill in the media and you can \nuse this nearest neighbor thing that's \nfill in the missing values it's really \ncool yeah that's super awesome you can \ndo like 10 years neighbors imputation \nwith this right look for null values and \nthen look for the yeah that's it that's \nactually \nyou'll hear more about that in the in \nthe next movie podcast \nexactly let's do that you already signed \nup for it right yeah \nyour name all over it \nyou know I agree it's good for data \npre-processing if you just want to go \nstraight into using weavate rather than \nusing pandas or python it's nice to have \nthis option \nis there a way we could actually mix \nthose uh queries like uh mixing length \nand is null \nI don't know we could maybe look for \nlike hey show me the results where \nthere are some allergies but there's \nless than something I don't know \nI think we meet way too often because \nyou can read my mind \num so \nthis is for \nfor people that have \nwhat did even work why maybe you're \nmissing a closing bracket again at the \nend \nat least three indentation seems \nthere we go hey thank you \nand now that's how everybody knows that \nthis is a live demo and not a fake \nyeah so just people who have lost into \nallergies and then also their properties \nand such and all um so this there is a \nway to combine to teach operators \nand that is my demo thank you so much \nhey uh and then documentation where in \nthe docs can we find it do you have a \nlink to us for us let me track this over \num so if you go to graphql references \nfilters \num if you scroll up here is \ndocumentation on filtering my property \nlength and then also the it's not filter \nand then um there is a disclaimer that \nyou do need to set your schema to handle \nthis um and this is where you will find \nthat information \nperfect thank you awesome \nexcellent so uh \nuh this was great um so maybe how about \nwe go next with Zen uh because then you \nare covering a couple of features in the \nrelease blog post but uh I'm pretty sure \neveryone will want to hear first about \nthe note status API what's all that \nabout like uh why do we need it \nyeah so this is a really interesting \nfeature \num it's a convenient feature really uh \nis what it is it allows you to once \nyou've got your cluster spun up you want \nto get an idea of how it's going you \nwant to diagnose if there's problems \nthis is a you can submit a get request \nto this uh API endpoint and it tells you \nexactly how your data is stored on your \nclusters and whether there's a problem \nwith your clusters or not and if there \nis a problem it'll tell you \num where the where the problem is \num rather than me talk about it let me \nshow you a demo what I'll do is I'll \nI'll spin up a bunch of uh alleva \ncluster with multiple nodes and then \nwe'll try to see if we can break \nsomething \nall right so let's do \nso there's there's a bunch of terminals \nthat you're seeing here I'll let you \nknow exactly this is the most important \nterminal here on the right I'm going to \ncreate uh nodes in these two terminals \non the left so what I'm going to do is \nI'm going to set up alleviate and I'm \ngoing to start it up in this cluster \nso let me kick that off \nokay so now there is can I allow that \nokay so now in my local host under port \n8080 I've got uh I've got one node for \nvv8 up and running \nand then I'm going to \nkick off another node here from the \nsecond terminal and this is going to \noccupy Port 8081 \nkick that off \nallow that \nand \nokay \nso many notes yeah we're good to go and \nthis is only two nodes so now what I \nwant to do is \nlet me make sure I'm in the right \nrepository I am okay let me clear that \nnow what I want to do is I want to run a \nrun this import file that is going to \nbasically send uh objects to these nodes \nand so I upload data to these and you \ncan see that the nodes are responding \nthey're they're \ngobbling up that data \nokay so we're good to go here now what \nwe can do is \num if we want to know if if these nodes \nare perfectly fine if they're \ncommunicating well together \nyou can go ahead and call this new API \nand this is the main feature that that \nwe're showing off right \nwe can uh we can send a get request to \nour um to our Local Host \nlocalhost here port 8080 that's where \nthe uh the head node is \nV1 and the endpoint is nodes \nI'm going to take that and \nso this is what the response looks like \nit's a bit hard to see so what I'm going \nto do is I'm going to pipe that to my um \nmy Json prettifier \nand so now we can see that \nwell first of all you see that this the \nnodes get the get the request over here \nand you can see exactly the \nconfiguration that your nodes are in \nit tells you how many nodes you have so \nyou have one node and then you have the \nsecond node over here \nyou can also see how the data is stored \nin your nodes \nwhat the object count is for for each \none of the classes that you've got here \nand the classes here are pretty generic \nso it's um I'm not going to go into how \nhow the schema looks or anything like \nthat but the main idea \nthe main idea here is the status of the \nnode right so you can tell that node one \nis healthy \nand node 2 is also healthy right \nso there's three values that this status \nflag can take healthy is what you want \nto see but now I want to show you what \nuh what else will happen right so let's \nsay we simulate a crash in the second \nnode here so I just crash this node \nand for everyone at home don't try to do \nit at home it can be dangerous \nonly let it let it to prose like Zen to \ndo it \nyeah simulating a data loss event over \nhere okay so now we're shutting down \nthis server and you can see that the \nfirst node uh realized that it it failed \nit sent the paint to node two it failed \nit's marking it as failed so node one \nknows that the second node failed but do \nyou know that the second node failed \nright well now the answer is that you \ncan know you can call this API same \nendpoint \nand now you get another response which \nis different from the response that we \njust got and now it tells you that you \nhave node one and you can see here that \nthe status is unhealthy because you no \nlonger have no two and if you look into \nit further you can see that because your \nclasses uh were you had object counts \nthat were being shared and stored on \nnode 2 and node one all of the object \ncounts on node two are no longer there \nand so you've uh pretty much if this if \nthis node loss was permanent You've Lost \nThat data and now you can tell uh \ntell whether the whether your cluster is \nin a healthy or an unhealthy state \nthere is also a intermediate step here \nwhere let's say you call this API in the \nmoment that the second node is going \ndown you'll get you'll get a status \nupdate that says unavailable \nand so that is a transitionary state \nbetween healthy and unhealthy \nbut I like to think of this feature as \nthe as the cluster doctor right you're \nyou're basically taking your stethoscope \nand you're assessing whether or not your \nclusters are in good health \nbut okay but is it like when it goes \ndown completely isn't it unavailable \nactually \nyeah so that's interesting so the \ntechnology that we're using behind this \num once the node is completely down \nuh it doesn't actually send any response \nright so we can't tell what the object \ncount on that node was so here you only \nget node one and the state of node one \nis unhealthy not because Node 1 crashed \nbut because the cluster had Node 1 and \nnode two and now node 2 crashes right so \nthe status here is uh the status of your \noverall cluster \noh right that makes a lot of sense okay \nthat's pretty cool hey what was the the \ncommand and I'm gonna change the subject \nslightly but what was the command that \nyou use for predefying your Json oh this \nis just a JQ so this is the um so I'm \npiping the output into uh into this uh \nJson for the fire because I always use \nJson PP so that's kind of interesting \nokay and to see \nnice that that's pretty cool I wonder \nlike we'll be probably cool to see next \nas well is like being able to subscribe \nto any of those events uh I'm pretty \nsure Etienne has some ideas around it or \nsomeone \nyeah I think it's pretty interesting \nthere's so right now this is just a more \nof a passive monitoring \num so the doctor can see what's going on \nthey can't do anything about it or they \ncan't fix it at this point \num \nthe engineering team has some pretty \ninteresting ideas on on next steps for \nthis to make this an active API where \nyou can actually modify the state of \nyour cluster through uh through a \nsimilar API so \nsoon soon about that in an episode of uh \nWe've eaten here that's pretty cool and \nand also I guess that'll be cool if \nthere was a way to I don't know back up \ndata from multiple nodes let's say I \ndon't know oh \nstay tuned yeah we're getting to that \nyeah stay tuned for another 15 minutes \nand what happens if you want to rerun \nthis simple you're being error \nuh no so you can run this API as many \ntimes as you want right how how about if \nyou um fix node two \num so that node one would be healthy \nyeah yeah so if we fix that node two \nhere so if I rerun it \nsee \noh it doesn't run it's telling me that \nthe the port is not available \nit should be available \nor it's permanently lost we can't run it \nagainst \nit and kids this is why you shouldn't be \ntrying that at home you shouldn't be \ncrashing your notes \nvoluntarily it's for science guys it's \nfor science \nawesome \nlove it love it all right thanks uh \nthanks and this was a really cool \noverview so for anyone that's using \nclustered uh distribution for weviate uh \ndefinitely you should know about uh this \nnew endpoint the V1 notes \num all right then next person that we \nhave is Conor so Connor you've been \nworking on this this is actually pretty \nuh personal release because not only you \nwere covering it in the blog post but \nyou you were working on the centroid uh \nmodule yourself right for quite a few \nmonths and we spent some time working on \na demo and everything \num tell us what's all what's this all \nabout \nyeah and thanks to everyone who's been \nhelping me you know in the creation of \nthis learn how new features are \ndeveloped in weba and the research of \nproduct flow has been so interesting um \nso ref to VEC it's named as such because \nit's reference to Vector we have cross \nreferences between classes and I think \nthis is a this relational structure that \nwe V8 adds in addition to Vector search \nas you vectorize unstructured data you \nhave a structured symbolic properties \nthat you can use to filter the hnsw \nsearch and you know we have our inverted \nindexes of the categories there's all \nsorts of things we can do with the \nproperties and I think expanding into \nwhat we can do with the relations is an \nincredibly interesting direction for \nwev8 so I'm going to start off by \nshowing this example of ref divex \napplication and recommendation and then \nfrom there kind of expand on the future \nof how we can do this and then I think \nthat also transitions well into the \ntopic of using ref to VEC to represent \nlong documents that are longer than the \nsay 512 token input length to sentence \nTransformers or uh and or complex \nobjects that say it's a you know a real \nestate listing it's got images of the \nhouses it's got graph structure data \nabout the neighborhood it's got the \nsymbolic metadata it's got text \ndescriptions so how can we have \nreferences in our data and then combine \nthese vectors to represent massive \nthings so let's start with \nrecommendation so what we're seeing now \nwe're probably all used to using weba to \nyou know search through our catalog we \nsay you know search green shorts and \nthen bang There are the green shorts \nand we're used to doing this kind of \nthing so we usually would have it as a \nproducts is our classes product and then \nit's a have text description and so all \nthe text descriptions of these items are \nvectorized the queries vectorize and \nthen boom approximate nearest neighbor \nhere's your product that matches your \nquery so now what we're doing is we're \nintroducing a user class so user class \nliked item item so what we're seeing \nwith this image grid is an example of \nhaving say a home fee or if you want to \nhave yeah like a home feed kind of \nfeature into your apps that you can \nbuild with weviate now so if you have a \nBlog you could personalize some kind of \nrecommended articles with this kind of \ninterface by using the centroid from the \nuser so now let's start using it so I'm \nthe user I you know I'm here I'm looking \nfor a backpack I'm not looking for any \nof these clothing so so as you have the \nfirst backpack you see how you're now \ndoing a nearest image search where this \nbackpack is the query \nand say you're particularly looking for \nthe strapless the strap backpack \ncompared to like this duffel backpack so \nyou click another strap and then it \nstarts to you know it will average these \ntwo vectors to be the vector that you're \nsearching through these with and so that \nrepresents the user preference of \nbackpack so we could you know have our \nhome feed is loaded by showing backpacks \nbecause that's the only item that our \nuser is interested in on our uh say \ne-commerce website it's another fun \nexample of this I think is looking \nthrough the watches is just an example \nof something that's has like a \nparticular difference so you see with \nthe watches how you you could have like \na digital LED screen or you could have \nthe you know the classic kind of clock \nstyle so as we you know as we do this we \nsee we have the digital screen if we \nclick two of them it prior it can \nvisually tell to prioritize see how \nthese are ranked ahead of these ones \nsimilarly if we you know click this \nstyle unclick that style and you know \nadd that one then it shows us this one \nalso with the same style so it's showing \nthat semantic visual features at the \npre-trained resnet and the alleviate \nimage to VEC module can capture I think \nis a really fun example so it's kind of \ntransitioning a bit so right now it's \ncalled ref to Vex centroid we're \naveraging out these two vectors to form \nthe vector to represent the user another \ninteresting idea that we're exploring is \nrough Divac centroids where we say have \nwatches backpacks and we have these two \nclusters in our Vector space so we would \nhave a centroid for each of the Clusters \nand so looking into whether we want to \nsay use k-means or hdb scan clustering \nfor this kind of thing and a new Eva \npodcast is coming out is with Martin \ngrudendorst who developed Bert topic and \nhe explained so many interesting \ninsights about the difference between \nk-means and hdb scan clustering \nand how they preserve the semantics in \nthe centroid so we're looking into that \nkind of hdb scan implementation and \ngolang and delivering multiple centroids \nso you could have a blend between \nwatches and then a blend between \nbackpacks or whatever it is that you're \nrecommending for the user so then let's \ntalk about this idea of how we're \naggregating vectors across the edges and \nthis transitions into just one of the \nmost interesting topics in deep learning \nwhich is graph neural networks so graph \nneural networks message passing networks \nyou you only send messages in each layer \nof the deep neural network to the \nneighbors so you collect the neighbors \nthen you have several layers of doing \nthis with non-linear activation \ndifferentiable weight Matrix until you \ndo something like predict clicks at the \nend so to contrast it with the graph \nneural networks one thing we could do is \nhave like an XG boost machine learning \nalgorithm where you would search for \nthese watches and then you would have a \nclassifier that's trained on clicks to \nre-rank it based on the xgboost \nclassifier of whether you click this but \nanother thing we could do is propagate \nthese embeddings out with graph neural \nnetworks that do that node \nclassification task and I think that's \nreally interesting \nso then concluding you know again we \nhave this idea of if you'll look at the \nwevia Wikipedia demo we have a breakdown \nof Wikipedia articles are too long to \nput into Burr it's longer than 512 \ntokens you can't just have a in for \ninspector for the entire Wikipedia \narticle it was broken down into passage \nin article article and that's a you know \nthat's a graph relation with the \npassages so the question is how do we \naggregate these vectors into single \nsearchable vectors or say we have the \ncentroid idea so the central idea would \ngive us multiple vectors for the article \nto search through so if we have the \nLeBron James Wikipedia article \nwe'd have centroid to say describe his \ncareer with the Lakers Cavaliers the you \nknow Akron Ohio these would be different \ncentroid clusters but maybe with the \ngraph neural networks we could compress \nthat into a single Vector so I think \nthere are just so many interesting ideas \nwe can do adding this relational \nstructure into our Vector search and \nthese kind of cool ideas I think \nstarting out with the recommendation \ndeveloping home feeds with we V8 is I \nthink one of the most interesting ways \nto get started using ref to VEC \nthis is this is cool because I was \nimmediately thinking like uh this this \ncould be like a really interesting way \nto like provide recommendation if \nsomeone let's say you're doing research \non a topic and then you're scouring like \na huge database of papers and then if \nyou saw like one paper on that on one \ntopic and then something else and then \nimmediately could go like oh you look at \nto this uh two of those papers let's say \nuh I don't know graph connections Etc \nyou're like hey here's another few and \nthen based on what you selected like \ncontinuously could provide you like more \nand more refined recommendations so that \nyou can kind of keep going and keep \nlooking for \nuh different articles and if at one \npoint you pivot into certain area like \nthe centroid the average can keep moving \nright \nyeah I love that you said that when we \nfirst wanted to explore this I was using \nthere's this Twitter account called AK \nuh it would be like 4201 and he tweets \nnew archive papers every night like six \nevery night it's crazy and so you know I \nI interacted this a lot and so we \nextracted all the people who like tweets \nfrom AK and then we put all the AK and \nthen we rank them based on doing this \nrestavec and I was able to see the \ndifference and say my recommendations \ncompared to I did the user dissimilarity \nbecause I can use myself as a query I \ncan also find my most least similar \nneighbors \nand so you know it was someone who likes \nthese audio papers like it's not that I \nhave anything against audios just that \nI've never looked into it and I just \nthought it was so cool to see it capture \nthat in kind of a real world example \nlike exactly if you described \nnice nice yeah because like you mean \nlike also like one of the things that I \nwas thinking about is just like uh when \nI watch uh stuff on like Netflix or HBO \nEtc right like they always give you like \nthose recommendations based on like what \nyou've been watching uh recently so that \nthat sounds like something also that \ncould work \num but like how far can we go back in in \nwith with those uh searches like is \nthere like a recommendation like go for \nup to five or can we go with a hundred \nwhat what's the story around that I'm \nkind of curious yeah that's another \nreally interesting idea we're looking \ninto is in the uh in the module \nconfiguration having an interaction \nwindow so say it only uses the last \nthree interactions in the website to \nform the center as right now it's the \naveraging in a single centroid so yeah \nwe could have that interaction window \nand I think maybe another phrase I left \nout is just session based recommendation \nonline recommendation how we how you \ncould you know open up say tick tock and \nyou don't have an account and you just \nstart interacting and boom already \nyou're getting recommendations you don't \nneed to have this train this machine \nlearning model on click prediction you \ncan just boom start running with \nrecommendations \nnice nice another I think this is \npretty interesting that this seems like \na game changer for both content-based \nand collaborative based recommender \nsystems right \num is is this more efficient than what \nwhat is currently used in those fields \nor \nbecause if \num from what I know of the field right \nnow they're they're essentially trying \nto capture the meaning behind the \ncontent that's consumed right if I buy \none type of watch then they'll recommend \nsimilar types of watches maybe they'll \nrecommend the same company's watches but \nwhat you're doing here is you're you're \nlearning that you're learning what's \nsimilar about those watches and then \nrecommending it okay so it's it \ngoes one level deeper right \noh yeah that's that's a good point \nbecause I always hate when like I search \nfor something like oh yeah I don't know \na new tripod for my camera and then like \nevery art everywhere else it kind of \ngoes like you've been looking for this I \nwas like yeah I know there's no not much \nhelp but if you gave me a \nrecommendations like oh that's a cool \ntripod I didn't know what existed but \nyes I am looking for a cool driver \nhuh it really solves the cold start \nproblem like along with new users if \nthey're most similar to some users \npatterns before and even for this \nexample when you clicked on the silver \nwatch that's a little more fancy the \nbackpack with the straps changed to this \nnice duffel bag right so you can kind of \nlike put a whole outfit together with \njust like kind of searching around for \nwhat you want so it's kind of cool \nyeah yeah that's kind of cool that the \nduffel bag goes well with the silver \nwatch it matches \nyeah that's super interesting because \nnow that you can break down a product \ninto its individual components on a \nvector there's nothing that's stopping \nyou from comparing a fancy watch to a \nfancy backpack whereas before you were \njust like maybe you're comparing like \nthe relative price of that watch versus \nthe relative price of the backpack \num \nand I never thought about it that way \nthat's super interesting actually \nyeah \nI guess the cool thing is that it's like \nthere's so many ideas that even we \ndidn't think about and so I'm really \ncurious how everyone else starts using \nit and like what kind of use cases we're \ngoing to learn about \nas a call to action everyone if you're \nwatching it you should definitely try \nCentro it like you know uh try to come \nby use case that we didn't think about \nand then surprise us and surprise Conor \nmost of all he's so proud of his baby \ncool \nnice nice \num is that all Connor that covers the \ncentroids \noh yeah I'd say uh we're also gonna have \na blog post published soon and uh yeah \nwe're you know work at interaction \nwindow the ux for the collaborative \nfiltering as Zayn mentioned quickly \nwhere you add the rating thing and and \nyeah just rolling along with this I \nthink recommendation is gonna be such a \ncool use case for weviate as well as \nbecause it is kind of certain personal \nsearch yeah \nperfect perfect thanks a lot for uh this \ndemo \num all right so I guess we have a couple \nof other session uh features that we've \nadded to deviate and on my agenda I have \nJP to go next \nuh so JP what are you going to tell us \nabout sounds good sounds good thanks \nSebastian um could you put my slides up \nif you don't mind \nI don't mind at all where are you here \nso yeah I'll be talking about it's going \nto be a little bit of a change of pace \nso with 116 and we've added Azure \nsupport to the way we do authentication \nwith oidc \num let's talk a little bit about RDC \nthough because like I was writing the \nblog about it and I was like reading and \nI was like oh this is really cool and I \nwas thinking about what kind of like is \nthe catchphrase or like the you know \nfine line I want to go with and I was \nlike well let's talk about how much we \nall hate passwords because I don't know \nabout you guys but I use a password \nmanager I'm trying to you know maintain \nsecurity practices and whatnot but it is \npretty unwieldy \nand more and more AGP sorry to interrupt \nas like how is that even a question like \nif you're not doing that if you're not \nusing a password manager what's wrong \nwith you some people don't you'd be \nsurprised you know working in it or in \nyou know Tech it's it's a bit different \nbut yeah I promise I'm a nice person \nuh but yeah like if you don't like I \nthink it's a good idea to use one \num but yeah like it is a problem until \nwe have password managers that was such \na huge headache \npeople are like oh I've got a system \nwhat is it it's my dog's name plus like \nfour different numbers and it's like no \nthat's not a big box \nchange my passwords now \nso it wasn't meant to be a sub tweet \nkind of but um you know \num so we'll talk a little bit about oidc \nso it's really cool so more and more \nwe're seeing like these uh single signos \nright whether it's with through Google \nthrough Microsoft or whatever and it \nreally tackles this one problem of like \nhow do we secure our resources and \nmaintain usability \nand I was really you know excited to see \nthat with um at alleviate or at semif \nincluded IDC features so it can do \nauthentication \num easily whilst maintaining security \nright so that's kind of what my next \nslide is it's really a combination of \nthe two things that give you those \nfeatures it's authentication that tells \nthe end client or the app who you are \nand you can trust who people say who it \nis and based on that you can do your \nauthorization you know whichever way you \nwant to so some people obviously do both \nin the same uh you know using the same \ntools I suppose so authentication with \noatc and maybe your authorization would \ngo off \num but with weaviate we use oidc for \nauthentication so we can trust that \npeople are who they say they are not \njust you know a text box typed into a \nfield so they can I can pretend to be I \ndon't know Elon Musk or whoever \num and based on that we can use we can \nuse that identity to enable \ndifferentiated authorization \nand for people who's not really familiar \nwith how IDC works this is kind of the \nworkflow I've skipped a couple of steps \nbut basically the point is that you know \nin the same way that a lot of people \nwould have seen you go to log in \nsomewhere whether it's uh again \nMicrosoft or whatever and then you sign \non and you get a token back and of \ncourse through the magic of public uh \nprivate care security you'll know that \nyour token is secure and we passed that \ntoken to eviate and weavate it's like oh \nyeah you are you know this person Connor \nat semi dot whatever \num or you know or you're not right \nbecause your token is uh doesn't have \nthe right signature on it and you can \nsend them the right response \nso the change with 116 is that we've \nadded Azure support so even though oidc \nis an open protocol people do implement \nit slightly differently so that means \nit's not like a one-size-fits-all \nsolution \num likely we're using the module system \nwhich means that we can keep on adding \nthese functionalities as we go and one \nof the benefits of course with Azure is \nthat a lot of people would already have \nsome sort of a you know employee \ndirectory or some sort of directory of \nusers in Microsoft \num Azure active directory so we can \nleverage that or they can leverage that \nwith webiate so if you already have a \ndatabase of users you can use that and \nget people to sign on through there get \ntheir identity tokens and go and do your \ndo your thing in weba \num so as an example of what that allows \nyou to do is to have a one database we \ncan give tiered access to different \npeople right so instead of having like \noh here's like one instance of we V8 \nwhich is for like Public Access you know \nhere's like one instance of Eva for like \nactually private use whatever what we \ncan do is to control who gets access to \nwhy so you might say well actually \neverybody regardless of who you are \nwhether you're authenticated even if \nyou're an economist Anonymous user you \ncan read some part of your database \nright so maybe your demo data as a lot \nof data providers you know tend to do \nfor marketing reasons or just you know \nuh just getting your getting your name \nout there but then with these tokens you \ncan give one group of users read access \nto the whole database as long as they're \nauthenticated \nand you can have another list and this \nis where the authorization based on your \nauthentication comes in so you can say \nwell actually these guys are in the \nadmin list so they can actually read and \nwrite whether it's you know deleting um \ncertain certain entities or entries and \nadding new objects right so you can do \nall of that and really um having these \nIDC tokens means we can decouple the \nsecurity requirements because you know \nthat's kind of not what we do right and \npeople can trust that these things are \nhappening securely you don't have to \nremember yet another bloody password \num and it's all kind of done securely \nand safely while kind of not \ncompromising on the accessibility side \nof things so yeah I kind of learned a \nlot reading about it uh writing about it \nwas really cool and yeah it's it's good \nthat I think you know all these um of \nthis authentication and authorization \nneeds are moving to these kind of open \nuh transparent and secure standards that \nare evolving as well as you know easy to \nuse so yeah that's really cool \nHey so uh because you you talked about \noidc but like I also know about all like \nwhat's what's the difference like what's \nHow do they \nyeah that's a good question so they're \nboth by the same um standard open ID \nstandard oidc is built on auth on top of \nthat so the main difference is that \nthere are two different types of tokens \nright so you can get the uh what's \ncalled an authorization token I'm gonna \nhave to make sure I don't mess this up \noh that's action token which is \ntypically used for providing access to \ncertain assets right based on things \num but IDC is built on top of that so \nthey provide but it all uh \nauthentication sorry authorization \ntokens doesn't tell the um doesn't tell \nyou anything about who it is it just \nsays Whoever has this token can use \nthese resources whereas open oidc \num ads on top of that and adds what's \ncalled ID tokens right and the ID token \nwill basically have secure encrypted \ninformation about assigned as you say \ninformation about who you are right so \nit'll say this person whoever is using \nthis token is this person \nand we can kind of using uh we use \nencryption to prove that that is true \nright so that's that's the difference \nI see and how are the tokens validated \nyeah um so it's like the um asymmetrical \nbut basically like it's all the magic of \na spectacle encryption right so there's \nit's a public um private key encryption \nthe same way that if you log on to \nGitHub using your keys you have your \nprivate keys and GitHub has your public \nkey so they can see that your \ninformation is encrypted and they can \ndecrypt even though they can't encrypt \nit themselves right \num because they can tell that it has \nbeen encrypted by you and this is the \nsignature kind of works the other way \nwhere it the signature is signed by uh \nthe let's say Microsoft in this case by \nAzure because they've got their private \ncase and if you have their public key \nyou can verify that it has been \nencrypted by them and has not been \ntampered with so \num yeah I don't want to pretend to go \ntoo much into the maps but it's it's all \none-way functions with very large prime \nnumbers \num and all that so I did take one course \nin cyber security so it sounds familiar \nthank you \nbut yeah just as a huge nerd I remember \nreading this book called crypto back in \nthe day it's like way off topic but um \nit's all about like the development of \nRSA \num uh standards and like who did it and \nall these like interesting stuff but \nlike export restrictions and they ended \nup like exporting all this stuff by \nprinting out new books because that was \nlike one way to get them get around the \nexport restrictions at the time it's \nlike really interesting stuff so if \nyou're interested in that check it out \nI think this tiered access thing is \nsuper cool so I've worked in uh in the \ndata related healthcare industry in the \npast and any regulated industry \num for example in in healthcare you have \nHIPAA compliance only certain Healthcare \nprofessionals are allowed to see \nspecific patient data \num not only do they not they're not \nsupposed to have access to it but this \ncomponent of oidc that you mentioned you \nneed to know who accesses something \nbecause if if somebody \num inadvertently or incorrectly access \nthe wrong information all of that needs \nto leave a paper trail right so \num but the question is the question I \nhave is what happens if the uh the \nprovider servers go down in that case \nlet's say the service won't happen yeah \nthat's a good question obviously if the \nwavier loads are down you can't access \ndata but one of the cool things about \ntoken based systems is that once you \nhave that token \num you don't really really you don't \nreally need to access the token issue or \nservers all that often right so you need \nto issue it every so and when you want \nto first get the token or when you need \nto reissue the token because it is time \nlimited along the time right for \nsecurity but other than that and also a \ntime when you want to pick up the public \nkey for verifying the signatures \num so other than those small Windows of \ntime you're kind of Fairly robust to \nthat which is which is really cool \nthat's cool \nnice nice \nI was kind of thinking it's like because \ncan you invalidate that token like say \nlike hey I gave this token away before \nbut now I don't want to accept it \nanymore yeah so um with auth I think \nthere's a few different ways of doing \nthat so a common situation is like you \nmight issue a token you know an \nauthorization oauth token especially to \nan employee and then what happens if you \nyou know terminate employment or you \nknow if they leave whatever right so you \ncan either um \nyeah there's ways of doing it so a \ncommon ways like you get a token that \nexpires fairly quickly like in an hour \nor you know whatever number of hours and \nthen but you get a renewal key or a \nrenewal um key so you can use that to \nkeep getting your token and the new \nrenewal key so again turn off the tab at \nthe server end to say that this renewal \nkey will no longer work because they no \nlonger work for us so that's one way to \ndo it \num but again it also means you know you \nonly need to access that server like \nonce every you know frequency of every \ntime it expires so again okay if you can \nachieve both things yeah \ncool cool \nnice so I I guess yeah again I think \nthis is a pretty use uh useful feature I \nthink one one example where we \ninternally at semi are using it \num like the tiered access uh to \num uh to to deviate it's actually how we \nbuild some of our public facing demos uh \nso for example like everybody probably \nknow about this Wikipedia demo uh so if \nyou try to access that uh AP uh that \ndate that instance a vb8 without \nauthentication you can actually run \nqueries but but you can't make any read \nor write \nyou know commands which is really cool \nbecause on one side we we have the \ncontrol of what data goes there you know \nlike some some people put like uh maybe \nthey'll put some bad objects or \nsomething and we can avoid that we can \nmake sure that the demo always is in a \ngood shape but then at the same time \nanyone that wants to test it out and and \nsee like what sort of queries you can \nrun on Wikipedia \num uh it they can access it so I think \nthat's also like one of the good \napproaches to do that \nyeah so yeah \nnice all right so uh conscious of time \nuh next uh we have uh well leaving the \nbest for last uh so we have Zen uh Zen \nyou like in the in the last one I \nreleased blog post you were also \ncovering an update to the backup \nfunctionality uh in in viviate so uh \nwhat's different what's new uh because \nyeah this is this is one of the main \nFlagship updates um it was uh super \nawesome to learn about this and talk to \nall the engineers and the whole process \nof how the the inner guts were revamped \nto provide this new functionality \nquickly stated basically what it allows \nyou to do is \num before you could back up your data as \nlong as it was stored on one node right \nif all of your objects are stored on one \nnode that could be backed up okay \num even if you had your objects or your \nclasses multi-sharded and what that \nmeans is instead of storing one table \nyou take call your rows of your table \nand now you create let's say you have a \na table of four rows \nyou can create two shards of it where \nnow that data exists that's two tables \nbut now both of two rows so you can \nmulti-sharg your data and as long as you \nare doing that physically on one \ncomputer you could still back it up \nright that was 1.15 the new added \nfunctionality is that you can take these \nmulti-shards that you can distribute \nthem across hundreds of different \ncomputers and you can still back it up \nas if it all existed in one computer and \nthat's a super cool feature because \nthere's we can get into the many \nadvantages of sharding if we want but \none of the things that I want to show \nyou if you could share my screen here \nkind of just hidden into the first demo \nwas this idea of multi-shorting what I \ndid in that first demo was I spun up uh \ntwo nodes and then I pushed data to \nthose nodes right and here I didn't \nspecify how the data was supposed to be \nstored whether one class was supposed to \nbe stored only on exclusively node one \nand then another class was exclusively \nstored on the second node so this is a \nbit more \num of the functionality of the node API \nfeature but the data that you get back \nfrom that feature you can actually tell \nthat the data is multi-sharded so if you \nlook at your category class you can see \nthat nine of the objects that I pushed \nare stored on node one and the other 10 \nuh for the yeah so if you look at the \ncategory class here or the other 10 are \nstored on node two so this is what it \nmeans to have multiple shards for the \nsame class right same column category \ncolumn but you have 10 rows that are \nstored in node two and nine rows that \nare stored in uh in node one and this is \nwhat a multi-shard multi-node uh cluster \nlooks like \nwith 1.16 you can now back this system \nup entirely you could just call the \nbackup functionality on this uh on this \ncluster and it would be able to preserve \nall of your data so in in the event loss \nthat we had where node two went down you \ncould back it up and retrieve all the \ndata immediately \nthe additional the one other one last \nthing that I'll add is that on the user \ninterface side nothing has changed right \nso you could still call the exact same \nuh apis to back up the data it's just \nthat now you have the ability to backup \nmulti-node multi-charted data \nnice so can I then if I have a backup \ncreated with version 115 can I restore \nit into 116 instance as well exactly \nexactly it's it's perfectly backwards \ncompatible \nso that could be a cool way to migrate \nto a newer version of V8 \nyeah for sure \ndidn't think about it before that's \nactually a fresh one \nis it correctly understanding that like \nyou know as we have like billion scale \ntests that you could have this \nmulti-node backup and then you could \njust restore it to instantly have like a \nbillion scale Vector data set just like \njust restore it and then you're running \nwith it yeah exactly if you have well if \nyou have the compute and the hardware to \nbe able to support it then you could \ndefinitely back it up right and that's \nthe whole the scalability uh component \nof this thing you could have hundreds of \ncomputers where your data data is \ndistributed across those hundreds of \ncomputers and if let's say 20 of them go \ndown you have a backup for the entire \nthing and you could restore those right \nas long as you restore the physical \nHardware then you're good to go \nthat was going to be a good question \nlike what happens if a few of the \ncomputers go down um like what happens \nwith the notes that were on there yeah \nso the the nodes that are present will \nstill be able to you'll still be able to \nback those up but until those uh so \nyou'll have a previous backup uh that \nyou had when the nodes were up okay so \nif the hardware if you restore the \nhardware you can you can recreate those \n20 nodes but you could also actually \ncreate a backup of the 80 computers that \nare that are still remaining \nreally cool \nI think it's just amazing like the you \nknow like how long it would take you to \nsay vectorize like a billion passages \nyou've scraped from the internet now you \nno longer would have to wait for the \nimport times you could just restart it \nand then you're running with it nice \nyeah \nI'm I'm connected yeah because like \nsince you explained like my mind is \ngoing like all possible scenarios \nbecause Connor you mentioned the billion \ndata scale and everything but like what \nif you had a setup where let's say you \nwere perfectly fine like you got 200 \nmillion objects your environment was set \nup just right but then you realize that \nlike your data is growing really fast \nand then suddenly like maybe you need \nmore notes or maybe you need different \nservers so I guess this could be pretty \ncool because we could create a backup \nspin up more instances or more powerful \ninstances and then kind of restore and \nthen now you could grow from let's say \n200 million to like the next level that \nyou anticipate for right yeah exactly \nthe the great thing about distributed um \nDistributing your data across multiple \ncomputers is that it's super scalable \nright not only are the query scalable \nbecause you now per computer you have \nless data you're not storing all of your \ndata on one computer your Aquarius don't \nneed to filter through \num as many data points to before I can \ncome up with an answer but um if \ntomorrow you get much more data you can \nalways expand go from 100 computers to \n200 computers and you have well \nliterally infinite scalability right \nnice that's cool \nall right um so you showed us the demo \nbefore with like two notes uh I'm gonna \nbe trying like 20 now let's see what \nhappens \nbut I promise I won't kill any of them I \nwon't harm them on purpose yeah that's \nmy job yeah that's your job yeah I'll \ncall you over for that \nall right uh thanks and for uh for this \nupdate this is actually super exciting \nisn't it cool that like you talk about \nbackups and many people would find it \nlike uh not so exciting and boring and \nthen Zen comes in and there's like this \nwhole conversation coming up it's like \nyou know then you have a special talent \nyou make even backups sound exciting so \nthat's pretty cool \num all right uh so this is basically \nthis concludes the part of \num the waviate features and updates uh \nso uh like like I mentioned at the \nbeginning of the stream uh we are \nalready on \nvivid116.1 so I definitely recommend you \nall to upgrade to it like especially if \nyou want to take advantage of all the \ncool features uh that the team here just \nuh described uh it's definitely worth it \nwe are super excited really proud about \nit uh but if you have other ideas other \nsuggestions on what should go into evade \nor if you have any feedback or if you \njust want to share some love you know in \nterms of because there's been a lot of \nwork that's uh that went into it uh \nwe're more than happy uh you know join \nus on slack or drop us a message event \nhere uh we monitor the the messages on \nYouTube and we can see them as they come \nin so that's great and I want to uh \nbasically finish with a corner segment \nwhere he will cover like what's new in \nin AI in October and and I know like \nConor you read like uh so many papers \nevery month in research for cool things \nthat could go into alleviate uh so uh \nwhat do you have for us \nyeah cool well let me tell you about \nsome of the things that I thought were \ncalled uh this month and um so First the \nfull screen is good let's sharing it yes \nwe can see we'll be there to Connor sure \nso uh so with the ref the back thing I \nmight have been a little hand wavy with \nthe graph neural network thing so in \nthis slide I promise you we'll \nunderstand what a graph and all that \nwork is uh and starting with this new \npaper from Amazon science recommending \nrelated products using graph neural \nnetworks and directed graphs the core \nthing with the directed graphs is that \nthere's an asymmetry and recommendation \nyou buy an iPhone you need airpods you \nneed a phone case but usually when you \nbuy a phone case you don't also need \nairpods so they have two separate kinds \nof relations in the graph so in wva say \nwe have a phone case uh phone is one \nkind of cloth or it's all product we \nstill have different named relations \nwithin the class so you could have you \nknow co-purchase relationship co-viewed \nwith cross reference relationship and we \nV8 and so they have this graph where you \nhave co-viewed which are these \nbi-directional lines and you have \nco-purchase which are directional lines \nso the way so and really what I want to \ndo with this is explain to the graph and \nall that work is so the core idea of the \ngraph neural network is it has a message \npassage a message passing uh prior so uh \nso when you have and the core idea with \nthis new idea from Amazon science is \nthat you have two embeddings for each \nnode so a has a source embedding and a \nTarget embedding and you know sources \nlike from Network science or you know it \nflows from the source a to c and 2B but \na doesn't flow 2D it's a Target to D so \nthe idea is you have two separate \nembeddings for each of these things so \nlet's get the math and I promise you \nunderstand what a graph enrollment work \nis after this so graph neural networks \nsimilar to deep neural networks it has \nyou know L layers so let's just 8 12 \nwhatever model layers \nso you initialize it with some features \nfor each node so usually say you have a \ntext description of the product bang \nvectorize it with mini LM now you have a \n384 dimensional Vector at layer 0 of the \nnetwork that represents say this iPhone \ncase so now what we're doing is we have \ntwo Edge graphs this subscript CP and \nsubscript CV so what we do is we're \ngoing to do the message passing by \naveraging out the vectors that this \nSource node is connected to so again \nwith this example of a is connected its \nsource it goes to C and B so at each \nlayer of the graph neural network we \naverage the vector of C with the vector \nof B and then we multiply it by that \nlayer's weight Matrix so you know say \nit's 384 the average will be 1 by 384 \ntimes 384 by whatever hidden Dimension \nwe want to do with that layer so let's \nsay it's 512 and then you end up with a \n512 dimensional Vector you can like blow \nup and shrink the uh the kind of latent \nbottleneck that way however you want to \ndo it so in the end you end up with you \nknow any this these weight this is all \ndifferentiable with the weight Matrix so \nyou learn this weight Matrix and in the \nend what you're doing is you're \nproducing embeddings for for the notes \nand the embeddings for the nodes are how \nyou then do recommendations so you want \nto recommend a target from The Source \nyou query with the source node and you \nlearn that node embedding through the \nseveral layers of these graph neural \nnetworks and you do that with this loss \nfunction where you know the co-purchase \nthings you try to make these similar to \nyou know the iPhone Source going to the \niPhone case the Target and make that \ndissimilar from from a randomly sampled \none so let's say there is also like a a \nset of dumbbells also as a sample Target \nthat was also on this like Amazon \nproduct graph so then you also have you \nknow making Source representations \nsimilar to each other in the co-view \nrelations if you know the subscript and \nso that's how it works so uh quickly \nbefore moving on because I think this is \nthe most important like technical \nconcept does everyone feel good about \nwhat a graph neural network is \nare you stacking the um so you mentioned \nthat the uh you have multiple nodes and \nthen you're you're learning the weight \nare they stacked on top of each other is \nthat how the layers work \nexactly so layer zero you have the \ninitial sentence Transformer Vector for \nc and b and then so a will be the \naverage of those two boom then you \nmultiply by the way Matrix and you did \nthat also for C with its E and F \nNeighbors from source and then now we're \non layer one and so on so just keep \ndoing that okay I see \ncool so awesome I hope you all thought \nthat was interesting and thanks for \nthanks guys and uh so some other things \nI thought were really cool and related \nto rest event was uh Pinterest posted \nthis blog about how they use that refx \ncentroids kind of idea for their uh home \nfeed and their recommended pins example \nso they start off by you know you say \nyou have uh 80 of the time you're on \nPinterest you're looking at interior \nkitchen designs 15 let's say birthday \ncards and five percent pictures of dogs \npreviously what they had is then when \nthey're doing the home feed they just \nsample 80 15 5 with the recommendations \nso now they've added this uh Bandit \nstyle feedback loop where what you click \non so you know you say you start \nclicking on the dogs it'll it'll \nincrease the sampling rate from that \nrather than just the static sum of \nactions because say you know you used to \nbe on Pinterest and you looked at like \nthe 2000 images of interior kitchens and \nthen now your recommendation is so \nbiased by your past Behavior so this \nfeedback loop would be one way to update \nit in addition to this kind of \ninteraction window idea \nso next I want to talk about re-ranking \nand I thought this paper was a super \ncool idea so to start off re-ranking is \nabout we retrieve some documents and \nvector vector index returns us a ranked \nlist by Vector indexes but then we'll \nhit it by like a pairwise classifier to \nget even better rankings for the results \nand so what the core Insight is the \nperformance of a re-ranking pipeline is \nlimited by the recall of the candidate \npool however this is because documents \nthat were not found by the initial \nranking function have no chance of being \nre-ranked and I think this one so the \nidea is you retrieve say 100 documents \nre-rank and then you have the top 10 and \nI use the top 10 as query to get say \nanother 10 and then blow it back up to \n100. so I think this is a little \ncounterintuitive at first you might \nthink like okay the newest neighbors to \nthe query aren't they the nearest \nneighbors to each other but they're \nactually not because of this High \ndimensional space so you know the \nnearest neighbors the query document one \ntwo three four five the nearest \nneighbors to document one might be like \ndocument seven document 13 and then \ndocuments not even in the list like 81 \nor you know whatever so you expand the \nlist and then you have more candidates \nto re-rank and it's a really neat \nheuristic that improves the results on a \nlot of these techniques like the M25 Dr \nquery Colbert and splade \ncool so the next idea is another \nre-ranking strategy that I thought was \nreally interesting and different from \nkind of just the binary classification \nquery document uh put it to a binary \nrelevance label this is the idea of \nusing language models to score the \nlikelihood of the input question \nconditioned on a retrieved passage so \nyou train your language model by \nconcatenating your data set of document \nand query and you know language models \njust predict the Mast out token but the \nway that a language model predicts the \nmask down token is by assigning a \nprobability to each of the next words so \nsay the sequence we estimate log P of Q \ngiven Z sub I using a pre-trained mask \nit puts a 85 on language and then it has \nthis massive distribution of \nprobabilities on all sorts of other \nwords so what you're doing is you're \ngoing to multiply out the probabilities \nof the query as you say have the \ndocument and then you go mask massive s \nand you're putting in the probability of \nthe uh of the passages that you've \nretrieved and you can use this to \nre-rank the passages based on the \nprobabilities of their likelihood coming \nout of the language model so I thought \nthat was another cool idea and the show \nhow that this improves over the \ncontributor the DPR model compared to \nthis idea with the re-ranking the \nRetriever with the language model \nso another kind of cool idea like this \nthis idea of you know maybe taking the \npassages input and then outputting the \nquery and inverting the process is this \npaper decoding a neural retrievers \nlatent space for query suggestion we \nlearned a query decoder that given a \nlatent representation generates the \ncorresponding query so you have some \nkind of gold paragraph like this \nIllinois election 2018 the general \nelection will be held whatever so you \nthen hit it with a sentence Transformer \nand now you have the vector and now you \ndecode from the vector the query that \nwould match with that paragraph so it's \nnot an obvious thing that say in bm25 \nsearch you have pseudo-relevance \nfeedback where you know how much weight \nyou could put on the keywords to have \nmatched the paragraph but it's not so \neasy to invert the space in the neural \nspace where you have to generate it into \na natural language query like this so \nI'm not sure uh yet what this is useful \nfor they have ideas like you Traverse \nthe latent space from the original query \nand try to have like an ensembling of \nnearby queries that are similar to this \nlatent space but generally I think it \ncould just be an idea that helps you get \na sense of what's going on with your \nmodels as you upload documents and it \nsays queries that would match with it \nmaybe it gives you some insight into how \nto query it \nmaybe maybe we could use this for uh \ngenerating queries for Jeopardy right so \nif you have an answer it's like hey uh \nfind me the question that will go well \nwith that \nyeah so you could have like a vector \nsearch engine Jeopardy you know like you \ncould have few instances of widget maybe \nZen can set them up on distributed nodes \nand then each of them can ask the right \nquestion \nyeah exactly we're making the language \nmodels play Jeopardy and answer what was \nthe question rather than \nhey what could go wrong right okay \ncool so what the next topic I want to \nget into is an update with Gina ai's \nfine tuner so there's very interesting \nspace in model training software we have \nlike Keras tensorflow pie torch for \ntraining our models and it requires a \nbit of knowing how to get the data \nloader how to get the optimization Loop \nDefine the model architecture code and \nGina ai's fine tuner has created this \nway of pipelining the document array \nwhich is where you put your uh query \ndocument labeled examples particularly \nfor multimodal image text captions and \naccessing a lot of these features use \nthe train clip like uh the wiseft \nrobustness turret there's a lot of \nthings that are built into the fine \ntuner and so here's some results that \nthey uh present in their share with \ntheir in their blog post about the \nupdates with this Flickr AK 8000 3200 \n000 and bang massive improvement from \nthe AK and retrieval so uh you know \nyou're you have a text caption you're \nsearching for an image and if you have \nsome some kind of really particular data \nset I think this kind of domain \nadaptation achieved through fine tuning \nmodel training software that makes this \neasy I think it's incredibly exciting so \nand then we see more modest improvements \non Flickr 30k and Ms Coco so you know \nthis is building on the clip Baseline \nwhich is a pretty General model but I \nthink this is super exciting for domain \nadaptation in general \nso now we have a Conor if you jump to \nthe next one we actually have an \ninteresting question from the Tien \nI it sounds like there's some plus ones \nalso on building the idea of Jeopardy \nwith AI based engine so hey \nyou you maybe you spoke too soon that \nyou didn't know how to use it we might \neven have just uh came up with you know \nwhat to do yeah I got something I have \nto do cool cool um awesome okay so uh \ngive it a roller now so now we're kind \nof pivoting into more things that aren't \nas particular to search but in this \nGeneral space of large language models \nso Google is back at it with another \namazing language model uh they've \nalready trained 540 billion parameter \nthis Palm model three times the \nparameter count of gbt3 and now what \nthey're doing is they're training this \nmodel with instruction fine-tune tasks \nand I mean you plus 9.4 on average \nmassive multitask just unreal ability \nfor a large language model so let's kind \nof start about like what is instruction \nso this kind of is it's like this Chain \nof Thought thing uh well actually let me \nstart the story with T5 so before the T5 \nTransformer people would use totally \ndifferent architectures for different \nnatural language processing tasks like \nnatural language inference good question \nanswering text specification they would \nall you know have a different way of \ncompressing it into a classification \nlayer then T5 said hey how about we just \nlanguage model this let's just as the \nprefix a question answering then give it \nthe input and then mask and then the \nmask will be the answer or the mask \nwould be yes or no for binary \nclassification and so on So You unify \nall language tasks into language \nmodeling and now they have all sorts of \nways of of mapping tasks into the \ndescription of the task so you know \nobviously with gpt3 in context few shot \nlearning you give it input output \nexamples with some description of the \ntask as well now they and so instruction \nfine tuning is kind of similar they also \nhave that with like give the rationale \nbefore answering so not only answer it \nbut explain yourself and then Chain of \nThought fine tuning which is like this \nis how you would explain yourself so if \nit's something like you know I have 23 \napples I gave you 20. you say Okay 23 \nminus 20. I have three stuff like this \nso what they did is they have this just \nincredible diversity of tasks that they \nfine tune this one model with and it's \nobviously a massive model \nso the next Super interesting thing in \nlet in large language models is large \nlanguage models can self-improve \nand this is the same idea as this Chain \nof Thought thing so again with Chain of \nThought the question is Stefan goes to a \nroom with his family they order an \nappetizer that costs ten dollars and \nfour entrees that are twenty dollars \neach if they tip twenty percent of the \ntotal what is the total amount of money \nthat they spend so what you do with \nChain of Thought is you break up that \nquestion you say okay the appetizer \ncosts ten dollars the entrees cost ten \ndollars each so four times twenty and so \non so the way that language models work \nagain and then this comes back to the \nthe Jeopardy thing and say using this to \ndo re-ranking is as it's doing this \noutput it has a probability for each of \nthese words so you know the is like say \n75 appetizers like 60 of The Next Step \ncost is like 90 and so you can do \ndifferent decoding paths through large \nlanguage language models in general so \nsay greedy to coding is you just take \nthe maximum probability of each step you \ncan have beam search all these kind of \nthings for decoding pathways through the \noutput so this idea of self-improving \nmeans at the end the model might it \ntakes different paths to get there you \nsee how like 90 times 1.2 compared to 90 \nplus 18 but in the end they have the \nsame answer so this consistency is used \nto filter the output and then use this \nas additional training data for the \nlanguage model so output 1 and output 3 \nare then concatenated to this question \nand then the language model does some \nadditional training by language modeling \nthat \nand other incredible idea for further \nimproving the performance of these \nlanguage models \nokay so then just another thing that I \nfind this research in like iterative \nwriting to be extremely interesting so I \nquickly want to present this idea as \nwell where instead of again just having \na language model say greedily decode a \nstory you have this iterative plan draft \nrewrite and edit and I think it's really \ninteresting how you you know they break \nthis down into plan it generates a \nsetting giving a premise it generates \ncharacters they have this kind of \nKnowledge Graph extraction for factual \nconsistency within the story you know \nstart writing the story and then you \nhave the rewrite where you have this \ncoherence and relevance ranking so this \nis kind of a part where this whole \nranking search pipeline thing comes in \nto filtering the potential decodings of \nthe language model ensuring factual \nconsistency and overall I just think \nit's an incredibly interesting idea for \ngenerating long stories of language \nmodels \nso then let's talk about the other way \nof doing language modeling this is the \nso these these three ideas are like \nthese you know massive language models \nyou put like 100 billion parameters you \njust compress all the data into the \nparameters and language model compared \nto retrieval augmented language modeling \nwhere you retrieve you have the query uh \nyou have the input you use that as a \nquery to retrieve some information and \nthen you condition your generation on \nthat retrieved information so in the \nlast movie error episode we talked about \nFacebook ai's Atlas model and \nparticularly what they're doing is \nthey're saying can those can those \nretrieval augmented language models also \nachieve few shot learning where you give \nit a few examples and it learns a task \nbecause that's one of the core cells of \nthese large language models uh now we're \nexploring can they do common sense \nreasoning so the problem with common \nsense reasoning is it's a different kind \nof retrieval task so the question is \nonly after learning you can gain \nknowledge true like these little Common \nSense things and the question was really \nlike can the retrieval generate relevant \nthings or what \nthe next thing is using this kind of \nretrieval augmented strategy for \nmultimodal information I think this is \nalso extremely interesting so you have \nquestions like what shape is the \npediment used by Capitol Hill in DC and \nso you need to kind of retrieve this \nimage and then you look at it and you go \ntriangular shape pediment the way they \ndo this is they use the uh the \nembeddings of images and the embeddings \nof text they put that into the same \ndocument index and then you know fusion \nand decoder style retrieve and read \ngenerate answers train it with uh with \nlike these vqa data sets \nokay then finally the last thing is the \nmassive text embedding Benchmark and \nit's about having Universal text \nembeddings applicable to a wide variety \nof tasks we love using it for retrieval \nwe think about this a lot you know you \nsay fact verification you have a claim \ncan you retrieve the evidence for this \nclaim we can also use embeddings for say \nuh summarization where you have this \nsimilarity score of the embeddings \nbetween the long document and the \npotential summaries you could have a \npair of uh of sequences that you compare \nthe embeddings to to do some kind of \nclassification with \nand all sorts of things like bitex \nminings they say you use embeddings for \ntranslation by you say something in \nEnglish embed it in English nearest \nneighbor in the French index that's \ngoing to be the translation so is a \ncollection of a ton of different tasks \nton of different data sets a ton of \ndifferent languages as well so really \ninteresting way of seeing all the things \nwe can do with embedding based models \nand then you know it puts a scale for \ncomparing GTR with mpnet with our mini \nLM with uh all that Specter not our like \nwe developed it at we did but this is \njust a common sentence Transformer \nlightweight use it a lot uh Specter for \na lot of these things on the same scale \nuh so thank you so much for listening to \nthis uh please let us know anything you \nthought was interesting and I hope you \ncheck out webe to learn more about the \nweekday Adventist search engine \nexcellent thank you for this uh huge \noverview Connor uh that was really good \nand basically just for everyone in the \naudience to know uh how what how \nimportant this segment was uh to Conor \nhe literally has a taxi uh about to \narrive in half an hour so uh uh you know \nlike he was still in this he's still in \nthis and like yeah I can still make it \non plane and fly over \num to to Italy because like a bunch of \nus like pretty much everyone in the \ncompany most of the people in the \ncompany going to meet in Italy soon uh \nso yeah thanks Connor for taking the \ntime \num I I know you're going to share some \nof the materials as well right \num \noh sorry uh yes yeah uh Twitter thread \nthat has the links to each of the papers \nif that's what you're looking for and \nyeah I think we'll continue thinking \nabout how we want to share this if we \nwant to write something or something but \nhopefully the just the links is enough \nnow what's your Twitter handle Connor \nC short and 30 I'll I'll put it in the \nYouTube chat \nlet's do that so yes if any of you wants \nto actually get the you know the list of \neverything that Connor covered uh yeah \nyou should definitely follow him on \nTwitter and uh without a say you should \nfollow each of us as well uh but I would \ndefinitely say like yeah follow semi \nTwitter handle and wavy8 as well so I \nthink that's pretty much it from us this \nis all we had to cover for today uh \nthank you all for listening uh thank you \nfor uh my co-host uh you all did an \namazing job \num any final words anyone \nthanks for listening everybody thank you \nthank you thanks a lot so let's do a \ncollective wave waving what I'm going to \ndo thank you bye I'll see you next time \n[Laughter] \nbye everyone \n", "type": "Video",
