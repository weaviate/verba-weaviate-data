{"text": "New hybrid search ranking algorithm: https://weaviate.io/blog/weaviate-1-20-release#new-hybrid-search-ranking-algorithm ... \nforeign \n[Music] \nthis is super exciting we finally hit \ndouble digits we I have a great crew \nhere with me so I've got Derek Zen JP \nand Philip so Zen and JP you already \nknow Dirk and Philip they're new to \nVivid air so it's super great to have \nyou guys with us and this is super \nexciting \num so yes as always thank you for \nwatching and listening it's always great \nto see you all keep coming back for more \nand if you like this kind of content yes \nplease subscribe and then then you \nalways get a notification and not just \nfor vivid air but we do loads of really \ncool stuff with podcasts and various fun \nvideos and we also have some more new \nideas around tutorials Etc so it's \ndefinitely worth subscribing to our \nChannel and of course one of the best \nthings about this kind of content and \nvideos that we are creating it is live \ntherefore you can ask questions you know \nso don't feel don't be shy feel free to \nask questions always as we go and we'll \ntry to help them out but also if you \ndon't have questions but you just want \nto say hi and tell us where you are \nwatching us from uh then this is also a \ngood opportunity to introduce yourself \nto the rest of the community community \nright so today we have a few really cool \ntopics to cover so first off we will be \ntalking about multi-modal models and \napplications so JP sorry Zen we'll talk \nabout that uh the next one we have \nAutoCAD feature so that's something that \nis brand new that was added to viviate \nit with like the 120 release so JP and \nDerek will talk about this \num then we have new hybrid search \nranking algorithm and that's also like \nsomething that GP and Doug will continue \ntalking about then we we talk about PQ \nand risk scoring this is actually a \npretty cool topic that Zen will cover so \nif you're interested in like various \ntypes of maybe indexing and the kind of \nclever stuff that we do behind the \nscenes to make within more performant \nand you know more memory Savvy even or \nyou know to get the best out of your \nvector database this is a really cool \ntopic and then last but not least we'll \nhave like a really cool demo by JP \naround like the knowledge base app so \nthis should be really really cool and \none more reminder you know please \nsubscribe you know like if you arrive \nlate you know make sure to subscribe so \nuh and basically let's have fun during \nthis session \nso \num let's kick it off with Zen and Zen \nokay what can you tell us about the \nmultimodal multi-modal models and \nassociations so let me let me kind of \njustify why I wanted to talk about this \nuh in this episode first \num I've been on this hype train of \nmultimodal models recently I've been \nreading all the papers in this field \num I've been looking at implementations \nfor uh Summer State some of the state of \nthe art multimodal models from from meta \nfrom Carnegie Mellon and I wrote about \nthis in the previous blog \nand I wanted to talk about this as far \nas how how this is going to impact uh \nwhat we're releasing would leviate going \nforward \num so let me step back and let's talk \nabout what multimodal models are right \num the only multimodal model that we \nhave right now in weaviate is the clip \nmodel \nand it's multimodal because it \nunderstands multiple modalities of data \nright you can pass in text and it will \nembed it into vectors you can pass it \nimages and it's going to embed it into \nthe same Vector space and the whole \npoint of multimodality is that you can \nactually understand and search data \nacross modality so you can give it an \nimage and and then obtain images or text \nyou can give it a text query and you can \nobtain text or images back so you can do \nthis cross modal search \num and so this really excited me and I \nstarted exploring new papers around this \nand now what people are trying to do is \nuh go go beyond just text and images and \nthe motivation here is of course as \nhumans we use all of our modalities to \nunderstand a data point where if you go \nto the park and you look at uh and you \nsee a dog passing by you can see them \nnot just in images but the the time \nseries of them moving you can smell them \nif they're close by enough you can see \nuh you can hear them there's all these \nmodalities that go in and into our brain \nand that's how we understand a dog \nand the power of this is that every \nmodality is adding a specific amount of \ninformation \nanother example of this is I was \nrecently on the plane um flying to \nSeattle \nlast month and I didn't have uh these um \nthough the wired headphones I had the \nBluetooth headphones so I watched the \nentire movie without listening to it and \nI got pretty much all of it so humans \nare very good multimodal reasoning \nengines where I can show you a movie \nwithout giving you the audio behind it \nand you'd still understand pretty much \nall of it because we can fill in the \nblanks of the missing modality \num and so the main thinking behind this \nis if we want powerful reasoning engines \nwhich these large language models are we \nneed for them to understand other \nmodalities of data right now they only \nunderstand language and some of them \nunderstand uh image so like the new Bard \nmodel \nunderstands images \num but in the future what we'd like for \nthem to do is understand audio \nunderstand moving time frame so video \nunderstand maybe even motion so if you \nlook at your phone there's a bunch of \naccelerometers and gyroscopes in here uh \nwhat if you could give the data from \nThose sensors to a multimodal model and \nthen get it to understand what type of \nmotion the human is performing running \nwalking all sorts of interesting stuff \nso \num I went down this rabbit hole and then \nwe started reading this paper called \nimage bind from meta and we're in the \nprocess of uh implementing this into \ninto Eva and there's going to be more \ninformation soon \num but the main idea behind this now is \nthat you can take any type of data embed \nit into Eva and the vector space is \ngoing to represent all sorts of \nmodalities now \num \nand then you can do cross-modal search \nso you could pass in you could literally \ntalk to your database before you could \nwrite in text and you would get relevant \nanswers back but now you could record \nyourself and your query could be an \naudio recording your query could be a \nvideo your query could be \num could be motion sensors actually as \nwell so you can take a motion sensor \nvectorize that data point and then \nretrieve back any of the relevant uh \ndata points back hey Zen um so on the on \nthe topic because I think there's like \nso many things that you could probably \nrecognize and in terms of modalities so \nuh back in the days when I was doing \nlike way more more public speaking I got \nthis gadget so it's something that you \nput on have you seen it yes yes I have \nto say so this this oh you have the same \nso this thing actually you can uh like \nfeels like as your different joints and \nyour bones move inside so if I make this \ngesture this gesture show you some \nfingers you know I'm not gonna show you \nyou do this all that that's kind of like \none of the modalities so you could if I \ndo this you could kind of translate \nmodality of like oh yeah this person is \nhappy or something right if I show this \nlike oh this person's angry so this \ncould be yet another example like \nstrange modality and uh yeah so yeah \nthat that device by the way is from a \ncompany in Canada and it and it \nrecognizes uh muscular activity uh in \nyour arm and this is similar to what uh \nthe the people at meta are doing with \ntheir image buying model one of the \nmodalities that they process is \naccelerometer data \nso because there was a time where meta \nwas super interested in these special \ninput devices and they they were there \nwere a lot of Buzz around these so that \nthey take over I'm not sure if it was \nthis startup but at least they \num yeah to get a replacement for for my \nfor a computer mouse \nyeah I'm not sure if they bought this \none but I I know this particular device \nthat Sebastian is wearing \num yeah but they are they are looking at \nthe new interface right the whole player \non the VR they want to be the next \nscreen \num no but this could potentially be one \nof the modalities right if I'm moving my \narm like this or like this what is the \nclosest thing in Vector space to this \nmovement action \num yeah and I really like your your \nexample in your blog course around this \ninfant which is them growing up and uh \ngetting a higher level of abstraction \nand then being so like like fine tuning \nor having a model which is then \ngeneralizing better so if it's uh if you \nhave more data \nyeah the other thing that's really \ninteresting about this is that you can \ndo better classification if you have \nmultiple modalities yes right exactly it \nwas the point yeah like if if I show you \na really weird image you can only \ninspect the weirdness or the anomaly uh \ncomponent of that image through the \nimage modality but if I show you a \nreally weird \ndata point through six different \nmodalities you can you can view it from \ndifferent modalities and say okay it's \nabnormal in these modalities but it's \nnormally in the other modalities so you \ncan do anomaly detection much better \nacross modalities which is why humans \num like if something seems really weird \nlike you get a weird feeling you can't \nexplain it it might be that all the \nother modalities are normal one modality \nis going off the charts right so the \nnumber of applications you can do with \nthis is really amazing I'm really \nexcited to see what people do with this \nand one of the main modules the clip \nmodule people love so I'm hoping they \ncan take this new image bind module and \nbuild on top of it one more technical \ndetail by the way so in image bind they \nactually start off with the clip module \nand they use the clip module to localize \nand and bring together all of the other \nmodalities so if you have an image of a \nlion and the word lion \nin the clip module in the the clip data \nmodel \nthose two vectors are already going to \nbe closer together and now if you \nproject in the sound of a lion roaring \nthey use examples that are similar \nversus dissimilar to bind the the um the \nembedding space together across these \nmodalities that's why it's called image \nbind because they're using concepts of \nimages to bind the other modalities \ncloser together \num so hopefully the the idea is that you \ncould still use the bind model if you're \nonly doing image and word search and \nthat would work just as well but if you \nwanted to do audio search down the road \ngoing with the bind rather than the clip \nmodel would just be a better idea now \ncool so you can go on I was gonna say so \nthen from uh like from a weeviate user \nperspective you can now is it correct to \nsay that you can now kind of \num embed information or like vectorize \ninformation in any of the N modalities \nthis model would support like it kind of \nup to end uh different modalities in \nyour data point right \nyeah if you if you have the modality if \nyou have the data point for that \nmodality which is one of the main \nchallenges of the space Philip go ahead \nyou were saying \num but it's limited to 10 modalities are \nuh no this one has six modalities so it \nhas image audio it has accelerometer it \nhas depth and it has uh video and it's \ngot heat \nradar so um okay because the the high \nmodality multi-transformer that hits \nyeah the high mmt from Carnegie Mellon \nthat has 10 different modalities that \none is super interesting as well the \ndifference between these two is that \nthis model uh \nBill the the bind model built a model \nper modality so you have a model that \nunderstands Vision a model that \nunderstands audio and then they bind \nthem together the high mmt one is one \nmodel that they can keep on adding \nmodalities to and the more modalities \nyou add it looks at what information \nwhat incremental information you're \ngiving to the model and it says okay \nthis is a useful modality because now I \nknow something that I didn't from the \nother mod the mod modalities that I had \nand so that builds one model up and it's \nit's a lot more scalable cool so it's \nlike a Voltron of older models nice \nexactly the more the more modalities you \ngive it the better it becomes and you \ncan give it all sorts of modalities they \nthey went into like structured document \nunderstanding that that model can \nunderstand like a word uh documents as \nwell \nso what are the use cases that you think \nwe could do with like maybe database \nbecause like the thing I I can think of \nis like hey if I left if I were to \nvectorize maybe a video and then I could \ndo either search based on what I can see \nin the images just like you were saying \nyou could watch a movie without even \nlike putting headphones on or I could \njust search based on audio right so \nlet's say I search for a fight scene and \nthen you know maybe you could see it or \nmaybe there's just a fight that you can \noverhear right so yeah so it's kind of \ninteresting but what will be other \nexamples you would you want to use it \nfor I think probably the most relevant \napplication would be performing searches \nlet's say you have a data point that \nthat you have three different modalities \nfor right you have text for a modality \nyou have video for a modality as well as \nthe audio for that modality which if you \ntake any YouTube video you have all \nthese three modalities you have the \ntranscription you have the video itself \nas well as the frames and you have the \nthe sound recording for this you could \ndo you could vectorize all three of the \nthese data points as separate queries \nand then you could do more refined \nsearch before you could say okay show me \nanything that looks like this image now \nyou could say I have this image or video \nrepresented as three different \nmodalities show me a more accurate \nrepresentation of what this uh what this \nis in multimodal space \num I I think that would be one really \ncool application \num the other application could also be \nif you only have one modality you can \nlook for other modalities uh as output \nfrom your vector database if you have a \nlarge enough data set \num this was one of the challenges that \nthey talked about in the paper where \nit's very difficult to find Rich \nmultimodal data sets How likely is it \nthat you have the picture of a lion the \nsound of a lion and then the motion of a \nline in accelerometer data it's quite \nrare So training this thing was a bit of \na nightmare I think they used seven or \neight different data sets that they \nstitched together to even train this \nthing to begin with \nbecause I think that the the use case in \nthis case wouldn't necessarily even have \nto be where I have a video and I \nabstract three modalities from it what \nyou could do is like have a collection \nwhere you just throw all my videos all \nmy mp3s and and all my pictures on all \nmy PDFs and then I can you know search \nthrough all of them because that's like \nthe ml model can understand all of them \nso I don't have to have five different \ncollections I could actually just lump \nit in it's like just search to my \nunstructured data right like it's all \nthere yeah exactly \ncool \ndid I hijack you did I hijack your train \nof thoughts \noh no I'm good uh any other questions uh \nwe can take those when can we have it \nah that took it we're aiming for the \nwe're aiming for for the next release \nbut no promises yet right uh we're just \ngoing through finalizing it testing it \num well there will be another blog post \naround all the cool things that you can \ndo with it \num all sorts of multimodal searches I'm \nreally excited about that but um yeah \nthe next release is the we're aiming for \nthat but uh so it sounds like if someone \nmashed the Subscribe button on the \nYouTube channel they'll probably get \nsome notifications about videos or \ncontent about it in the future \nthat will for sure happen and if you do \nsubscribe you might uh it might come out \nearlier no promises but that might just \nhappen it's a good excuse to uh give \nanother call out \num and then while before we switch \ntopics we have somebody saying hi from \nColombia which is uh code ego \nso that's good to see people always \nsaying hi you know like we hope you \nenjoy it if you have any questions uh \ndrop us a question or just you know keep \nsaying hi or send us encouragement so \nthat we keep going \nthank you \nvery cool audience from all over the \nplace \nI know I know it's it's nice to see \npeople from everywhere \nperfect in this case might be good more \na good moment to go to AutoCAD feature \nuh so I will leave you Dirk and JP to \nhandle it cool I mean um the last \nrelease was so jam-packed with features \nright so we talked about it uh last \npodcast with Etienne and he's one of \nbeing on Connor's podcast talk about it \nas well but yeah we didn't have time to \ncover some of the other features that \nwould be a good time and one of them was \num autocut and we've got Derek here from \nthe core team is that the right yeah \ngroup term and uh yeah so Derek and I \nwork together to to write about it um so \nI thought I'd lean on Dirk to uh sort of \nthe hard questions like hey what is \nAutoCAD \num can you just tell us a little bit \nlike at a very high level Dirk about \nwhat it is \nuh yeah so you do a search you get \nresults back and then \num they often get bad after a while so \nwe have one two three good results and \nthen the bunch that don't have good \nscores that are not really relevant to \nyour search and you don't really want to \nshow them to your users and \num obviously you could you could play \naround with the limits to try to only \ninclude the ones that you really want to \nshow and not include the irrelevant ones \nbut it's not really possible to set the \nlimit to a value that works everywhere \nso what AutoCAD is doing is it depends \njumps in the score \nso you have I say let's say one 0.9 \n0.85 and then the scores go down to 0.5 \n0.4 so on and then you do a cut at the \njump in this course and throw away the \nrest of the results and only for the \ngood ones and you can set how many of \nthe jumps you want to do \nand \num \nimportant who those that you want so \nmaybe for your use case you want to go \nfor the second jump or the third to get \neverything that might be relevant or you \nwant to really do a hard cut off and \nonly show the best ones and then you use \none \nyeah I think it's really cool because \nlike obviously uh you know Vector search \nworking on similarity you have to \nspecify some some sort of threshold to \nget results back whether it's you know \njust hey get me 10 results or results \nwithin this distance from my query and \nthat's a little bit painful sometimes \nbecause you have to uh figure out what \nyour threshold is and what I really find \ninteresting about AutoCAD is that you \nknow you create this natural groupings \ntoo as well as like thresholds you can \ngo hey give me two like you said groups \nof results that are like could end up \nbeing not necessarily close together but \nyou know \num they're gonna become natural \ngroupings of this first group is within \nthis threshold and then kind of get this \nouter ring of results and then so on as \nyou go it kind of like this nice mapping \nof vector distances so yeah I think I \nthink it's really cool and hopefully uh \nour users kind of find it useful as well \nbecause for me when I you know do demos \nand people are like oh I see you're \ngetting eight results back or three \nresults back why did you do that and I \ngo because that's how many feet on my \nscreen is usually the answer for demos \nbut \nit's really hard question to answer when \npeople say things like oh what threshold \nshould I use if they're using a distance \nnumber and it's like how long is a piece \nof string whereas I think AutoCAD really \nlends to kind of natural groupings of \nthese these results so that's really \ncool \num and and \nyou kind of need uh result sets that \nlead to these groupings right like you \nkind of need some meaningful distances \nfrom results which is why it works well \nwith Vector search \nyes basically you take the distance we \nget from the vector search or bm25 \nsearch and that's the input to Auto \nAutoCAD we don't use anything else \num and it's really simple inside so it \nbasically it's a very simple way of \ncalculating derivative and it uses that \nto to detect the jumps and then cuts off \nwhen other people are talking about \nusing some complex models to do that and \nit probably works better for some cases \nbut it's a very very cheap way to get \nuseful results and obviously can always \nbe improved later \nyeah is the idea then that if I run a \nsearch and I get like a couple of great \nones and then I have like a bunch of \nlike good ones then the good one gets \ncut out because you know they're not as \ngood as the great ones but if I only get \ngood ones then the good ones will be \nshown because there's nothing better \nright \nexactly so it doesn't look at any \nabsolute values it only looks at it's a \nrelative thing right \nsorry again it's a relative thing so you \ncan Define I want to the first or the \nbest ones and then there's maybe some \nsome space between them and then I went \nalso the second ranking and the third \nranking and I can \ndo a config thing that I want to First \npairs or the first two pairs exactly \nthat's how it works yeah I mentioned \nthat it doesn't know how good your \nscores are so you get some scores back \nand you don't know if a 0.8 is great or \nnot great so it can't do any absolute \nranking you can only look at the \nrelative \ndistances between the different objects \nand then group them by by using these \njumps in this course and then cuts it \noff depending on how you how you \nconfigure it it's sort of like when you \ngo for a holiday and you're looking for \na hotel and then sometimes you if you \nbook in early there's like loads of \ngreat options so you don't want like the \ncrappy hotels to pop up but when you're \nlike booking like on the day when you're \nflying you go like okay at least show me \nthe average ones don't cut them out but \ndon't show like the ones where you get \nmurdered I'm also taking this tent and \nthe highway yeah yeah \nso like Vegas can be chooses right \nyeah I guess yeah because when we were \ntalking about what image to put in the \nblog I said um let's fill out this \nreally obviously the horrible sketch uh \nthat it was like wave yet as a robot \ngrabbing you and like some sets of \nresults so it's like oh it's basically \ntelling we've yet hey get me one set of \nresults or two sets of results uh how \ngood are they don't know whether it just \ngoes and grabs them for you as it's \nconvenient so yeah the hotel in that \nwhich is quite funny uh quite good \nsomeone sounds like someone who's been \non holiday recently yeah but also very \nspecific to to your role Sebastian or \nlike looking for a hotel for the same \nday \nno no I'm actually a pretty good planner \nSo like um it only happened once in my \nlife when uh when I had to book a hotel \non uh on the same day but that's a not a \nstory live on the screen \nand \num uh I think that kind of leads in well \nwith our next discussion which was going \nto be I have one more question this is \nsuper important so every time I learned \nabout a new feature the first thing that \nI think of is how how could I break it \nor \ntry to understand it it's a \ntroublemaker's end so \num you talked about using the derivative \num is there a minimum threshold to the \nderivative let's say I ask for 10 \nanswers back and they're all great so \nthe derivative is not going to be very \nhigh right it's going to be a relatively \nflat derivative and I ask for one cut it \nwill it just make an arbitrary cut \nsomewhere or how do we handle that no um \nbasically if your scores are very linear \nand there is no no jump in them then it \nwill not cut off anything it could also \nbe if your results are all bad \n[Music] \nokay so there is some some minimum \nthreshold for the derivative needs to be \nthat high before the cut to happen not \nan absolute threshold it kind of it \ndetects that the that the derivative \nchanges okay \num \nI think it's called the knee in English \nI'm actually not 100 sure but it's a \nvery very fast but kind of crude way of \ncalculating it \num but it basically if if you don't have \njumps that are large in your data set it \ndoesn't really do anything because if \nyou can't really group them if they're \non a line or something okay it doesn't \nmake sense to to to to say this is the \nfirst group this is the second group \nokay makes sense \nawesome JP now you can do fine oh thanks \na question \num yes no that's a really good question \num yeah and then to that point right \nabout about \num how those groupings are derived \nthat's led to a change in the \num I always get this term wrong so \nhybrid Fusion ranking algorithm did I \nget that right deck \nso close \nPhilip you want to say something \num \nnope I just want to ask because of \nfusion the word Fusion \nbut I'm pretty sure you elaborate on it \nso relatively confusion yeah \num do you just want to share my screen \nSebastian \nthere you go so this is a picture from \nthe blog post and this is how hybrid \nsearch works so hybrid search be doing a \nvector search and a bm25 search and each \nof them have their own scores \nand now we want to combine the results \nfrom both different searches problem is \nthe scores are completely different \nthings and you can't just add them up it \njust doesn't make any sense because they \nmeasure different things a vector search \nyou get distances and for bm25 search \nyou get something out of a formula which \nmethod like the frequency of your term \nand how many documents you have and the \naverage lengths and a bunch of other \nthings that go in there so you can't \njust add them up \nand \num \nthe methods we used before to add \nresults up just look on the rank of each \nresult in the in the individual search \nand then use the rank to fuse the \nresults that's why it's called Fusion \nand the old algorithm was called ranked \nfusion and just to kind of show how it \nhow it works this is a very simple \nnotebook very hacked together so don't \nlook at my code too much but \num what what rank Fusion does it looks \nat the rank in your search results and \nthen assigns the score to it so the \nfirst results in your this is the actual \nformula for it \nso the first results in your search gets \nthe score one divided by 0.60 plus one \nwhich happens to be \n0.1 \ns0.01 blah blah blah blah doesn't really \nmatter the second one gets a bit less \nthe third one gets a bit less it doesn't \nmatter what the scores actually are only \nthe rank counts \nand you do this for your for your \ntwo searches and then you just add the \nnumbers up and that's your final score \nyou get in the output and just to show \nyou the what that means so here are two \ndifferent input scores \nyou know here in the first one you have \na really good one another really good \none and then a better one when the \nsecond one you have a really good one \nand then two bad ones right pizza \ncrap and these ones are really good but \nboth lead to the same results with \nranked Fusion because this is the first \nrank this is the second rank it's the \nthird Rank and nothing else matters \nyeah I I printed out below what the what \nthe ranked Fusion scores would be for \nthese two scores and it's exactly the \nsame \nand um \nnow to compare the old one the old way \nof using things with the new one I \num made a small example here but before \nI go into the I just want to explain how \nhow I do it now or maybe first the \nproblem so the problem is with this you \nget a very regular scores out of your \nFusion algorithm and if you have very \nregular scores you don't have any jumps \nin your scores and so AutoCAD doesn't \nwork \nthat is what we just discussed this is \nit's not exactly linear but it's very \nclose to being linear and \num so the AutoCAD algorithm cannot find \nthe jump in these scores and so it will \nmostly give everything back and maybe \ncut something off at the end that's \nthat's a really low low rank in both \nsearches \nand \num now what new algorithm is doing is \nit's \nnormalizes the scores between zero and \none \nso you get your scores from vm25 your \nscores from from the vector search and \nyou just say the higher score is one the \nlowest one is zero and everything will \nbe normalized in between according to \nthe relative distances between them \nso if we scroll down to these these \nexamples so here the the higher score is \n500 the lowest one is zero to zero nine \nso this one will become one this one \nwill become zero and the other one's \nrelative to that so this will be a \nreally low number and so on for the \nvector search this will become a one \nthis will become a zero and because this \nis so close the maximum score this will \nbecome like a 0.9 whatever it doesn't \nreally matter in detail \nand what you have with that is the the \nrelative distances in your \nscores from the individual search other \ninsurance course yeah Frank Fusion you \nonly have to rank in the final score \neverything else get lost so you don't \nknow if a result was \nalmost as good as the first one or \nalmost as bad as the worst one you only \nlook at the rank and with the new one \nyou have like the relative \num \nyeah the relative distribution of the \nscores also in your final result \nwhat's important is what you don't have \nyou still don't know if 500 here is a \ngood one \nyou know this could be your best score \nyou get but it could still be really bad \nyou don't know if 500 is a good score \nand a bad score \num \nand now we can kind of with this made up \nexample so the first document of 500 \nsecond one for the six and so on and \nVector score is also second document as \na six false documentation 5.98 I just \nwant to show the outcome for both \nalgorithm so here we do it for ranked \nFusion so we just look at the rank of \neach document we sum up \nthe score for the given Rank and this is \nwhat you get in the end \nyou see the second one is the best one \nand then you have the other ones very \nclose together and only the one that was \nworse in all in both searches at the end \nbut if you if you look at the input the \nfirst one was so much better in the \nkeyword search than the other ones \nand here it's it's on the first rank \nyeah the fourth rank but the the scores \nare almost the same so it's still a \nreally good result here but you only get \nit on second place \nnow if you go to the relative scope \nFusion the one is the first result right \nbecause it gets a really high score from \nthe vector search and from the keyword \nsearch and so if you sum it up you get a \nreally high score together so it's the \nfirst result you get back from the \nvector search then you have this group \nhere \nthat has almost the same score \nand here is the one that was bad in all \nin both searches and if you would run \nAutoCAD here you would get a cut here \nand one here and you get this groups of \nvery good results good results pretty \nbad results \nso I guess it retains a lot more of that \ninformation in the scores right like \nbefore all that was kind of like getting \nlost because all we kept were the \nrankings and what we ended up getting in \nthe hybrid score was either you know I \nkind of found that if it scored well in \none of the other searches you tend to \ncome up to the top whereas here the how \nfar you are I mean because it's still \nrelative so the top results still tend \nto do really well but it was if you're \nthe same if your second result and \nyou're very far away from that top \nresult you don't benefit from that as \nmuch \nyeah exactly yeah I think the the this \njump in the scores is probably the best \nway to see it so I could change that to \nfive and you wouldn't see any change \nhere sorry I need to rerun everything \num \nit looks exactly the same as before \nright I \nthis this discourse now much lower but \nthe the right Fusion is still exactly \nthe same whereas whatever do the same \none here you suddenly get a completely \ndifferent result because now the \nthis score is almost the same as those \ntwo \nbut again now you get all of those first \ngroupings or results probably in your in \nyour uh one group autocut yeah exactly \nyeah that's really neat \num so what are the two ranked Fusion \nmath no hybrid fuchsia method it's \ncalled again \none is called rank Fusion in what is \ncalled relative score of fusion and you \ncan set it with the python client as a \nwhen the hybrid search there's an \nargument Fusion type and there's just an \nenum you can import and then set it to \nrelative score or to ranked and that's \nhow it works and just for graphql it's \nthe same Fusion type and then you put in \none of the two options in \num rank Fusion is the default so the old \none we might change in the future and \nyou'll be very happy to hear if your \nresults get better like what we tested \ngot better with the new Fusion algorithm \nbut it would be great to hear from all \npeople \nyeah I saw that when we ran some \nbenchmarks internally there was some you \nknow like much improved recall results \nwith the hybrid search it was really \ncool and um yeah it's obviously it \ndoesn't like it's still compatible with \nnot setting the result because of the \ndefaults if you don't change anything it \nshould still behave as it did before so \nthat's obviously neat as well for people \nin the I have a question in the example \nhere in the Jupiter notebook the um the \nalpha is 0.5 so both the um the dents \nand the sparse search are equally \nweighted in this example correct \num if I if I change that waiting does \nthat does the re-weighting uh work \nbetter with this relative search as \nopposed to the old research we had \nI think it's more exactly the same so it \nbasically would have a 0.5 or something \nor 0.7 here and here and for the \nrelative \nyear and here but the the base of it is \nexactly the same you still only look at \nthe ranked for rank fusion and you still \nlook at the relative scores for the for \nthe new one okay \nand then is there any reason why I would \nnot want to use this versus the older \nalgorithm \nwell I guess we just wanted to get some \nfeedback for now everything that we have \ntested is better but you never know \nright so it would be creative if people \nsay yes it's better for us and then we \nswitch it over and on for everyone Zayn \nis just creeping its way to how to break \nit yeah I'm just thinking about this \njust seems like a an overall better \nthing it retains more information like \nit just seems like all good I'm \nwondering if there's anything bad about \nthis but apparently so like you said the \ntesting we've done it doesn't it doesn't \nseem that way but this is why the \ncommunity can use it and and tell us and \nwe'll go from there I guess \nexactly sometimes there's stuff you \nhaven't thought of so it's always here \nall the time all the time \ncool thanks dick \num yeah I think that was that was really \ncool and it was cool to for me to sort \nof be like you know writing up about it \nand and yeah everything kind of you said \nas you're showing me this stuff was like \noh this is like x amount better and this \nis my better so uh everyone everything \nseemed really positive when you guys \nwere developing it and and implementing \nit so obviously if anyone has \nexperiences would love to hear about it \num because I guess one of the questions \nI had for you Dirk was set the same as \nZen's like when would you use one \nalgorithm versus the other and at the \nmoment it kind of seems like generally \nwe're kind of keeping the old one for \nlegacy reasons as default but maybe \nwe'll think about moving towards this in \nthe future is that right yeah if we get \ngood feedback and nobody complains that \nthat scores the results are much worse \nthan \nwe will switch it over \nsounds good cool thanks very much so how \ncan I start using it what do I need to \ndo \nyou just if you use the python client \nthat's what you add \nah and like just go to the to the \ndocumentation check for \nFusion ranking methods and then there \nare examples for Python typescripts and \ncraft UL oh it's missing here but it's \nalready implemented so it's also \nwhat the example yeah \num and is there a way to make it a \ndefault \nuh even outside of the query where it's \nlike hey I like it I just I want it \neverywhere or do we just have to use the \nflag every time you just have to set it \nright now for each search \nokay sounds good \nso let's see if Zen can break it before \nthe next movie there \noh it's good that I if I break it then \nwe fix it and then so this type of \nthinking on the limits not just helps \nwith understanding but also good product \nso \nabsolutely in the past I work with this \nguy Frank and uh he he was the like the \ntorment of all the engineers because \nwhenever we release like a new product \nlike our new version of the product he \nalways found like this obscure example \non how to break it so we always had to \nkind of like do uh pre-frank release and \nthen Post front release that was pretty \nfun \nand no matter how much the QA team \ntested the tools like Frank always found \nsomething \nso uh maybe Zen you're the new Frank \nyeah sounds good to me \ncool cool \num all right should we move on to PQ and \nrisk scoring because that sounds like \nit's along the similar subject so uh \nthen what is this all about and um how \ndid we get to hear and give us a story \nyeah so let me start off with \num I'll give a quick intro to what PQ is \nbefore I talk about the rescoring part \nthat we added with this uh 1.20 release \num so I think it was 1.8 \num 1.18 when we initially released \nPQ which stands for product quantization \num and the main motivation behind this \nwas \nnow when you take your unstructured data \nand you vectorize it all of that so the \nthe huge vectors are stored in memory \nand that increases a lot of the memory \nload the requirements of uh what what \nyour what your computer needs to be able \nto run vv8 \num so product quantization basically \nsays for all the vectors that you're \nstoring I'm going to in memory store a \ncompressed version of them and I'm going \nto have the original \nrepresentation of them in disk and the \nway that it works is it'll take your \nvector and it will chunk it up into \nsmaller pieces and for every piece let's \nsay you have a vector that's a hundred \nnumbers long 100 units 100 dimensional \nit'll chunk it up into units that are \nfive numbers five numbers five numbers \nand so you've got a bunch of these kind \nof vector chunks now and then it trains \nan algorithm to say what are the what \nare the average representations of these \nof the first chunk of all of your \nvectors it'll take the second chunk and \nit'll say what is what is the average \nrepresentation of these vectors \num and you can increase that by saying \nokay I want 10 average representations \nfor the second chunk the third chunk the \nfourth chunk so another way to think \nabout it is \nif you if you take a huge Vector it's \nalmost like specifying a person's \nlocation down to the XYZ coordinate \neverywhere so if I wanted to know \nexactly where Sebastian is right now I \nwould give the XYZ coordinate and and \nwherever he is in Europe and then that \nwould be my Vector representation for \nSebastian but what PQ does is it gives \nyou a more coarser representation so we \ncan say okay so I don't really care \nabout whether what XYZ coordinates of \naction is in I only want to know what \nhis home address is or which country \nhe's in or what continent he's in so you \ncan keep on zooming out further but you \nsee the problem now is the farther you \nzoom out the less precise of \nrepresentation that you have for every \nVector so with product quantization you \ncan take an exact vector and you can say \nI don't really care about exactly the \ncoordinates of this Vector I'll look at \nsome average representations of this \nVector the different chunks of this \nVector \num and so forth for that compression you \nlose accuracy you lose recall because \nnow the vectors are not exactly precise \nbut the advantage of this is you can \nsave a lot on RAM you require less \nmemory to store all of these vectors so \nthis is one of the features that we \nimplemented in 1.18 and we've been \nplaying around with it users have been \nusing this usually how this works in \npractice is you need a specific number \nof vectors already in leviate and then \nyou can say use the vectors that are \nthere to approximate what the \ndistribution of vectors looks like and \nthen any new Vector coming in can then \nbe compressed in real time so there was \na portion where I would put in a hundred \nthousand vectors into eviate and then I \nwould enable product quantization and \nthen it would go into read-only mode and \nit would calculate averages of these \nvectors and then when it came out of \nread-only mode the next time I put a \nvector in it would compress that vector \nand it would have the real \nrepresentation of that Vector on disk \nbut only a compressed representation in \nin working memory \nand depending on how much you compress \nand squeeze the vectors you can you can \none tenth of the memory requirements or \n1 100th the memory requirement the more \nyou compress it obviously the more \nrecall and accuracy you're going to lose \nbut now that's a knob that you have \ncontrol over \nuh if you value recall then you don't \ncompress as much or you don't compress \nat all if you if you want speed then you \ncan um then you can actually well if you \nwant if you want less memory \nrequirements if you have less Ram then \nyou can crank up how much uh how much uh \nyou're compressing and you'll be able to \nstore more vectors so that's the story \nof everything that happened till now \nand one of the problems with the \nprevious implementation was that \nwe realized that there was this \ntrade-off the more you compressed uh the \nthe more uh loss of recall you would \nhave because the the vectors are not \nmore accurate anymore if I tell you that \nSebastian is in this continent it's \nharder for you to locate exactly where \nhe is right and if JP is also in the \nsame continent uh if then you can't \ndifferentiate between them that was the \nmain problem \nso that was the story up until 1.20 if \nyou share your screen if you share my \nscreen now Sebastian I can talk about \nthe modifications that we've made to \nimprove uh improve PQ \nokay so there's a couple of improvements \nthat we've made here the first \nImprovement uh that we've made oh wait \nbefore I talk about the improvements any \nquestions about PQ any any thoughts \nthere guys \nnope okay this sounds good to me so far \nyeah okay so one of the main changes \nthat we made here was well we did some \nuh memory management to make sure that \nyou can query uh compressed vectors \nfaster uh these are details that I'm not \ngonna not gonna cover you can read more \nabout these \num the first thing that I want to get to \nis fit time on large data sets \nso in my explanation I mentioned that \nyou need to have a specific number of \nvectors already in review before you can \nenable PQ because the the average \nrepresentations of vectors are learned \nfrom vectors that you already have in \nleviate so before we recommended that \nyou have ten thousand a hundred thousand \ntwo hundred thousand vectors pre-loaded \nand then you enable PQ to learn the um \nthe the average representations of the \nvectors that you can then compress at \nthose vectors with and new vectors with \num and what we realized was people would \nput in a lot of vectors and then they \nwould enable PQ and their and their V8 \ninstance would go into read-only mode \nfor a really long time \nso now what we've done is we've added \nthis hyper parameter the training limit \nwhich says you can set this limit but it \ndefaults to a hundred thousand meaning \nthat if you have a million or 10 million \nvectors already in vva and you enable PQ \nnot all 10 million will be used to fit \nthe PQ algorithm only a hundred thousand \nwill be used so the the time that you \nhave to have the vva instance in \nread-only mode is only going to be \ncapped by however long it takes to fit \nit on a hundred thousand data points 100 \n000 vectors so this is a a pretty good \nkind of quality of life Improvement \num \nthe the only I guess 100 000 vectors is \nenough to understand the underlying \ndistribution of the vector segments so \nthis is good enough if you want more \nthen you can modify this parameter to a \nmillion and then or a half a million and \nthen it'll use a half a million vectors \nto learn the PQ compression algorithm \nthen others hundred thousand vectors \nlike randomly sample that they like the \nfirst hundred thousand how does that \nwork I believe they're randomly sampled \nbut I would have to talk to some of the \npeople that implemented it to know but \nit would make sense that they're \nrandomly sampled and because we're only \ntrying to understand the underlying \ndistribution of the vectors it makes \nsense to just randomly sample them yeah \n100 \n000 versus a random hundred thousand \nbecause yeah so this is so does this \ngoes back to the question of sampling \nbias let's say you let's say the order \nin which you pass the data in was really \nweird right let's say you're passing in \nimages and you're vectorizing the images \nand for some reason let's say you have a \ngrocery store and the first 100 000 \nobjects are all images of products from \nthe uh vegetable aisle right or the \nfresh produce aisle and the next 100 000 \nare uh our images from the serial aisle \nor the milk aisle now your hundred \nthousand objects are going to be all uh \nfresh produce and so the Learned PQ \nrepresentations are going to be biased \ntowards vegetables \nso it if you take the first hundred \nthousand your your PQ algorithm is going \nto be all off as opposed to if you \nshuffle them and you pass the data in \nand then you randomly sample from that \ndata \num then in that case you'll get maybe I \ndon't know 10 000 vegetable uh vectors \nten thousand milk vectors ten thousand \nserial vectors and in that case you have \na better approximation of what is found \nin in your vector space Oh yeah that \nmakes sense yeah cool cool yeah \nand what what is involving that learning \nis it to figure out which maybe parts of \nlike which dimensions are like the \nbiggest differentiators between \ndifferent vectors so if there's like a \nfew fields that are always like between \n1 and 0 and 98 but there's some others \nthat jump a lot like what's there \nyeah so the main idea behind learning \nthe uh PQ compression it's called a code \nbook because anytime you give me a new \nVector I can I look through the codebook \nto learn what is the vector uh what is \nthe compressed representation of this \nand so the training essentially takes \nthe vector cuts it up into a \npredetermined size and then it says I \ntake all of the first segments of all of \nmy 100 000 vectors here and then I learn \nwhat are some good average \nrepresentations of these so for example \nif if we're on this call and we say I \nwant to learn about I want to represent \npeople not through their XYZ coordinates \nbut the continents that they live in \nright or the countries that they live in \nrather \num if you only have two countries that \nyou can use it'll take the most numerous \ncountry and it will say okay this is a \nlocation for for an average location for \nthis person right \num so that's what you're learning \napproximately okay uh 100 000 works well \nbecause it's uh it's enough to learn the \naverage distribution \num if you and you can also uh \nparameterize over how many \napproximations per segment you want to \nlearn so for example if I say I want to \nlearn the average country of this call \nand you say I only want one country then \nthat average country is going to be \nsomewhere in between all of our \ncountries but now if I say okay you can \nlearn three countries three average \ncountries then we'll get I don't know \nGermany will get Canada and we'll get uh \nsomewhere in Europe \nwhich will be the average of where JP is \nand where Sebastian is so those averages \nare what you what the algorithm is \nretaining now I don't need to know \nexactly where JP is and exactly where \nSebastian is I can just remember the \naverage of where you guys are and every \ntime a new person comes in who's close \nenough to JP or Sebastian I'm going to \nturn their Vector into the average \nVector of where you guys are \nand then so now you only need to \nremember a bunch of averages as opposed \nto exactly the precise coordinate to the \nvectors and that's where all the memory \nsaving happens \ncool yeah I have a question yes how to \nbreak it \nyou can so you can break it if you don't \nuh allow for enough uh \ncentroids so when you fit the algorithm \nit's called the k-means algorithm if you \nset the K means if you set K2 low then \nit will squish all of the vectors down \nto one centroid and it will lose all \ninformation \num so if another answer to that is if \nyou compress too much then all all \nuseful information in the vectors is \nlost it's almost like saying all the \nvectors now project to one data point \nand you can't learn anything from that \ndata point so and that's when whenever \nwhen I made this the decision that I \nwant to to then yeah reduce my storage \nhowever it's possible to go back so is \nit useless or \nuh so yeah that's a good question can \nyou uncompress I \nI'm not sure if you can if you can go \nback Derek maybe is it I know there's a \nway to enable PQ \num \nisn't it why we store the full Vector on \nthe dish yeah this is what I this is \nwhat I was about you don't have to \nuncompress that you have full Vector is \njust not in memory \nyeah this is this goes back to the \nsecond part of the of the rescoring \ncomponent here because the main reason \nin 1.18 why you lost a lot of recall was \nbecause you're now uh ranking and \ncomparing distances that are compressed \num but now because we're storing the uh \nthe exact representations of the vectors \non disk and not in memory we can do this \nrescoring \num whether you can switch back and forth \nI'll have to get back \num maybe there's someone in the chat \nthat can answer this \num I'll have to look into that but I I \nthink you can \num but I want to talk a little bit about \nthis rescoring component which is the \nmain kind of punch line of the release \nHere \nthe main idea behind rescoring is one \nsecond let me I'll talk about it and \nthen I'll show you experiments of before \nand after so now what we do is uh rather \nthan show you the uh rather than show \nyou the uh retrieved vectors uh based on \ndistance calculation so if you pass in a \nquery vector and rather than using the \ncompressed versions of the vectors to \nreturn the closest vectors what we do is \nyou pass in a query Vector we use the \ncompressed representations to learn what \nare the let's say 100 most closest \npotential vectors and then once we know \nthe hundred closest vectors out of the \nmillions of vectors that you have in \nyour vector space what we do is rescore \nthe hundred vectors we go back into disk \nand we say these are the hundred vectors \nthat are the most important \ngive me the uncompressed perfect \nrepresentation of these vectors and you \nrecalculate all the distances between \nthose uncompressed vectors and the query \nvector so now what this enables is if \nyou had distortions in the ranking of \nthose hundred vectors due to PQ \ncompression those are completely \neliminated because now I'm re-scoring \nthem using the original representation \nof the vectors and this we're doing \nexperiments around this where \nbefore \nuh this is what we had in 1.18 where the \nmore you compressed the the more the \nless recall you had the more Distortion \nyou uh introduced into the system and \nthe less likely you were to get the uh \nthe correct Vector back so before you \nwere paying a price uh in terms of \nrecall for your memory uh savings but \nnow because we have this rescoring \ncomponent we're running experiments on \nreal world data sets where \nif you look at this graph for example \nthere's pretty much no difference \nbetween the compressed recall and \nperformance versus the uncompressed \nperformance and this is because when we \nnarrow down on the few vectors that are \nimportant we actually rescore using the \ntheir uncompressed representation which \nmakes sense here the only way that this \nwould the only way that you would lose \nrecall is if due to the Distortion you \nuh you weren't able to obtain the 100 \nbest vectors and so going back to the \nquestion of how could this potentially \nbe broken or what could go wrong if the \nDistortion is so high that the 100 \nvectors you get are not the right ones \nthen retrieving the uh the uncompressed \nversion of them wouldn't help that much \nbut from the experiments that we've done \nso far the uncompressed versus the \ncompressed representation \num is is quite basically you're not \npaying a price anymore for the \ncompression so there's no reason not to \ndo it \num there's examples of this as well I'll \nalso show you another \num a couple of graphs here where we took \nuh five a half a million vectors of the \ndbpedia data set and we vectorize them \nusing the ada002 model so the vectors \nare 1 500 dimensional I believe here and \nagain you can see the compressed and \nuncompressed uh performances there's no \ndifference because of this rescoring \ncomponent which is all important and \ngiving us these results \nwhen we go up to a million vectors you \ncan see that we the the the throughput \nthe query per second here suffers a bit \nin the compressed representation \num we're also running more experiments \nusing the sphere data set so we're \nrunning \num we're compressing and comparing to \nthe uncompressed representation of a \nmillion sphere data points 10 million \nsphere data points so we're we're going \nto put all that together into a Blog and \nthen we're going to release it so that \nif you're planning on using PQ you can \nactually look at how much data points \nyou have what the dimensionality of \nthose data points are and then and then \nwhat the um what the curve before \ncompression and after compression looks \nlike so that you can judge for yourself \nfor your application what you want to \nuse okay \nbut overall this is this is all great \nnews because if if you looked at the \nperformance before there was a material \nprice you were paying for uh the uh the \nlower uh memory but now for the most \npart you don't you don't pay a price so \nit I think the default \num you can you can enable PQ and then if \nyou see that your throughput is is lower \nor you're suffering on recall then for \nyour application you might want to do a \nsimilar analysis to this where you look \nat uncompressed and compressed versions \nto see for your application if it makes \nsense or not \nso so then basically if you've got a \nlarge enough data set where memory might \nmight start to become an issue you know \nthat's when you should be looking at PQ \nright \nyeah exactly so let me give you let me \ngive you a couple more specifics here so \non this graph on the left hand side the \nif you look at memory requirements for \nthis guy \num the uncompressed uh vectors that \ntakes about 5 000 megabytes of memory \nthe compressed Vector takes about 500 \nmegabytes of memory so the uh the orange \nline here is uh 10 the memory \nrequirements the ram requirements of the \nblue line over here and the performance \nis almost identical \num for one tenth the memory price which \nis which is pretty amazing \num on on here the the uncompressed \nversion is so this is a million of the \ndbpedia data set the uncompressed \nversion here \nis uh 18 \nof the sorry the the compressed version \nis 18 memory of the uncompressed version \nso that's pretty impressive because the \nbiggest one of the biggest challenges \nwe've seen like with Vector databases \nwas like uh yeah spending ton of money \non having more and more RAM but now even \nlike large data sets are affordable \nfor pretty much any business right so if \nbefore like you were saying like oh yeah \nlike I have a billion that's going to be \nexpensive now you may have a billion you \ngo like actually that's okay I can do it \nor if you have like even 10 million he's \nlike yeah or maybe you could even run \nthis uh 100 million in your MacBook or \nsomething now and still be able to get a \npretty good results MacBook or whatever \nmachine you're using so I am I'm \nactually absolutely excited about it \nI've actually now I want to run it on my \ncomputer and see how far can I push it \non my just local machine until like the \nwhole thing falls apart \nand the great thing about this is that \nit's all configurable where \num if you don't care about recall as \nmuch you can keep on compressing sure \nyou'll lose recall at a point but you \ncan uh like whatever memory requirements \nyou have you can compress uh to it to a \ncertain degree to fit within those \nrequirements \num if you're not compressing too much \nyou're not paying any price if you're \ncompressing way too much then you have \nto calibrate for what is the price and \nrecall that that you're paying there \nright and and then um where can people \nfind all this good info about PQ and uh \nimprovements in 120. yeah so the the \nblog post is your main go-to outside of \nthat you can go into documentation here \nuh here we think there's links below oh \nis there are there links one second okay \nso if we go here yeah these are the two \nmain pages so if you want to learn more \nabout PQ so on a conceptual level some \nof what we covered here you can read \nthrough this if you want to learn how to \nconfigure PQ \num this is available right here right so \nif you go into the vector index config \nscroll all the way down to PQ \nover here \nthis is I've zoomed in quite a bit here \nbut so you can enable PQ over here and \nthis is the new hyper parameter that I \nwas talking about you can set this uh \nover here it defaults to a hundred \nthousand so you can read all about \nconfiguring as well as the concepts \nbehind this as well and then a small \nplug here we're gonna we're gonna talk \nall about this in a in a new blog post \nthat's coming out soon as well \nnice nice and all those links we also \nhave in the description of the video or \nif this one is not there yet we should \ndefinitely add it after the session \nyeah yeah it's all in that release blog \nso many there's links to all the \ndocumentation Pages within each section \nof the blog so you can follow through \nafter you read about the feature as to \nhow you configure it and and the \nconceptual page to describe what it is \nat high level and so on so yeah \nis there is there like any \nperformance difference in terms of how \nfast the queries are because \nif we don't have to do like the precise \nscanning yeah like you actually you \nactually pay a price in terms of \nthroughput so as you can see here \num if you have a a compressed \nrepresentation you can you can run uh \nless queries per second because of the \nDistortion that the compression uh \ncompression introduces and also because \nof the um the code book lookup every \ntime you have a vector you have to look \nat the the code book so that takes uh \nsome time as well so it adds a little \nbit of latency the compression \nit's almost free but not quite yeah you \ncan also tweak the um the latency so you \ncan play around based on the the \nparameters of PQ you can you can trade \noff memory with uh with your latency as \nwell as recall but if you look at the \nhnsw parameters you can tweak those for \nuh latency versus \nlatency versus uh recall as well right \nso there's a bit of juggling between the \nparameters between QP and then H and SW \ngoing on or maybe you know the savings \nyou make on on RAM like where you know \nspend less money on RAM and then put \nmore powerful CPUs or with more cores \nand maybe you could actually recover \nsome of that performance just purely \nbecause you have more raw power uh to do \nother parts and calculations so it could \nbe that if you look at it just purely \nfrom like Financial point of view you \nmight end up spending similar amount of \nmoney or less and yet get like something \nfaster because you know you move your \nInvestments all around like you know we \ndraw investments from ramp and more into \nthe you know like a CPU land and you're \ndoing well \nportfolio management \nyeah yeah an economist on on the plane \nyou know yeah \nnice \nall right awesome that's all I had to to \ndo with PQ and rescoring folks \nperfect any more questions oh one one \nway to break it will probably be to \nincrease that limit right to 10 million \nback to \nand then that would oh \nyeah that would that would move it into \nread-only for a long long time because \nnow it's going to learn the distribution \nover 10 million vectors \num before before we had this limit if \nyou had put in 10 million vectors in \nthere that's what it was actually due \num yeah so that's I propose we call it \nthe read-only comma \nyeah \nthat would be perfect hey um so the last \nbut not least we have them the demo from \nJP \nso uh JP do you wanna show us your \nknowledge base app yeah sounds good um \nI'll be pretty quick so let's imagine if \nyou can share my screen or at least my \napp of course a high chat map so the \nmotivation for this is that I think \ntwofold right one is that I run these \nwebe workshops every so often and quick \nplug we've got one coming up tomorrow \n4pm Bridge Standard time so if you can \njoin us uh find the link uh maybe on the \ndescriptions but also on our social \nchannels \num and and people like really enjoy \nseeing you know practical examples of \nwhat you can do with weaviate as well as \nlike you know sort of like the simple \nqueries that we show in introductory \nwebinars right so that was one \nmotivation the other is that sometimes I \nget a bit lazy like I recently got a \nPlayStation and one of the things I \nwanted to do was like hey what games do \nI get right and there's like all these \ngreat YouTube videos on like video you \nknow game reviews and whatever else but \nI don't really want to watch 15 minutes \nof videos each time I want to like you \nknow learn about a game or like a \nfeature or something and I thought I \nwould put the two things together and \nbuild this fairly simple app so \num it also so what I wanted to show here \nis just kind of like how it's abstracted \nso here I'm just instantiating the app \nand or what it does at a very high level \nit creates a wavier instance and dumps \nall this text information that I give it \ninto one collection right so I can give \nit YouTube videos I can give it like a \ntext file so this is like some text of \nwhat kubernetes is just from the website \nI can add Wikipedia articles just by \ngiving it the title so these are all \nkind of wrapper functions for doing \nthings like that I can even add YouTube \nvideos just by giving it the URL like so \nso this is the release podcast \num that Connor and Etienne did and then \nI can do things with that content which \nis like really really cool and look I'll \nshow this more in more detail in the \nworkshop but uh writing these wrapper \nfunctions are really really simple so \nthat's why I'll be showing that in the \nworkshop so here I've got a function to \nsummarize a particular entry so what I'm \ndoing is summarizing the YouTube video \nthat I imported above \num I won't go through a lot of details \nof what's Happening under the hood but \nbasically what it does is it gets the \nYouTube video downloads it gets the \ntranscript through open Ai and then \ningest it into uh into this waviate \ndatabase by chunking and the chunking is \nfairly simple too and I can go hey \nwhat's this video about and it says it's \nEtienne talking about wavy at 1.2 and \nyou can learn about all these things \nlike memory usage shots multi-tenancy \nand so on uh so you know again I can get \na high level review or view of this \ncontent without like you know listening \nto it so I can say decide from this \nsummary what I want to do with the video \ngoing forward right \nor I can go or actually maybe not \nlimited to this specific content I can \ngo well based on everything that's in \nthe database what can I learn about if I \ngive it a particular topic so if I go \num and this is a little bit of prompt \nengineering on my part under the hood I \ncan say well maybe I want to learn about \nwaviate but I don't know what kind of \nthings I want to learn about So based on \nthe content that's in the knowledge base \nI might learn about hybrid search \num you know module system blah blah blah \nand in a similar way I can just give it \na particular prompt \nand and do something with the content \num and for example here I imported a \nvideo game review \nand this is just uh it's quite verbose \nthe way it does things the the \nparticular library and I can say oh what \nkind of kind of Gamers might this \nparticular game appeal to and I can ask \nthat to this video content right so \nit'll say this game blah blah blah might \nappeal to people who enjoys action \nadventure games and emphasis on \nstorytelling so it's all you know stuff \nwe've seen before in terms of retrieval \nuh augmented generation right so that's \nfairly standard but \num and and just I wanted to show people \njust how simple it is and how easy it is \nto put these types of apps together \nusing wavy8 \num I have I want to write another \nwrapper function which I haven't done is \nto summarize multiple videos which I \nhaven't done that or multiple bits of \ncontent \num but yeah that's the really high level \nsummary of what I was trying to build \nwith this app and I've got even just a \nfairly simple text search wrapper so I \ncan just search for a particular phrase \nand it gets me you know what I a number \nof chunks right so if I search for the \nphrase multi-tenancy it does a vector \nsearch and I get different chunks back \nright so I get like Source path title \nand so on \nso yeah that's the app um I'll stop \nraving on about it \num it's really inspired by partly by my \nlaziness and and not wanting to watch \nthese kind of like you know YouTube \nvideos or reviews and something that's \npotentially a little bit you know a \nlittle bit long \num but but you know for for demo \npurposes as well because people really \nseem to enjoy \num playing with the generative search \nmodule which is really powerful in terms \nof making your data Dynamic and \ninteracting with it and um I think the \ntopic of chunking seems to come a lot \ntoo right I've got this long piece of \ntext or I've got this video which can't \nbe fit into one object and and to be \nhonest you probably don't want to anyway \nfrom retrieving information from it \num so I wanted to show that as well so \nyeah that's me um and that's that's the \nthat's the app and \num it's not open sourced just yet it's \non GitHub but I haven't I haven't \nreleased it \num but I'll do that as well for people \nto check out in in the near future and \nif you want to see it as a bit of a \npreview come to the workshop tomorrow \nand then you can ask me questions about \nit and then check it out in more detail \nand one question or two questions yeah \num is when you get a transcript from \nopen areas there are also a timestamp \nincluded so it's possible to jump to to \na specific time stamp in the video we'll \ntranscript this \nso I believe you can get time stamps I \nhaven't set that up I've seen other \npeople write apps with timestamps I \nhaven't done it so all I do is to get \nthe whole transcript through whisper and \nchunk that up because \num no sorry I get the YouTube video I \nchunk that up because the whisper API \nhas a limit as to how big the file can \nbe so I kind of make it certain it's \nlike 15 minute segments or something \num get transcripts from there and then \nthey just get chunked based on whatever \nword limit that it has so it's like a \nfairly basic chunking mechanism I've got \nat the moment with a little bit of \noverlaps it's like a sliding window type \ndeal \num and all the bits can be swapped out \nso I'll be building in like other \nchunkers and all that stuff and we \nshould be able to build in timestamps as \nwell because yeah it'll be really good \nto be like oh I want to find out the \npiece a bit of this video where they \ntalk about like the I don't know \ngameplay demos or like uh what where \nthey talk about performance or whatever \nit is or if I want to look at atn's \npodcast and look through the bits where \nhe talks about the hybrid algorithm \nright so something like that \num that'll be really useful for sure \nthat would be super nice to have one \nsingle point of Tools around \ndocumentation so we are filling in our \ndocs to written docs the YouTube videos \nand whatever it is multimodal \ndocumentation or how to use vb8 and then \nyeah having this one single point of \nentry for for people want to learn \ndeviate or try yeah I think that'll be \ncool and that was one of my other \nmotivations was too because I want to \nlearn about you know if I want to learn \nabout containerization and kubernetes \nright I can just dump in all this \ninformation into it and start asking it \nquestions and if I kind of get the \nprompt good enough and kind of careful \nabout looking at the results hopefully \nit doesn't hallucinate too much right in \nterms of generating results from the \nfrom the retrieved text and I think \nthat'll be really cool for sure and I \nhaven't checked out like typing uh sorry \ngetting the language model to produce \ncode but I'm sure you could do similar \nthings if you give it enough like it's \npossible but then yeah but um I was part \nof several projects doing this because \none of the hackathon projects did this \nand also um one of the problems is that \nthen the dependencies so the model is \nhallucinating the dependency or the \nversions of the program so one of the \ntricks is then to build the chain you're \nhanding in the error error you're \ngetting and then yeah doing the next \niteration yeah \nso yeah the the detail around that gets \ngets quite tricky for sure \nI think the tricky part is with like \nmaybe like false positive like what if \nwe give somebody call a piece of code \nthat is just not a good advice or not a \ngood you know piece of code and then \nthey kind of maybe learn the wrong way \nor they just go like oh this is all \nbroken right and I think we've all seen \nit way too often \num but yeah I I think this would be cool \nbecause we could combine many of the \nthings we talked about today because if \nwe use uh the multi-model models we then \nwe can search across all of those \ndifferent results then include Auto cut \nto kind of exclude maybe some of the \npoorer results right and then throw in \nsome uh you know PQ and then like reduce \nthe amount of memory and maybe you could \nrun the vector search on all of the Wii \ndocumentation videos directly on your \nmachine right you don't even have to \nhave it in the cloud or somewhere right \nand uh I wonder if you if we could even \nshrink it so much that we could put it \non a mobile phone right and then I could \ntake it you know offline you know take \nit on the plane and stuff like that \nthat'll be pretty awesome for sure yeah \nlet's go guys love it \num so we have like some uh good uh nice \nwarm words from our audience so Brent uh \nsays he liked your presentation JP \num so thank you Brent uh we're really \nhappy to have you here uh Felix also \nenjoyed today's sessions and uh so he he \nliked our presentations and uh of course \nuh we didn't forget about codigo \num I'm not sure if that's actually your \nname or maybe this is just like a in a \ndifferent language like a coder in go \nmaybe I don't know I'm gonna claim \nignorance right now but uh but but but \nalso the avatars is let's go so it could \nbe yeah but it could be like you know \nSebastian go like I don't know if codigo \nis a is a formal name or maybe now it is \nright uh and anything else \nI was gonna say if your name is codigo \nyou probably have to pick up Gora like \nyou can't be like Oh I'm a Dev my name \nis \nI don't write go it just wouldn't work \nright I know right like so um you can \nset your set up your your kids for \nsuccess or failure depending on what \nframework \nforeign \nyeah like uh yeah I have a cousin his \nname is as400 he's not doing well \nanymore \nthis is great this is great \num I think that's it I think this this \nwas an amazing session \num thank you all for uh for joining \nthank you for for the audience just like \nuh one final uh reminder so thank you \nfor watching thank you for listening and \nthen remember to subscribe uh because \nthis way you uh you get a notification \nfrom YouTube whenever we do cool stuff \num and if you have any questions even \nafter this you know what to find us just \ncome to um the wibit community uh \ndefinitely find us there we are there \nwe're pretty active and then we are \nworking on all sort of things but also \nif you build something really cool and \nmaybe you would want to join one of \nthose sessions \num we're always open to having cool \nguests \num or if you have idea on a topic right \nlike hey I'd like to see more of this or \nthat \num I'm pretty sure we'll do something \nabout the long chain the next time you \ncome around because we've heard that \nthis is a popular topic but maybe \nthere's some other topics you are all \ninterested so but yeah thank you for \nwatching us and until the next time \num and yeah have a great day \nhi everybody \nbye bye \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Air Episode 10", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5cQ9VjBoAU", "timestamp": "", "reader": "JSON",
