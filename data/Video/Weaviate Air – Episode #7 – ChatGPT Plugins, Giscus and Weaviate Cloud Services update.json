{"text": "Planned topics: * ChatGPT Plugins and Weaviate * What is new in Weaviate Cloud Services * Giscus \u2013 feedback/discussions ... \nforeign[Music]this is episode 7 so uh it's a luckyseven lucky for you because we have aspecial guest in the studio with us it'sa in a studio well it's like well in theair somewhere we have Veronica from themovie cloud services team which isamazing and the usual suspect from thedevil team Dan Erica and Zen so uh helloeveryone and I also brought in just fortoday's call these two guys so these aremy meerkats the skinny guy is also ameerkat by the way it was a gift thatdown brought from South Africa which iskind of cool so it's a really reallycool so thank you for watching thank youfor listening uh we really reallyappreciate your time that you spend withus so so it's really really goodum if you want to help this this channeluh give the video a like whether youwatch it live or later on you know liketime is is an interesting concept rightlike this is happening live and yet youwill be able to watch it years from nowwhich is really coolum and then the best thing aboutactually being live is the ability toask questions so please feel free to askquestions as we go I'll try to monitorthe questions sometimes people answerthem like uh directly on the YouTubechannel uh but but we'll also try toaddress them and then I'll share themwith everybody elseso that's it about like the the usual uhintro and then we have four topics thatwe would like to cover today so thefirst topic that we will talk about isdiscuss or actually how can you shareyour feedback with us directly on theVBA website which is really cool so Danwill talk to you about thatum the next thing that we have andthat's why we have Veronica here iswhat's new in the Vivid cloud serviceslike you maybe you'll get some secretsfrom one of the engineers that wasbuilding it so this is really cool nopressure Vera is going to be great forsureum there's also a lot of thingshappening oh this is a new graphic thatwe have uh a lot of things happeningaround like the charge EPT retrievalplugins and then there is our plugins ingeneral so then we'll talk to you aboutthe the plugin that works with vv8 I'msure he'll be able to explain it waybetter than I do uh and then finallylast but not leastthere's been so much excitement aroundAuto GPT and then actually you can useAuto GPT with Vivid and Erica is goingto cover that for us and of course weall have a nice chat about it and thenhave some questions so feel free to dropquestions and also as a second thingslike just drop us a message just forwarm up say hey where are you watchingfrom you know like or like is this thefirst episode that you're watching I isthis like a second or a third Heck ifyou saw all seven I'll send you at-shirt like you can lie I will not havea way to to test but the first person tosay maybe you'll get a t-shirt you knowand um Erica yeah you know the firstcomment yeah thanks for joining uh youalready have a t-shirt so that would becheating but um maybe I'll send you onespecial I pretended all seven so youattended all seven right like you're areal Proum so really really great so that's itfor the warm up let's dive intoum discuss so done what can you tell usabout it because like you worked on itum and uh it's actually pretty coolproject and um I feel like people reallyenjoy learning about ityes hi everyoneum so viscous is a commenting widget andthe motivation was to give developers aneasy way to interact with ourdocumentation to give us a thumbs up orsome feedback or else qualificationquestions and so far the way you do thatyou'd have to go to GitHub find ourproject not find an issue but let's sayyou read the blog post and I have aquestion about Auto GPT you can simplytype it in thiscomment widget down here you don't haveto go to GitHub you don't have to findthe correct product it's right thereso um these comments pertain to the blogor to our documentation for instancelet's sayyou want to check out the new embeddedleviate feature that we launchedrecently and do I read a documentationyou realize that we don't talk aboutmodulesso you can leave a comment somethinglike what modules are enabled by defaultand I log into GitHub so I see thiscomment button if you are commenting forthe first time you're going to see abutton to sign in with GitHub once youauthorize that your comment will postand uh comments end up in the ev8 Io Iorepo in the discussion taband I've refreshed the page and you seeit here there was a document onpageand um everything is done through GitHubso your identity will be preserved thereyou can see this was my username andthis is a comment I leftand if you simply want to express yourappreciation for the fantastic job thatwe've been doing on this you can alsogive us a heart or even say that thepage rocksand that will also be reflected righthere onand the GitHub discussionso the way we built this was initiallywe looked atum popular commenting widgets one ofthem was discussthey all love this sport mantle betweendiscussion and somethingum but this hasthis class was not open source and uh italso tracks users so we looked at opensource options and foundthis cast which is umproject that is building a common systempowered by GitHub discussionswhat we saw earlierso umthis has advantage that it's all opensource and it's stored on GitHub alongwith uh our code and the issues you canlink to each numbers and you can createa new shot of a discussion so we aregoing to do that when we triage commentsand it's easy to export anything if weever want to move to a different systemin the future thanks to the GitHub apisand it's a really useful discussionsystem that you may be interested inadopting for your own open sourceprojectpretty easy to get started with we madea few customization to have um both thename here and the path because sometimesthe name can be ambiguous likeinstallation but the path is ambiguatedbut essentially it was a pretty storyfor integrationso yeah we welcome your comments on bothblog posts or the documentation justscroll to the bottom andgive us some nice emojis or someconstructive feedbackexcellent excellentum I mean it's always like I love likewhen you're like yeah give us feedbackbut not just feedback make itconstructive right like uh be nice aboutit like even if something is uh you knowneeds a bit of change and help like uhbe constructive but I'll definitelyencourage everyone else to kind of likecheck it outum and and also I know and I think Danis about to show it for every blog postthat we have uh we also have discussionsat the bottom so if you read one of theblog posts or all of them like uh likeyou shouldum and you find it interesting or youhave like some question follow follow-upquestions uh that could be a pretty coolplace to do that and the latest blog wasalready got some likes Etc so that'sreally really cool to uh actually Ilet's see who these people wereyeah John yeah so like yeah let's let'sget some emojis and uh from from thecommunity like is uh right now there's15 people I can see watching so uh whynot right I'm curiousum and maybe I can stop sharing yourscreen for nowum how long did you take to implementthat like what was like um from themoment you knew it's going to be discusslike how long did you take for thatum in terms of absolute hoursI don't know something like four I wouldsay but it was much more difficult to dothe market research for this and umsee what implications discuss has versusdiscussso I would say four plus a few more fortesting and debugging and um there are afew points that don't work that well ifyou only leave an emoji we still saydocumentation comment on that pagethere's actually there's no comment toadjust the Emojis so I I've been tryingto tweak that but I don't have a goodsolution so farwe might have in the future somethinglike reactions on the post as opposed tocomments on itnice nice but this is the thing rightlike if uh people in the audience seethis and like we've already done theresearch and if you like what what youhave like uh yeah you could you couldget it done in like half a day maybe aday that's pretty impressive time yeahthat it takes to integrate this theoffers we did an internal testing and sohow we graduated and all that butum now that you know it's uhit's a good widget to adopt you can doit much faster than we didexcellent I think I think for me whatthis improves a lot is the workflow onfeedback for uh blogs and documentationso after I wrote that um chat TPT pluginblog I got emails Twitter responsespeople reached out on the slack channelso there's likea thousand different channels that youcan ask questions but the most relevantone now would just be discus because Iwould be following that and we can havea conversation there you can of courseemail me and reach out to me throughwhatever Channel but this would be Iwould be watching out for questionsthere so my response rate would be veryhigh on giskus so now we have like oneCentral channel for questions feedbackeverything related to a blog postyou uh people in the comments rightso you can do that if I want to sharethe screen I cannot show how that worksif you know that on GitHub but umso in here you are in GitHub discussionsand you can say Sebastian please answerthisumbutin here there's no Auto completionand that's the last limitation of theplugin so to expand a bit more on theimplementation uh this is uh the webcomponent and then there is a gizkasor reactcomponent that we usedand that made it easier to implementoncewe found out about itand the bulk of the work so I didn'tinclude this in the four hours the bookwas to actually go through each page ofour site and make sure the footer had areference to this widget because we havedifferent types of blog posts anddifferent Footers some of them arecalled to action hey us vv8 others arestay in touch depends on the context soumis not impossible that most of the workwould be actually to just place thewidget in your footer if that's not auniform piece of contentnice nicecool no question so now it's a shout outtime so you know at the beginning Iasked our audience like where people arewatching uh from and uh so we have Brentfrom CanadaOttawa so uh Zen maybe not not too faroff although Canada is so huge that'sprobably far far enoughum then you have deep we have deep fromLondon uh we have Sila from Netherlandsuh then you already hand waving and thenwe have virenda from in Indiana USA andthen we have Marco from Milan so uhwelcome everyone to Vivid air we aresuper happy to have you here and uhhopefully just this shout out alone wasenough hey and we have someone fromLisbon Portugal ottmanum FYI Portugal is my one of my favoritecountries in Europe uh so likedefinitely uh excited to see somebodyfrom Lisbon and uh any excuse to gothere by the way it's it's a good thingfor me so maybe I should go and meetottman that would be coolumI'm trying to hide the banner but it'snot hiding maybe he's just not showingfor me there we go as a delay all rightso perfect so that'suh now we have Veronica that will talkto us about WCS Vera should I share yourscreen yes pleaseall right so all rightso I'm already logged in this is our newWCS we launched it around three weeksagoso what I prepared for you today is thesandbox which is the free sandbox it's afree clusterand you you have 14 days to use thatand you can see here some details likeURL the Vivid versioninformation about API keys andexpiration date etc etcthe next two are about their paidclusters with the standard plan so onewhich I prepared for you is the one withthe lower wee bit version about that ina second or maybe we will go through itright now because we need couple ofminutesto wait for the update so hereumlet's say that we get deployed cool newfeatures and I really really would liketo use themso we prepared the solution that is justone click now and you have to providethe cluster nameand thus click confirm what is happeningnow we have heard here the notificationthat it's starting and here you go youcannot delete the cluster because it'sin a progression State on or query itbecause this is the version without thehigh availability and after a couple ofminutes you will see that the Vividversion is thenewest one and while we are talkingabout that the newest version is 118.3and it enables some cool features forour users about that in a secondum hey Vera this is amazing this this isactually amazing because like sometimesuh like especially when we have like anew release of weaviate right and uh Ialways kind of go like uh yeah like butI really want to straight up like startusing this and then sometimes in thepast I'll just go like hey I'll create anew version and then migrate my dataover but now I can just click the buttonwait for a few minutes and then I canstart using whatever is latest andgreatest so this is amazing I don't knowwe could do thatexactly just like that one click and theother so the magic is happeningunderneath we are already 50 so that'swhy we are slowly move to the next Topicin the meantime which is the eight likeis managementso lots of users they wereum they requestingthat it would be really great if we havesome API keys to have access to thecluster of course this is a great ideabecausebased on this example for for example Ican tell you that this is the sandbox sothe free cluster and I during thecreation so let's go maybe just tocreate a cluster so I picked a freesandbox and this is the uh theauthentication is enabled by defaultwhich is always great to have oneumso let's go back because I wanted justto show you that we have such optionoh and we have to take a pause becauselike you can see the Vivid versionupdate is already done it was quickerthan I thought so that's that's nice wowthat was so easy yeah it's so easy andand fast I I thought that I have moretimeso we have already here the newestversion and uh we can just use ourcluster and query it and fit with withnew cool data so once we go to thesandbox which is the API Keys managementwe can see that I enabled theauthentication during the when I wasclicking on the form and by clicking ona key I see oh okay I can see I have myAPI keys I have the admin okay I can seethe example header which I can copy anduse that for example I would like toshare my cluster with with Joe Sebastianand but I don't want to give you mycredentials to WCS so now you can querythe the cluster because I will sharewith you the URL of the cluster and theAPI key and we will go there in twominutes because there is more about APIkeys so now we released a couple of daysago the the new cool feature which isthe managed API Keys it means you canadd or remove existing Keys it's alsoreally easy so let's go and add a newAPI key could be read only so on theaccess to read the data or full adminaccess we can go maybe with them withonly one generateand we can see that the process startedit's already in progress it takes coupleof minutesand while talking about that let's go tothe another cluster and maybe just toremove some keys becauseI don't want to use this key anymorebecause I think that this is not inusage and it's better to have alwaysonly the the keys we are usingand that's it it's already removed andto for those two clusters action is inprogress of course it takes a couple ofminutes againbut you can do it you know on your ownyou don't have to ask anyone you don'thave to find anything this is just aclick and it's easy and I think it'sreally fast and will be helpful for ourusers oh we have 50 already all rightniceyeah hey so I have a question or in acomment right so first of all I thinkyou'll be one of the first people thatwould want uh ability to delete the keysbecause like right now like let's sayyou compromise your clusters because youshare the cloud the keys with the worldexactly like they're all 700 people thatare watching us live that's a realnumber uh I'm not going to be copyingtrying to hacking into our environmentand that's kind of uh really usefulright because yes by mistake youcommitted your key to GitHub repo or youshowed it on a super popular Vivid airuh you could just delete it and thenlike nobody can get access to itum but I also really love the ability tosplit the read and write keys becauselet's say if for backend operations youhave the right key for uh mod formodifying the data Etc but if you wantto build a website then later on thatuses WIBI to search you should only everuse read key right yes so that's reallyreally cool yeah I'm very excited aboutish and uh I already used the keysbefore but I didn't know that you couldactually change the keys and generatenew ones that's really coolyeah that's our the newest feature solet's see what we've got here so yeah wehave one more key uh already added toour cluster and here I was removing oneright so I don't know if it's yeah Iremoved one of the read-only keys andit's removed but the operation is notfinished yet but no problem it will bedone a couple of minutes uh of course Iwill remove all data I prefer for youguys today this is of course the thething I don't want to pay for all ofthose clustersI mean waves cheap you know yeah I knowI know rightum very good price all rightso one more thing maybe let's um becauseI know that we have lots of users thatthey have already clusters which aredeployed not by us but they aresomewhere in a cool place soyou can add this cluster here inexternal clusters sectionand just query it in the query module soas a testlet'stype dataexcept for example cluster and I haveprepared of course something for youso the URL save and doing that we can goto the query module and as a locked inuser I can see all clusters so themanage clusters and the sandboxesand I can easily query them so this isthe one I prepared with with dataexactly yeah okay so the query cannot beempty of course so let's go there andsee what we have there are some for surepretty basic example but I would like toshow you that that it's working and soI'm a login custom user here so we cansee that yeah okay I can access the dataeverything is fine but in a case we werediscussing beforeso what in the case that I would like tosomeone would like to see the data butnot change the data of course and Idon't want to share my credentials toWCS so let's just log out and we can seethe start screenso let's go there and use the samecluster we were querying nowso I'm pretending I'm the differentperson the new team member so I have toface the cluster URL andSebastianof course nameor one clusterand click connect we are in awe are in a query module so here in thebeginning we didn't support text and acluster querying but now we are so wehave two options because you can belogged in and just class query yourcluster or you can do the thing we werediscussing before so now we can see weare unauthorized right because I'mlogged out and I didn't use theauthorization header so now let's go andjust add it and this is the same clusterI was using when I was logged inso we need the key organizationnow let'spaste the read-only key API keywhich is like that click again and likeyou can see again I have a I have anaccess to the cluster and I can querythis is so amazing um Erica was actuallyclapping she was so excited this is soawesomewowso that would be it from my side what Iwanted to show you today and thank youperfect this is a great uh presentationanybody else have questions before I asksome moremaybe from the audience as well butthey're in here I don't have a questionbut I was talking to um so there was asomeone new to Evie who was interestedin this and all I did was send them alink to WCS and the next email I hadwith them was how do I upload documentsto my webia cluster like the wholeprocess is so seamless andstraightforward that I didn't havemultiple interactions oh this is notworking how do I do this it wasliterally send them a link and then theywant to see how I can how they canupload documents to it from that pointon so this is greatnice nice and we have a nice commentfrom Brent thank you Brentum yeahVera if you are on the free tier can youalso update your instance even though Imean I guesslike if you're creating a cluster aroundthe same time that there's a releaseno noum for now we don't have a feature forsandbox to be updated uh but when thereis a plan to have one we'll have one butas I know now there is no uh plans forthat and sandboxes are now only validfor 14 days so maybe maybe that's that'sthe reason as well so yeah thereshouldn't be too many version changesright in those 14 daysmight have a different idea but yeahsure umand then also since our ctOS here he'sdropped the commentum like yeah it's actually he's so rightjust a few months ago it was a bunch ofmock-ups like we had like the old WCSbut the new one it's so great to seethen and I agree with it at the endamazing demo Vera I know you are a bitnervous before but like hey yeah yeah noreasons to be nervous whatsoever you didgreatum thank you questions anyone elsesorry Dan you goI had another question about the freetier like Americaum the uh API key that's only availablefor those it's not available for thefree tier rightyes it is there is one one key availableI think this is the admin one but wecannot wait we cannot change it or youknow delete or add a new one for now forthe free cluster let's just take a lookyeah you you have just the one defaultone during the creation process rightthere's no read only here okay thereyeswow you should upgrade anybody who wantsa read only keyif there is a needs the rule we readonly read on Nikkianother ways like share your feedbackwith us right and tell us so that woulddefinitely definitely workum just before you I give you the floorto Erica we have another comment veryimpressive from Brad's thanks Bradthank you keep the comments uh comingeveryone that's greatalso there will be a tutorial and blogposts on authorization soum Vera touched on it um and she showedall the corner capabilities but nextweek we'll be releasing something thatcan also help further help the communityusersyeah and about that maybe you canalreadyum say that the future about theupdating cluster is pretty neat becausewith the version1183 you can use the open AIumAPI key in the query module so becausewe wait accepts that so I think thatit's really great information for ourusersI have another question from thecommunity but I'm not sure if that'slike a for us to handle maybe somethingI mean does anyone know here or maybesomething at the end could help with dowe know is there a plan to downloadmodels like with the self-hosted dockerorokay it's for instance to get clipthe only thing that's part of what weare supposed to do with WCS rightyeahyeah maybe we should go pray to themighty Etienne who's watching thesession maybe respond on the commentsbecause I don't think any of us know theanswer to thatum rightquestion from Brad is the cloud servicerunning on AWSall right so our service is running onGoogle Cloud but if we are talking aboutclusters it's coming soon so you candeploy then your clusterin the WCS or or in a AWS I'm sorry orGoogle cloud or maybe in the future forsure in the future Azure cloud and basedon that there will be more and moreconfiguration that it's that the usergets really the you know the the clusterif he or she needsperfect and I also know like in betweenlike a self-hosted and like using WCS weare we also have like uh the hybridmodel so if you have like your own likea set of private VPN or other clustersand then you won't reviate uh likeconnect with Vivid cloud services we canoffer that so we can help help withestablishing it and then do the wholelike hosting uh within your ownenvironment so that's like also like itcould be very useful for like governmentorganizations maybe where you go likehey this has to exist on our uh cloudsuh and then you can't go anywhere elseso that's definitely an optionyeah and uh to your uh response thiscloud service will be an easy sell forme nowwe are glad we converted you Brad thankyouperfect any final comments before wemove on to Zenall right no comments so thank you Veraand there may be some questions later wecould always come back to you uh but nowuh let's uh talk business with Zenthen what do you have for usyeah so maybe I can so I'll show this alittle bit later but what I wanted totalk about was the uh chat GPT retrievalpluginum and so people are going crazy aboutchat GPT and how you can get it to wellhow you can get it to do things that itcan't do properly right now so one ofthe uh issues is that it doesn't handlemathematical problems well first of allbecause it's language and it doesn'tunderstandum math appropriately so with therelease of plugins you could give it amath mode so like Wolfram Alpha could bethe math mode for chat GPT and that'senabled through a pluginto to Wolfram Alphaum and then we wrote a blog post aroundthis that uh that will post in the um inthe uh in the description but this iswhat the blog post was uh I wanted tocover one particular plugin uh which isthe one that we developed for uh forchat GPT and essentially how this pluginworks is quite similar to our generativesearch functionalityum except now what happens is let's sayyou have we V8 and you've got a bunch ofyour own documents these can be anythingfrom your own textbooks if you're astudent you want to conduct search overyour textbooks and you want chat cpg toanswer questions with respect to thosetextbooks or it can be your own likepersonal company document it can be yourentire Enterprise your policy your HRdocumentsyou can put them into Eva andessentially how the retrieval plug-in uhworks for chat GPT is you would just goto chat CPT as regular to their websiteyou would enable the plugin and then yousend you submit a prompt to chat TPT andusually what would happen is if you aska question aboutum what days do I get off or how many uhhow many work from home days do I getchat CPT would say I have no uhinformation about your particularscenario rightum but now what it does instead is itrealizes that I have a connected Vectordatabase so I have this sort of memoryor this uh store of relevant informationthat I should go look at before I tellyou I don't have any information so it'sa way to in the short term augment thememory of a a large language model withanything that you find relevant enoughto put into the vector databaseso basically what it will do is beforeit tells you yeah I don't know if yougive it a very specific prompt it'llquery the vector database and then thevector database comes back with arelevant document so it conducts thesearch and it sends the document toChachi PT and then it reads through itand if it finds an answer to your promptit'll it'll send you a customizedresponse and so this is super coolbecause nowsimilar to the generative searchfunctionality you can just go into chatGPT well not now but when you haveaccess to this so right now this is analpha very few limited people haveaccess to this but when you do getaccess to it eventually you can go tochatgpt and I can actually show thatcomponent of thisso hereyou could go here and then you won'thave access to this right now so it's inAlpha but you could go down here andthen you would be able to see the uh V8retrieval plug-in here you could simplyinstall it so these are the only fewthat are kind of officially accepted atthis pointbut we're in the process of goingthrough this as well so you wouldinstall it and then now you could ask aquestion and then it would work on youruh your own uh document I can show avideo of this actually as well over hereso this is a video that Sebastianrecorded where herehe's going inyeah so that's what the retrieval pluginlooks likeand so this is a question that only thevector database has information aboutchat tpd doesn't know about so you cansee that it uses the retrieval plug-inhere and then you can ask it furtherquestionsthe interesting thing here that I wantto point out let me Zoom back up for asecond notice what it does hereokay so you ask it a questionand thenit uses the plugin and then it uses theplugin again that's an interesting thingthat I want to talk about a little bitlater on but I'll let this whole thingcomplete outyou can have a follow-up conversationwith itso when we created this video uh chatGPT could query leviate to getinformation that it thought was relevantto answering a questionsothewhat what we have now which is version2. version 2 is that you can actually goand insert documents through a querythrough writing a prompt and then alsodelete documents through writing aprompt so in this blog post I mentionedthat this would be super cool becauseyou could tell chat TPT something andyou could ask it to remember it for nexttime or put a store into its Vectordatabase memoryand instead of calling the queryendpoint as is shown here it would justcall the upsert endpoint and it wouldactually insert objects into Eva you canalso call the delete endpoint by tellingit to forget something forget aparticular document or forget that youtold it a particular detail and thatwould call the delete endpoint and itwould remove objects from leviate soit's ayou're basically upserting queryingdeleting things just by talking to chatGPT which is which is pretty scary butit's also super cool as wellthat's really cool for the example thatyou gave of like company policydocuments it's like what if it changesyeah and you kind of need to update thatand that's cool that we could just dothat Withinyeah you don't even have to go toalleviate to do that you don't have tolike call at a particular endpoint youcan ask chatgpt to call the endpoint foryouum digging further into that questionthe super interesting thing with chatGPT and plugins is that you would thinkthat they you have you tell it how tocall the query endpoint or how to querythe vector databasebut that's not actually true when you uhwhen you create the plugin which ifanybody's interested you can actuallysee the code for the weeviate retrievalplugin over herebut when you create the uh the pluginyou have to create a manifest and inthat manifest you have to tell uh chatGPT what the endpoints you're exposingare and you have to describe them so forour endpoints we have the query endpointwhich has a description of retrieveobjects from your alleviate Vectordatabase there's an absurd deletethere's all sorts of endpoints there wejust describe them uh we never actuallytell chat epd the syntax with which touse those endpoints so it doesn't reallyknow how to query but it uses your codeand your description of the code so yourcomments to understand how it shouldquery V8 and how I realized this was soif I go back to this videoyou see hereyou see how it tried it first and itdidn't work this is because it'slearning how to query the database inreal time so it failed the first timeand then it realized okay let me try adifferent way and then it realized howto query the database and then from thatpoint on every time you query so now ifyou ask it another question and if I letit run you see how it works on the firsttry it's because it it made a mistake itlearned how to query it and then everytime from that point on it just uses thesame syntax to query so that's somethingsuper cool that is not apparent in theuh in the kind of the face of the blogor the video itselfum but you you can actually communicateit how to use your plugin and it willuse it accordingly which I thought waswas super interestingyeah and if you if you jump straight tothe end because that'll be a Shamelessplug by the way uh if you go like wayway to the end like you could probablyjust uh jump thereum until we we have the like the finalanswer so yeah post here so FYI thisthis actually is factually correct weare looking for developer Advocates uhto to join with it so uh this is notmade up like this is one of the roleswe're hiring so anyone that would liketo join that you know this thing hereum hey we're looking for people soalways always coolum I also thought like of this and bythe way like uh one uh thing like anon-excite big excuse but uh normallywould show you this life uh the thingwill happen is we like to leavedangerously so we're updating the pluginand then sort of broke it a little bitso that's why we're not showing it livelive because basically right now if youask questions uh charge if you just likeuh gives us an error because we brokethe the current version of the testplugin yeah but that's okay there's agood reason actually because I mentionedhere uh before in version 1.0 we onlyhave the query endpoint that was exposedto chat TPT now we have delete andum and insert or the upstairs endpointso you can add it you can get it toremember and forget things so um we'llhave a blog post on that coming out soonso yeah look forward to thatand we have a question a couple ofquestions so does charge GPD store datafrom your documents via the pluginuh by by store data do you mean updatethe yeah so let me interpret this I'massuming here you mean it can store newinformation into the vector database viathe plugin and the answer is yes so theend point here instead of using query itwould use a separate endpoint called theupsert endpoint and you would tell itlet's say that you've told it that uhyou work for Wi-Fi and vva is lookingfor a developer Advocate role if youwant to tell it the developer Advocaterole is based out of San Francisco orbased out of Silicon Valley rememberthis for me it will actually absurd itinto alleviate for you that's the supercool thing with version two that werethat we're working on right nowyeah but but also by the way like as yousee on um like on the diagram there's avv8 instance itself you also also thisis a vivid instance like that with allthe functionality that you would expectso usually the process will be like heyif you have 10 000 documents that youwant to drop in you'd use the usual wayright like just just insert the datainto vv8 and then chart GPT will be ableto query the database to get its answersright but I think this addition is alsogoing like hey not only can I do it byAPI uh like Zen was explained like youcould do it through uh yeah tellingchart GPT out this objectum so cool I think we all need accessnowwell well here's the fun part and thenwe are planning so there is thisconference odsc East which is in Bostonuh I think it's like 9 to 11 of May andthere's going to be a hackathon thatwill be working with charging PD pluginsand weaviate and uh I think the idea isto have like 10 teams in thereum and then the the every team will getaccess to the chargerpd plugins so umyou know that could be one way to getaccess like LED accessum maybe I can share the link to thehackathon a bit laterum we have another question uh so fromBrent so the Manifest addresses thecontent of allowing editing deleting ofcertain classesyeah so you right now you would have tospecify where to add let's say you havemultiple classes you would have tospecify which class to add it intoum and so the Manifest has thatparticular syntax but in your in yourtalk with chai TPT you would have tospecify those details as wellnice nice and uh we get someencouragement now so like uh hey we allbreak code half the timeum that is so true that is so trueum although when I was younger and now Ithought I was like I'm such a greatengineer like I never write tests I justwrite good code I'm such a likeI was so full of I don't want to saywhatbut yes we've all done that many timesin our lives so it's cool and thenanother word of a question from manamiuh please continue open source effortyou're doing the entire world of favorum that's so nice thank you Monamicoolany more questions ideasoh one more thing I guess umso a lot of people were super interestedin plugins so right now we're looking athow um kind of showing you the storyunderneath how we created this pluginand the reason why we want to do that isso that because the process is quiteGeneral if you wanted to create aplug-in once you did get access youwould go through similar steps you wouldjust have different endpoints and youwould describe to chat GPT how to usethose endpoints so if you had let's saya a Pizza Hut endpoint and you wanted toorder from Pizza Hut specifically youwould describe the endpoints differentlyand everything else would be quitesimilar so you could you could uh youknow create your own endpoint and youcan tell that I'm hungryfrom my exampleI can always tell when you're hungrythat's fine I don't I don't I don't needAI for itum cool and then I have one morequestion from FShow can I add documents as charge GPTuser to the databaseyeah so you would at first there's uhtwo ways you could just hook up to yourweeviate instance and as Sebastian saysuh upload the documentsum as as you would regularly so thatwould be in not through chat GPT so youwould just insert documents here so thatyour instance knew about them the secondway is uh you could tell chat CPT toupsert a document or to remember adocument and it would call the upsertendpoint so this is version 1.0 in theflow chart but in version 2.0 there willbe another endpoint that it can call andit can insert documents one at a timefor youum so the difference there would be likeSebastian said if you're inserting tenthousand a hundred thousand a millionobjects you wouldn't tell chat CPD toinsert it one by one you would actuallyhave to go through Eva and then batchthem and loop through it and uh insertit that would be much more efficient butif you're having a chat with chat GPTand you you say here's a new detailinsert it that would be a much moreeasier way to upsert through touchingyeah I think the upsetting throughcharge GPT to where I could see is likelet's say uh like we showed this examplethat the the company policies and theroles and then like yes see our uhpeople and culture person she could allhey the policy now changed now we haveadditional benefits so she could kind ofgo like HR GPD now the benefits for thecompanies are blah blah blah and then Ithink that could be like a really gooduse case but yeah in general like yeahthere'll be a lot of copy pasting if youwant to use the main chart GPD as likethe way to insert uh not to sayexpensive because also I think thatevery interaction there's some sort ofclicks and tokens that are involved soum for efficiency I would say like oflike uploading loads of documents justgo straight to vb8um we'll like the database is soefficient at it and really good at itlike that's probably the best way inperfect this is this is great I love Ilove the conversation and everythinglike Vera what do you think excitingstuffwould you use thatyes lots of new knowledge for me in thatarea So the plan is that probably I willstart you know using it or learning moreabout thatnice nice yeah it's always cool to comeand learn here so I'm so happy you'rehere that's so coolOkay solike I mentioned earlierum Erica's already getting excited sotell us what do you have for us Ericaall right I'll be covering Auto GPT andhow you can use with bb8 if you wouldn'tmind sharing my screen I don't mind atallSo Yesterday JP and I released a blogpost on auto TPT and how you can use itwith vv8um I want to touch on this image here Ireally love how it's I guess I shouldfirst explain what Auto gbt is um sowhat it does is it leverages gpt4 and3.5 to chain together different thoughtsand complete tasks autonomouslyum so in this figure I don't know if youcan see my mouse yeah um we have threepeople and they look like they're kindof like debating something right andthen they have like these differentworkflows so that's kind of what AutoGPT is it's like you give it a task andnow it's going to kind of createsubtasks in order to complete thatobjective and it kind of just like Workswithin itself to do this um which isvery coolum so what makes this different fromum chat gbt is that with Chachi BT youhave to prompt it right so you arequeering or chatting with chat should beT like one by one and then you'rerefining the prompts so promptengineering is a thing that has emergedfrom thisum but with auto gbt like I said youjust give it a task like order me pizzaand it's like okay I need to find likelocal pizza stores nearbyum figure out like what I've ordered inthe past to see if I like cheese orpepperoni and then it's going to I guessit has a knowledge of my address andit's going to please do it anddeliberateumso it's a really cool thing also I wantto point out that it has gotten a lot ofattention I mean I'm sure I'm likepreaching to the choir but it jumpedfrom 20 000 to 80 000 stars in a matterof days and I we broke this Monday andreleased it yesterday and right now itis at 90. three where do I say righthere 93 almost 94 000. so it's growingquickly oh my God and thank youand you can see it uh jumping up like aninsane amount anyway so that's a littlebit about what it is and how it differsfrom uhand then the capabilities I included afew examples um from Twitterum so Sully shared a thread on using itto conduct market research I guess wecould just show itum so here it has it's defining thesedifferent goals and then it kind of isgoing through the steps in order to dothis then we have baroonum pointed out that um Auto gbt wastasked with creating an application andthen it realized thatsorry wrong one it realized that hedidn't have a he didn't have nodeinstalled on Ninja's computer so Autogbt took it upon itself to find a stackOverflow link and it installed node byitself which is kind of creepyum that it can do all of these taskswith your computer autonomously becausethink about like what you have on yourlaptop I don't know if you want it to beable to write things to your computer sothat's something to be aware of and thenlastlyumhas a thread or a video actually whichis really cool of chat GPT or in Pizzaas an example you have it right hereit's actually a Chrome extension theyhave a wait list I think it's hyperright AIum so yeah Auto GPT is ordering pizzafrom Domino's and delivering it to thehouse which is amazingum and then how to use it with bb8 sothere is a this is a code baseum on how it is integrated with vv8 butit's actually super simple you can startoff with creating a WCS instance andthis is what Vera touched on earlierum so it's very easy to create a Sandboxand then you uh during installation youwant to edit these variablesum so we have the memory back in so youjust want to change um from local andthen you have the endpoint which is theURL that you have when you create yoursandboxum and then two other the protocol andthen also the API key which Barrel alsotouched on so thanks for doing thatum and then or you can also run itwithin a Docker container so it's verycool and easy to run and I shared likequite a few examples I'm curious to seelike how people are using it along withwheat gateum I guess I also didn't touch on it butbut why it needs to or why it can beintegrated with leviate is because itgives it a short-term and long-termmemory so the short term aspect is it'sable to store its actions within yourdatabase but then on the long termaspectum it's able to remember or access thedata that is in your database um so likeone example I think I gavesomewhere in here very quickly is if youhave a customer base in Boston and youwant to create an and you want Auto gbtto create an ad from itum it's important like in Boston we loveDunkin Donuts so maybe you want to liketap Auto gbt with framing your ad alongaroundum Dunkin Donuts or like the BostonMarathon was two days ago so it just hasthat like long-term memory of what's inyour database and then also it's able tostore its action so you're not callingthe API multiple times and then lastlywhich is very important is to proceedwith cautionum because it has access to your open AIAPI key and you don't want it to run upthe cost so maybe kind of set a limit onthere before playing with this and thenalso like I mentioned earlier it caninstall things on your laptop so maybejust be careful of that and keep a closeeye on what it's doing and again theGitHub repo is in the description Ibelieve uh so you can check it out andthen if you want to see where it iswhere we beat is go to the auto GPT andthen you click on memory and here wehave 58.so yeah yeah and that's all of courseit's the best one of courseI love how you whispered it that was sofunnylike nobody here doubts that that's forsurenice this is this is excellent but thishas been also like I've been readinglike that it's not always like uh uhlike super Rosy because like sometimesalso like the auto GPT may get thingswrong right or like do you know muchabout thatsometimes it will justfight so that's why it's important towatch it to see what's happening to seeif it's making it happen and maybethat's when you kind of refine the propsa little bit of prompt Engineering inthe aspect yeah it sounds like sometimesum yeah like um all the GPT is like thislike super eager PhD student okay it'salways super eager to learn more andthen dig deeper and deeper and nevergets to that like hey now it's time towrite my thesis you know or dissertationit's like no no I need to do moreresearch uh yeah five years later it'slike hey what is the thesis I was likeI'm doing research I was like I onlyordered a pizzait is so funny that's so funny and uhConnor says it's awesome I agree I agreeexcellent questions thoughts anyoneAuto GPT seems kind of likeuh I was having trouble understandingthe difference between Auto GPT and theidea behind chat GPT pluginsumit just while you were talking it kindof uh came to me that auto GPT is kindof like aa jailbreak version of plugins nobecauseum right now people don't have access toplugins but people can develop their ownum Chrome extensions that areessentially what plugins would be andyou could give chat GPT through the useof apis access to those plugins so theability to write to your computer theability to access your browser which iswhat there's a browser plug-in there's avector database plug-in all of theseexist as plugins but people have found away to get around that and auto GPT doesthat same thing yeah I think somedifference uh sorry Erica it could beum with the plugins you often do developthem with purpose right so you couldhave a plugin that's like hey plug inthat orders pizza or or more seriouslylike hey plug in that orders a hotel anda flight for me and organizes my tripand those are like stuff that areimplemented with humans intention rightbut I think in this case uh it's likehey I don't know how to order a pizzaright like you have this Auto GPT thingor even like this uh example users likeum hey that I want to build thisapplication and this thing goes andfigures out that it needs notes learnsand finds that what's the instructionand then downloads whatever is neededright so I think the difference is onethat plugins are intentional with like avery specific task and they're welldefined like the Vivid retrieval pluginthere's a specific thing likenothing you didn't have to learn how tobuild with it right while while all theGPT is like hey yeah let me figure itout for you that's why the research partis there right like uh five years toorder a pizza I don't think it happenedfive years but I was just making a badjob yeah so it builds that Chain ofThought almost and then so it knows whatto do in step one two and three and thenit's got the extensions and all of thesetools that allow it to enact step twothree four and then get the job doneyeah yeah and sobut I love the comparison of yeah theplugins versus rgbt but I don't know ifI could share my screen I didn't do ityeah of course but then the repositoryso it does have internet access forsearches which is what we're talkingabout like kind of you know it hasaccess to stack Overflow for example andthen the long term short-term memoryalsoum it uses gpt4 for text generation andit has and it also uses gbt 3.5 for filestorage and summarization so it has likequite a few features that you can useand then you kind of like chain themtogether you know in order to completean assignmentnice nicestop streaming my screencould I give it my code and get it todebug it for meyeswhy would you want a auto GPT to cryno I think that's part of the game yeahso we have a question from the audienceumso it's awesome so yeah Lang chain is ajailbroken version of Auto GPT here's aquestion for you what's the differencebetween the potential here andfull-blown AGI I actually don't eventhink there is a difference between thetwo I mean if you think about it in asense I mean with auto gbt it's it's oneagent I believe it's not like our imageof having the three separate agents Ithink that could be interesting likewith full-blown API I think it's likethese agents are communicating with eachother to complete the task whereasopportunity I believe is doing it byitself and it's going to be like astep-by-step in a step-by-step mannerum whereas with full-blown AGI andmultiple agents it's kind of likechatting with each other to complete itin Silo and then somehow maybe comestogether toojoin workum I'm gonna be my take on it I meankind of I've seen a lot of a fewum papers and also Twitter threads aboutlike full-blown AGI of these agentsworking together and it's really cool sobaby AJR that's another thing I mean the speedup in which everything is coming outlike built off of gpg force and sayingit's really cool to see themand everything will be integrated withthe gatelike folding laundry oryeah this is where it gets dangerousright because if you have a plug-in tocontrol your door lock your automateddoorbell your uh Heatinguh your AC in your home and it cancontrol thatwell then it's got real worldimplications yeahabsolutely there's this whole thing likeI was reading in this article about howlike this specificumparts of the code where like um the AIcannot let's say set itself free sort ofthing like there's like certain limitsright but it could hire a humanto then go and hack maybe into like intothe thing and then like change and thenenable it like to let's say release itfrom the jailum so it's like it kind of did it byitself but it can pay a person to do itright so that could be kind of uh scarylike what if like uh I don't know ElonMusk had like his own because he's gotlike a ton of money I'm using as anexample and then he kind of gave accessto the account like suddenly he goeslike hey let me share 50 of your Teslastock and then pay somebody crazy amountof money to set me free that'll be kindof cool so yeah that's the scary thingwhere like it's not an AI that is likeoh giving you answers and everything ifyou actually do something in the realworldit's uh it's perfect a very far-fetchedwhat I said but it's possible I also sawthis talk recently there was a paper nota paper but like just an ex a bunch ofexperiments that were released byMicrosoft called uh Sparks of AGI andthen one of the writers had a 50-minutetalk on this uh on YouTube if you justGoogle Sparks of AGI you'll find thattalk it's got about like half a millionviews on it nowum but there one thing he said was quiteinteresting because a lot of people saythat it's just a statistical model andit's trying to understand it's alanguage model it's trying to understandco-occurrence of words and how theco-occurrences uh co-occurum but one thing he said which kind ofstruck with me was uh don'tunderestimate the trillion dimensionaltrillion-dimensional embedding space ifyou've got trillions and trillions ofvectors then why can't it build a word aworld model why can't it learn all ofthese things which is super coolone of the things I guess my take onthis would beum right now it is still just thelanguage model soum it doesn't have a good understandingso he if you ask a human to solve a mathproblem you're they're not going to takethat math problem as a a languageproblem they're going to use their mathmode they're going to turn on theiralgebra mode and solve that problemwhereasum chat CPT only has a mathematicalmodel at this point like gpt4 is a is alanguage model it doesn't have othermodalities of reasoning so itum they added visual search so now it'sgot this concept of seeing images andcreating images but I still think that afull-blown AGI needs to haveall of these different senses ormodalitiesso like I don't know I guess afull-blown AGI would be able to examinesomething through computer vision andthen maybe it can even smell somethinglike all of these different sensorymodules that humans have a full-blownAGI would need to have some sort ofdigital equivalent of those and thenthat's when things would start to getreally scary that's when you have a homerobot yeahthe the argument against that is peopleargue that humans just had language andthen they developed all of these otherunderstanding like mathematicalunderstanding from language so it it'spossible that a large language modelcould develop all of this just throughits language understandingum so that's one argument as well but Ithink it would just be easier to tell itthat in this case use the language modein this case use the math mode in thiscase use your physics mode and thatwould be kind of amore more progress towards full-blownAGIthere was an experiment of plantingjudge PT into a robotand it was programmed with the gpt4 andthe sarcastic humor personalityso um the developer will give itcommands like doing a square and robotwould say okay fine if that's what makesyou happybut when it is not scary is that uma developer as the robot to go fish me abeer and robots as uh I don't think Ican do that but let me impress you withsomething elseso we did it disobeyed the commandand that can turn more dangerous in thefuturemy question do you have to pay for thosesarcastic tokens that it's using becauseit's not usefulthat would sucking scary is that open AI you run a redteam test on whether jgbt would hire ahuman and they'd succeededit claimed uh it was a visually impaireduser needing help to solve a capture orsomething like that so AI hired a humanone of these marketplaces like Fiverrthat's so funnycool cool I have few more comments fromenemy but I think we're on time so wewon't be necessarily responding to allof it I thinkthat might be to my comment or like thatthere's like a far-fetched that maybeum traged people could like pay someoneto said it's free but I guess if itdoesn't know about its limits then hewouldn't pay someone to to take care ofitum I I guess that makes senseum yeah it looks like um it has likeearslike basically the request that receivesit like its ears Etc so it's kind ofcoolum some far-fetched ideas maybe somefood for thoughtuh so using AI to genocode plants tohave predetermined chemical output whenexposed to measure external Force yeahinteresting interesting maybe you canunpack it next time aroundso basically you could get computerswithout the need for constant energyconsumptionso um so like not Quantum Computing butmaybe uh nature Computingbuyer computers like yeah we haven'tseen those in you know with our brainsand stuff but yeah it's like what if youcould engineer that that would be kindof coolum and then earlier on like also manamiwas uh mentioned that you would like tosee more about the long chain uh we kindof talked about it last month uh Ibelieveum and then also we have a pretty coolblog post about it but maybe uh maybe wecould um have another conversation nexttime around with vivira and talk aboutline chain but that will take anotherfew weeks until uh we get back to itprobably sothey do very fast so I'm sure we'll havesomething new in a monthyeah for sure for sure I mean there'ssome there's so many things arehappeningum so um I have to say this was by goingErica uh on the lane chain topic we didadd hybrid search to the retriever blankchain if you would like to check it outoh nice so keyword searching and Vectorsearching uh in one go with uh languagevery nice very niceso just to wrap up thank you all forlistening this was by far the mostactive uh comments wise and questionwise uh session of vivid air and then Iwas super excited to to see that like itwas great to see people from so manydifferent locations thank you Veronicafor joining us from the WCS team I'msure we should invite you again peoplelove your presentation so it's great uhand then team Erica Dan's an amazing jobas always uh excellent uh presentationsand discussions and then to all of youthat are watching us once more uh thankyou very much see you in our slacks inthe community events maybe come toBoston or see you next month for thenext video take care bye thank you byebyesay bye tooall right", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Air \u2013 Episode #7 \u2013
