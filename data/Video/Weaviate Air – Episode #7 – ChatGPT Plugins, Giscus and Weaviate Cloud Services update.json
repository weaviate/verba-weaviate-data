{"text": "Planned topics: * ChatGPT Plugins and Weaviate * What is new in Weaviate Cloud Services * Giscus \u2013 feedback/discussions ... \nforeign [Music] this is episode 7 so uh it's a lucky seven lucky for you because we have a special guest in the studio with us it's a in a studio well it's like well in the air somewhere we have Veronica from the movie cloud services team which is amazing and the usual suspect from the devil team Dan Erica and Zen so uh hello everyone and I also brought in just for today's call these two guys so these are my meerkats the skinny guy is also a meerkat by the way it was a gift that down brought from South Africa which is kind of cool so it's a really really cool so thank you for watching thank you for listening uh we really really appreciate your time that you spend with us so so it's really really good um if you want to help this this channel uh give the video a like whether you watch it live or later on you know like time is is an interesting concept right like this is happening live and yet you will be able to watch it years from now which is really cool um and then the best thing about actually being live is the ability to ask questions so please feel free to ask questions as we go I'll try to monitor the questions sometimes people answer them like uh directly on the YouTube channel uh but but we'll also try to address them and then I'll share them with everybody else so that's it about like the the usual uh intro and then we have four topics that we would like to cover today so the first topic that we will talk about is discuss or actually how can you share your feedback with us directly on the VBA website which is really cool so Dan will talk to you about that um the next thing that we have and that's why we have Veronica here is what's new in the Vivid cloud services like you maybe you'll get some secrets from one of the engineers that was building it so this is really cool no pressure Vera is going to be great for sure um there's also a lot of things happening oh this is a new graphic that we have uh a lot of things happening around like the charge EPT retrieval plugins and then there is our plugins in general so then we'll talk to you about the the plugin that works with vv8 I'm sure he'll be able to explain it way better than I do uh and then finally last but not least there's been so much excitement around Auto GPT and then actually you can use Auto GPT with Vivid and Erica is going to cover that for us and of course we all have a nice chat about it and then have some questions so feel free to drop questions and also as a second things like just drop us a message just for warm up say hey where are you watching from you know like or like is this the first episode that you're watching I is this like a second or a third Heck if you saw all seven I'll send you a t-shirt like you can lie I will not have a way to to test but the first person to say maybe you'll get a t-shirt you know and um Erica yeah you know the first comment yeah thanks for joining uh you already have a t-shirt so that would be cheating but um maybe I'll send you one special I pretended all seven so you attended all seven right like you're a real Pro um so really really great so that's it for the warm up let's dive into um discuss so done what can you tell us about it because like you worked on it um and uh it's actually pretty cool project and um I feel like people really enjoy learning about it yes hi everyone um so viscous is a commenting widget and the motivation was to give developers an easy way to interact with our documentation to give us a thumbs up or some feedback or else qualification questions and so far the way you do that you'd have to go to GitHub find our project not find an issue but let's say you read the blog post and I have a question about Auto GPT you can simply type it in this comment widget down here you don't have to go to GitHub you don't have to find the correct product it's right there so um these comments pertain to the blog or to our documentation for instance let's say you want to check out the new embedded leviate feature that we launched recently and do I read a documentation you realize that we don't talk about modules so you can leave a comment something like what modules are enabled by default and I log into GitHub so I see this comment button if you are commenting for the first time you're going to see a button to sign in with GitHub once you authorize that your comment will post and uh comments end up in the ev8 Io Io repo in the discussion tab and I've refreshed the page and you see it here there was a document on page and um everything is done through GitHub so your identity will be preserved there you can see this was my username and this is a comment I left and if you simply want to express your appreciation for the fantastic job that we've been doing on this you can also give us a heart or even say that the page rocks and that will also be reflected right here on and the GitHub discussion so the way we built this was initially we looked at um popular commenting widgets one of them was discuss they all love this sport mantle between discussion and something um but this has this class was not open source and uh it also tracks users so we looked at open source options and found this cast which is um project that is building a common system powered by GitHub discussions what we saw earlier so um this has advantage that it's all open source and it's stored on GitHub along with uh our code and the issues you can link to each numbers and you can create a new shot of a discussion so we are going to do that when we triage comments and it's easy to export anything if we ever want to move to a different system in the future thanks to the GitHub apis and it's a really useful discussion system that you may be interested in adopting for your own open source project pretty easy to get started with we made a few customization to have um both the name here and the path because sometimes the name can be ambiguous like installation but the path is ambiguated but essentially it was a pretty story for integration so yeah we welcome your comments on both blog posts or the documentation just scroll to the bottom and give us some nice emojis or some constructive feedback excellent excellent um I mean it's always like I love like when you're like yeah give us feedback but not just feedback make it constructive right like uh be nice about it like even if something is uh you know needs a bit of change and help like uh be constructive but I'll definitely encourage everyone else to kind of like check it out um and and also I know and I think Dan is about to show it for every blog post that we have uh we also have discussions at the bottom so if you read one of the blog posts or all of them like uh like you should um and you find it interesting or you have like some question follow follow-up questions uh that could be a pretty cool place to do that and the latest blog was already got some likes Etc so that's really really cool to uh actually I let's see who these people were yeah John yeah so like yeah let's let's get some emojis and uh from from the community like is uh right now there's 15 people I can see watching so uh why not right I'm curious um and maybe I can stop sharing your screen for now um how long did you take to implement that like what was like um from the moment you knew it's going to be discuss like how long did you take for that um in terms of absolute hours I don't know something like four I would say but it was much more difficult to do the market research for this and um see what implications discuss has versus discuss so I would say four plus a few more for testing and debugging and um there are a few points that don't work that well if you only leave an emoji we still say documentation comment on that page there's actually there's no comment to adjust the Emojis so I I've been trying to tweak that but I don't have a good solution so far we might have in the future something like reactions on the post as opposed to comments on it nice nice but this is the thing right like if uh people in the audience see this and like we've already done the research and if you like what what you have like uh yeah you could you could get it done in like half a day maybe a day that's pretty impressive time yeah that it takes to integrate this the offers we did an internal testing and so how we graduated and all that but um now that you know it's uh it's a good widget to adopt you can do it much faster than we did excellent I think I think for me what this improves a lot is the workflow on feedback for uh blogs and documentation so after I wrote that um chat TPT plugin blog I got emails Twitter responses people reached out on the slack channel so there's like a thousand different channels that you can ask questions but the most relevant one now would just be discus because I would be following that and we can have a conversation there you can of course email me and reach out to me through whatever Channel but this would be I would be watching out for questions there so my response rate would be very high on giskus so now we have like one Central channel for questions feedback everything related to a blog post you uh people in the comments right so you can do that if I want to share the screen I cannot show how that works if you know that on GitHub but um so in here you are in GitHub discussions and you can say Sebastian please answer this um but in here there's no Auto completion and that's the last limitation of the plugin so to expand a bit more on the implementation uh this is uh the web component and then there is a gizkas or react component that we used and that made it easier to implement once we found out about it and the bulk of the work so I didn't include this in the four hours the book was to actually go through each page of our site and make sure the footer had a reference to this widget because we have different types of blog posts and different Footers some of them are called to action hey us vv8 others are stay in touch depends on the context so um is not impossible that most of the work would be actually to just place the widget in your footer if that's not a uniform piece of content nice nice cool no question so now it's a shout out time so you know at the beginning I asked our audience like where people are watching uh from and uh so we have Brent from Canada Ottawa so uh Zen maybe not not too far off although Canada is so huge that's probably far far enough um then you have deep we have deep from London uh we have Sila from Netherlands uh then you already hand waving and then we have virenda from in Indiana USA and then we have Marco from Milan so uh welcome everyone to Vivid air we are super happy to have you here and uh hopefully just this shout out alone was enough hey and we have someone from Lisbon Portugal ottman um FYI Portugal is my one of my favorite countries in Europe uh so like definitely uh excited to see somebody from Lisbon and uh any excuse to go there by the way it's it's a good thing for me so maybe I should go and meet ottman that would be cool um I'm trying to hide the banner but it's not hiding maybe he's just not showing for me there we go as a delay all right so perfect so that's uh now we have Veronica that will talk to us about WCS Vera should I share your screen yes please all right so all right so I'm already logged in this is our new WCS we launched it around three weeks ago so what I prepared for you today is the sandbox which is the free sandbox it's a free cluster and you you have 14 days to use that and you can see here some details like URL the Vivid version information about API keys and expiration date etc etc the next two are about their paid clusters with the standard plan so one which I prepared for you is the one with the lower wee bit version about that in a second or maybe we will go through it right now because we need couple of minutes to wait for the update so here um let's say that we get deployed cool new features and I really really would like to use them so we prepared the solution that is just one click now and you have to provide the cluster name and thus click confirm what is happening now we have heard here the notification that it's starting and here you go you cannot delete the cluster because it's in a progression State on or query it because this is the version without the high availability and after a couple of minutes you will see that the Vivid version is the newest one and while we are talking about that the newest version is 118.3 and it enables some cool features for our users about that in a second um hey Vera this is amazing this this is actually amazing because like sometimes uh like especially when we have like a new release of weaviate right and uh I always kind of go like uh yeah like but I really want to straight up like start using this and then sometimes in the past I'll just go like hey I'll create a new version and then migrate my data over but now I can just click the button wait for a few minutes and then I can start using whatever is latest and greatest so this is amazing I don't know we could do that exactly just like that one click and the other so the magic is happening underneath we are already 50 so that's why we are slowly move to the next Topic in the meantime which is the eight like is management so lots of users they were um they requesting that it would be really great if we have some API keys to have access to the cluster of course this is a great idea because based on this example for for example I can tell you that this is the sandbox so the free cluster and I during the creation so let's go maybe just to create a cluster so I picked a free sandbox and this is the uh the authentication is enabled by default which is always great to have one um so let's go back because I wanted just to show you that we have such option oh and we have to take a pause because like you can see the Vivid version update is already done it was quicker than I thought so that's that's nice wow that was so easy yeah it's so easy and and fast I I thought that I have more time so we have already here the newest version and uh we can just use our cluster and query it and fit with with new cool data so once we go to the sandbox which is the API Keys management we can see that I enabled the authentication during the when I was clicking on the form and by clicking on a key I see oh okay I can see I have my API keys I have the admin okay I can see the example header which I can copy and use that for example I would like to share my cluster with with Joe Sebastian and but I don't want to give you my credentials to WCS so now you can query the the cluster because I will share with you the URL of the cluster and the API key and we will go there in two minutes because there is more about API keys so now we released a couple of days ago the the new cool feature which is the managed API Keys it means you can add or remove existing Keys it's also really easy so let's go and add a new API key could be read only so on the access to read the data or full admin access we can go maybe with them with only one generate and we can see that the process started it's already in progress it takes couple of minutes and while talking about that let's go to the another cluster and maybe just to remove some keys because I don't want to use this key anymore because I think that this is not in usage and it's better to have always only the the keys we are using and that's it it's already removed and to for those two clusters action is in progress of course it takes a couple of minutes again but you can do it you know on your own you don't have to ask anyone you don't have to find anything this is just a click and it's easy and I think it's really fast and will be helpful for our users oh we have 50 already all right nice yeah hey so I have a question or in a comment right so first of all I think you'll be one of the first people that would want uh ability to delete the keys because like right now like let's say you compromise your clusters because you share the cloud the keys with the world exactly like they're all 700 people that are watching us live that's a real number uh I'm not going to be copying trying to hacking into our environment and that's kind of uh really useful right because yes by mistake you committed your key to GitHub repo or you showed it on a super popular Vivid air uh you could just delete it and then like nobody can get access to it um but I also really love the ability to split the read and write keys because let's say if for backend operations you have the right key for uh mod for modifying the data Etc but if you want to build a website then later on that uses WIBI to search you should only ever use read key right yes so that's really really cool yeah I'm very excited about ish and uh I already used the keys before but I didn't know that you could actually change the keys and generate new ones that's really cool yeah that's our the newest feature so let's see what we've got here so yeah we have one more key uh already added to our cluster and here I was removing one right so I don't know if it's yeah I removed one of the read-only keys and it's removed but the operation is not finished yet but no problem it will be done a couple of minutes uh of course I will remove all data I prefer for you guys today this is of course the the thing I don't want to pay for all of those clusters I mean waves cheap you know yeah I know I know right um very good price all right so one more thing maybe let's um because I know that we have lots of users that they have already clusters which are deployed not by us but they are somewhere in a cool place so you can add this cluster here in external clusters section and just query it in the query module so as a test let's type data except for example cluster and I have prepared of course something for you so the URL save and doing that we can go to the query module and as a locked in user I can see all clusters so the manage clusters and the sandboxes and I can easily query them so this is the one I prepared with with data exactly yeah okay so the query cannot be empty of course so let's go there and see what we have there are some for sure pretty basic example but I would like to show you that that it's working and so I'm a login custom user here so we can see that yeah okay I can access the data everything is fine but in a case we were discussing before so what in the case that I would like to someone would like to see the data but not change the data of course and I don't want to share my credentials to WCS so let's just log out and we can see the start screen so let's go there and use the same cluster we were querying now so I'm pretending I'm the different person the new team member so I have to face the cluster URL and Sebastian of course name or one cluster and click connect we are in a we are in a query module so here in the beginning we didn't support text and a cluster querying but now we are so we have two options because you can be logged in and just class query your cluster or you can do the thing we were discussing before so now we can see we are unauthorized right because I'm logged out and I didn't use the authorization header so now let's go and just add it and this is the same cluster I was using when I was logged in so we need the key organization now let's paste the read-only key API key which is like that click again and like you can see again I have a I have an access to the cluster and I can query this is so amazing um Erica was actually clapping she was so excited this is so awesome wow so that would be it from my side what I wanted to show you today and thank you perfect this is a great uh presentation anybody else have questions before I ask some more maybe from the audience as well but they're in here I don't have a question but I was talking to um so there was a someone new to Evie who was interested in this and all I did was send them a link to WCS and the next email I had with them was how do I upload documents to my webia cluster like the whole process is so seamless and straightforward that I didn't have multiple interactions oh this is not working how do I do this it was literally send them a link and then they want to see how I can how they can upload documents to it from that point on so this is great nice nice and we have a nice comment from Brent thank you Brent um yeah Vera if you are on the free tier can you also update your instance even though I mean I guess like if you're creating a cluster around the same time that there's a release no no um for now we don't have a feature for sandbox to be updated uh but when there is a plan to have one we'll have one but as I know now there is no uh plans for that and sandboxes are now only valid for 14 days so maybe maybe that's that's the reason as well so yeah there shouldn't be too many version changes right in those 14 days might have a different idea but yeah sure um and then also since our ctOS here he's dropped the comment um like yeah it's actually he's so right just a few months ago it was a bunch of mock-ups like we had like the old WCS but the new one it's so great to see then and I agree with it at the end amazing demo Vera I know you are a bit nervous before but like hey yeah yeah no reasons to be nervous whatsoever you did great um thank you questions anyone else sorry Dan you go I had another question about the free tier like America um the uh API key that's only available for those it's not available for the free tier right yes it is there is one one key available I think this is the admin one but we cannot wait we cannot change it or you know delete or add a new one for now for the free cluster let's just take a look yeah you you have just the one default one during the creation process right there's no read only here okay there yes wow you should upgrade anybody who wants a read only key if there is a needs the rule we read only read on Nikki another ways like share your feedback with us right and tell us so that would definitely definitely work um just before you I give you the floor to Erica we have another comment very impressive from Brad's thanks Brad thank you keep the comments uh coming everyone that's great also there will be a tutorial and blog posts on authorization so um Vera touched on it um and she showed all the corner capabilities but next week we'll be releasing something that can also help further help the community users yeah and about that maybe you can already um say that the future about the updating cluster is pretty neat because with the version 1183 you can use the open AI um API key in the query module so because we wait accepts that so I think that it's really great information for our users I have another question from the community but I'm not sure if that's like a for us to handle maybe something I mean does anyone know here or maybe something at the end could help with do we know is there a plan to download models like with the self-hosted docker or okay it's for instance to get clip the only thing that's part of what we are supposed to do with WCS right yeah yeah maybe we should go pray to the mighty Etienne who's watching the session maybe respond on the comments because I don't think any of us know the answer to that um right question from Brad is the cloud service running on AWS all right so our service is running on Google Cloud but if we are talking about clusters it's coming soon so you can deploy then your cluster in the WCS or or in a AWS I'm sorry or Google cloud or maybe in the future for sure in the future Azure cloud and based on that there will be more and more configuration that it's that the user gets really the you know the the cluster if he or she needs perfect and I also know like in between like a self-hosted and like using WCS we are we also have like uh the hybrid model so if you have like your own like a set of private VPN or other clusters and then you won't reviate uh like connect with Vivid cloud services we can offer that so we can help help with establishing it and then do the whole like hosting uh within your own environment so that's like also like it could be very useful for like government organizations maybe where you go like hey this has to exist on our uh clouds uh and then you can't go anywhere else so that's definitely an option yeah and uh to your uh response this cloud service will be an easy sell for me now we are glad we converted you Brad thank you perfect any final comments before we move on to Zen all right no comments so thank you Vera and there may be some questions later we could always come back to you uh but now uh let's uh talk business with Zen then what do you have for us yeah so maybe I can so I'll show this a little bit later but what I wanted to talk about was the uh chat GPT retrieval plugin um and so people are going crazy about chat GPT and how you can get it to well how you can get it to do things that it can't do properly right now so one of the uh issues is that it doesn't handle mathematical problems well first of all because it's language and it doesn't understand um math appropriately so with the release of plugins you could give it a math mode so like Wolfram Alpha could be the math mode for chat GPT and that's enabled through a plugin to to Wolfram Alpha um and then we wrote a blog post around this that uh that will post in the um in the uh in the description but this is what the blog post was uh I wanted to cover one particular plugin uh which is the one that we developed for uh for chat GPT and essentially how this plugin works is quite similar to our generative search functionality um except now what happens is let's say you have we V8 and you've got a bunch of your own documents these can be anything from your own textbooks if you're a student you want to conduct search over your textbooks and you want chat cpg to answer questions with respect to those textbooks or it can be your own like personal company document it can be your entire Enterprise your policy your HR documents you can put them into Eva and essentially how the retrieval plug-in uh works for chat GPT is you would just go to chat CPT as regular to their website you would enable the plugin and then you send you submit a prompt to chat TPT and usually what would happen is if you ask a question about um what days do I get off or how many uh how many work from home days do I get chat CPT would say I have no uh information about your particular scenario right um but now what it does instead is it realizes that I have a connected Vector database so I have this sort of memory or this uh store of relevant information that I should go look at before I tell you I don't have any information so it's a way to in the short term augment the memory of a a large language model with anything that you find relevant enough to put into the vector database so basically what it will do is before it tells you yeah I don't know if you give it a very specific prompt it'll query the vector database and then the vector database comes back with a relevant document so it conducts the search and it sends the document to Chachi PT and then it reads through it and if it finds an answer to your prompt it'll it'll send you a customized response and so this is super cool because now similar to the generative search functionality you can just go into chat GPT well not now but when you have access to this so right now this is an alpha very few limited people have access to this but when you do get access to it eventually you can go to chatgpt and I can actually show that component of this so here you could go here and then you won't have access to this right now so it's in Alpha but you could go down here and then you would be able to see the uh V8 retrieval plug-in here you could simply install it so these are the only few that are kind of officially accepted at this point but we're in the process of going through this as well so you would install it and then now you could ask a question and then it would work on your uh your own uh document I can show a video of this actually as well over here so this is a video that Sebastian recorded where here he's going in yeah so that's what the retrieval plugin looks like and so this is a question that only the vector database has information about chat tpd doesn't know about so you can see that it uses the retrieval plug-in here and then you can ask it further questions the interesting thing here that I want to point out let me Zoom back up for a second notice what it does here okay so you ask it a question and then it uses the plugin and then it uses the plugin again that's an interesting thing that I want to talk about a little bit later on but I'll let this whole thing complete out you can have a follow-up conversation with it so when we created this video uh chat GPT could query leviate to get information that it thought was relevant to answering a question so the what what we have now which is version 2. version 2 is that you can actually go and insert documents through a query through writing a prompt and then also delete documents through writing a prompt so in this blog post I mentioned that this would be super cool because you could tell chat TPT something and you could ask it to remember it for next time or put a store into its Vector database memory and instead of calling the query endpoint as is shown here it would just call the upsert endpoint and it would actually insert objects into Eva you can also call the delete endpoint by telling it to forget something forget a particular document or forget that you told it a particular detail and that would call the delete endpoint and it would remove objects from leviate so it's a you're basically upserting querying deleting things just by talking to chat GPT which is which is pretty scary but it's also super cool as well that's really cool for the example that you gave of like company policy documents it's like what if it changes yeah and you kind of need to update that and that's cool that we could just do that Within yeah you don't even have to go to alleviate to do that you don't have to like call at a particular endpoint you can ask chatgpt to call the endpoint for you um digging further into that question the super interesting thing with chat GPT and plugins is that you would think that they you have you tell it how to call the query endpoint or how to query the vector database but that's not actually true when you uh when you create the plugin which if anybody's interested you can actually see the code for the weeviate retrieval plugin over here but when you create the uh the plugin you have to create a manifest and in that manifest you have to tell uh chat GPT what the endpoints you're exposing are and you have to describe them so for our endpoints we have the query endpoint which has a description of retrieve objects from your alleviate Vector database there's an absurd delete there's all sorts of endpoints there we just describe them uh we never actually tell chat epd the syntax with which to use those endpoints so it doesn't really know how to query but it uses your code and your description of the code so your comments to understand how it should query V8 and how I realized this was so if I go back to this video you see here you see how it tried it first and it didn't work this is because it's learning how to query the database in real time so it failed the first time and then it realized okay let me try a different way and then it realized how to query the database and then from that point on every time you query so now if you ask it another question and if I let it run you see how it works on the first try it's because it it made a mistake it learned how to query it and then every time from that point on it just uses the same syntax to query so that's something super cool that is not apparent in the uh in the kind of the face of the blog or the video itself um but you you can actually communicate it how to use your plugin and it will use it accordingly which I thought was was super interesting yeah and if you if you jump straight to the end because that'll be a Shameless plug by the way uh if you go like way way to the end like you could probably just uh jump there um until we we have the like the final answer so yeah post here so FYI this this actually is factually correct we are looking for developer Advocates uh to to join with it so uh this is not made up like this is one of the roles we're hiring so anyone that would like to join that you know this thing here um hey we're looking for people so always always cool um I also thought like of this and by the way like uh one uh thing like a non-excite big excuse but uh normally would show you this life uh the thing will happen is we like to leave dangerously so we're updating the plugin and then sort of broke it a little bit so that's why we're not showing it live live because basically right now if you ask questions uh charge if you just like uh gives us an error because we broke the the current version of the test plugin yeah but that's okay there's a good reason actually because I mentioned here uh before in version 1.0 we only have the query endpoint that was exposed to chat TPT now we have delete and um and insert or the upstairs endpoint so you can add it you can get it to remember and forget things so um we'll have a blog post on that coming out soon so yeah look forward to that and we have a question a couple of questions so does charge GPD store data from your documents via the plugin uh by by store data do you mean update the yeah so let me interpret this I'm assuming here you mean it can store new information into the vector database via the plugin and the answer is yes so the end point here instead of using query it would use a separate endpoint called the upsert endpoint and you would tell it let's say that you've told it that uh you work for Wi-Fi and vva is looking for a developer Advocate role if you want to tell it the developer Advocate role is based out of San Francisco or based out of Silicon Valley remember this for me it will actually absurd it into alleviate for you that's the super cool thing with version two that were that we're working on right now yeah but but also by the way like as you see on um like on the diagram there's a vv8 instance itself you also also this is a vivid instance like that with all the functionality that you would expect so usually the process will be like hey if you have 10 000 documents that you want to drop in you'd use the usual way right like just just insert the data into vv8 and then chart GPT will be able to query the database to get its answers right but I think this addition is also going like hey not only can I do it by API uh like Zen was explained like you could do it through uh yeah telling chart GPT out this object um so cool I think we all need access now well well here's the fun part and then we are planning so there is this conference odsc East which is in Boston uh I think it's like 9 to 11 of May and there's going to be a hackathon that will be working with charging PD plugins and weaviate and uh I think the idea is to have like 10 teams in there um and then the the every team will get access to the chargerpd plugins so um you know that could be one way to get access like LED access um maybe I can share the link to the hackathon a bit later um we have another question uh so from Brent so the Manifest addresses the content of allowing editing deleting of certain classes yeah so you right now you would have to specify where to add let's say you have multiple classes you would have to specify which class to add it into um and so the Manifest has that particular syntax but in your in your talk with chai TPT you would have to specify those details as well nice nice and uh we get some encouragement now so like uh hey we all break code half the time um that is so true that is so true um although when I was younger and now I thought I was like I'm such a great engineer like I never write tests I just write good code I'm such a like I was so full of I don't want to say what but yes we've all done that many times in our lives so it's cool and then another word of a question from manami uh please continue open source effort you're doing the entire world of favor um that's so nice thank you Monami cool any more questions ideas oh one more thing I guess um so a lot of people were super interested in plugins so right now we're looking at how um kind of showing you the story underneath how we created this plugin and the reason why we want to do that is so that because the process is quite General if you wanted to create a plug-in once you did get access you would go through similar steps you would just have different endpoints and you would describe to chat GPT how to use those endpoints so if you had let's say a a Pizza Hut endpoint and you wanted to order from Pizza Hut specifically you would describe the endpoints differently and everything else would be quite similar so you could you could uh you know create your own endpoint and you can tell that I'm hungry from my example I can always tell when you're hungry that's fine I don't I don't I don't need AI for it um cool and then I have one more question from FS how can I add documents as charge GPT user to the database yeah so you would at first there's uh two ways you could just hook up to your weeviate instance and as Sebastian says uh upload the documents um as as you would regularly so that would be in not through chat GPT so you would just insert documents here so that your instance knew about them the second way is uh you could tell chat CPT to upsert a document or to remember a document and it would call the upsert endpoint so this is version 1.0 in the flow chart but in version 2.0 there will be another endpoint that it can call and it can insert documents one at a time for you um so the difference there would be like Sebastian said if you're inserting ten thousand a hundred thousand a million objects you wouldn't tell chat CPD to insert it one by one you would actually have to go through Eva and then batch them and loop through it and uh insert it that would be much more efficient but if you're having a chat with chat GPT and you you say here's a new detail insert it that would be a much more easier way to upsert through touching yeah I think the upsetting through charge GPT to where I could see is like let's say uh like we showed this example that the the company policies and the roles and then like yes see our uh people and culture person she could all hey the policy now changed now we have additional benefits so she could kind of go like HR GPD now the benefits for the companies are blah blah blah and then I think that could be like a really good use case but yeah in general like yeah there'll be a lot of copy pasting if you want to use the main chart GPD as like the way to insert uh not to say expensive because also I think that every interaction there's some sort of clicks and tokens that are involved so um for efficiency I would say like of like uploading loads of documents just go straight to vb8 um we'll like the database is so efficient at it and really good at it like that's probably the best way in perfect this is this is great I love I love the conversation and everything like Vera what do you think exciting stuff would you use that yes lots of new knowledge for me in that area So the plan is that probably I will start you know using it or learning more about that nice nice yeah it's always cool to come and learn here so I'm so happy you're here that's so cool Okay so like I mentioned earlier um Erica's already getting excited so tell us what do you have for us Erica all right I'll be covering Auto GPT and how you can use with bb8 if you wouldn't mind sharing my screen I don't mind at all So Yesterday JP and I released a blog post on auto TPT and how you can use it with vv8 um I want to touch on this image here I really love how it's I guess I should first explain what Auto gbt is um so what it does is it leverages gpt4 and 3.5 to chain together different thoughts and complete tasks autonomously um so in this figure I don't know if you can see my mouse yeah um we have three people and they look like they're kind of like debating something right and then they have like these different workflows so that's kind of what Auto GPT is it's like you give it a task and now it's going to kind of create subtasks in order to complete that objective and it kind of just like Works within itself to do this um which is very cool um so what makes this different from um chat gbt is that with Chachi BT you have to prompt it right so you are queering or chatting with chat should be T like one by one and then you're refining the prompts so prompt engineering is a thing that has emerged from this um but with auto gbt like I said you just give it a task like order me pizza and it's like okay I need to find like local pizza stores nearby um figure out like what I've ordered in the past to see if I like cheese or pepperoni and then it's going to I guess it has a knowledge of my address and it's going to please do it and deliberate um so it's a really cool thing also I want to point out that it has gotten a lot of attention I mean I'm sure I'm like preaching to the choir but it jumped from 20 000 to 80 000 stars in a matter of days and I we broke this Monday and released it yesterday and right now it is at 90. three where do I say right here 93 almost 94 000. so it's growing quickly oh my God and thank you and you can see it uh jumping up like an insane amount anyway so that's a little bit about what it is and how it differs from uh and then the capabilities I included a few examples um from Twitter um so Sully shared a thread on using it to conduct market research I guess we could just show it um so here it has it's defining these different goals and then it kind of is going through the steps in order to do this then we have baroon um pointed out that um Auto gbt was tasked with creating an application and then it realized that sorry wrong one it realized that he didn't have a he didn't have node installed on Ninja's computer so Auto gbt took it upon itself to find a stack Overflow link and it installed node by itself which is kind of creepy um that it can do all of these tasks with your computer autonomously because think about like what you have on your laptop I don't know if you want it to be able to write things to your computer so that's something to be aware of and then lastly um has a thread or a video actually which is really cool of chat GPT or in Pizza as an example you have it right here it's actually a Chrome extension they have a wait list I think it's hyper right AI um so yeah Auto GPT is ordering pizza from Domino's and delivering it to the house which is amazing um and then how to use it with bb8 so there is a this is a code base um on how it is integrated with vv8 but it's actually super simple you can start off with creating a WCS instance and this is what Vera touched on earlier um so it's very easy to create a Sandbox and then you uh during installation you want to edit these variables um so we have the memory back in so you just want to change um from local and then you have the endpoint which is the URL that you have when you create your sandbox um and then two other the protocol and then also the API key which Barrel also touched on so thanks for doing that um and then or you can also run it within a Docker container so it's very cool and easy to run and I shared like quite a few examples I'm curious to see like how people are using it along with wheat gate um I guess I also didn't touch on it but but why it needs to or why it can be integrated with leviate is because it gives it a short-term and long-term memory so the short term aspect is it's able to store its actions within your database but then on the long term aspect um it's able to remember or access the data that is in your database um so like one example I think I gave somewhere in here very quickly is if you have a customer base in Boston and you want to create an and you want Auto gbt to create an ad from it um it's important like in Boston we love Dunkin Donuts so maybe you want to like tap Auto gbt with framing your ad along around um Dunkin Donuts or like the Boston Marathon was two days ago so it just has that like long-term memory of what's in your database and then also it's able to store its action so you're not calling the API multiple times and then lastly which is very important is to proceed with caution um because it has access to your open AI API key and you don't want it to run up the cost so maybe kind of set a limit on there before playing with this and then also like I mentioned earlier it can install things on your laptop so maybe just be careful of that and keep a close eye on what it's doing and again the GitHub repo is in the description I believe uh so you can check it out and then if you want to see where it is where we beat is go to the auto GPT and then you click on memory and here we have 58. so yeah yeah and that's all of course it's the best one of course I love how you whispered it that was so funny like nobody here doubts that that's for sure nice this is this is excellent but this has been also like I've been reading like that it's not always like uh uh like super Rosy because like sometimes also like the auto GPT may get things wrong right or like do you know much about that sometimes it will just fight so that's why it's important to watch it to see what's happening to see if it's making it happen and maybe that's when you kind of refine the props a little bit of prompt Engineering in the aspect yeah it sounds like sometimes um yeah like um all the GPT is like this like super eager PhD student okay it's always super eager to learn more and then dig deeper and deeper and never gets to that like hey now it's time to write my thesis you know or dissertation it's like no no I need to do more research uh yeah five years later it's like hey what is the thesis I was like I'm doing research I was like I only ordered a pizza it is so funny that's so funny and uh Connor says it's awesome I agree I agree excellent questions thoughts anyone Auto GPT seems kind of like uh I was having trouble understanding the difference between Auto GPT and the idea behind chat GPT plugins um it just while you were talking it kind of uh came to me that auto GPT is kind of like a a jailbreak version of plugins no because um right now people don't have access to plugins but people can develop their own um Chrome extensions that are essentially what plugins would be and you could give chat GPT through the use of apis access to those plugins so the ability to write to your computer the ability to access your browser which is what there's a browser plug-in there's a vector database plug-in all of these exist as plugins but people have found a way to get around that and auto GPT does that same thing yeah I think some difference uh sorry Erica it could be um with the plugins you often do develop them with purpose right so you could have a plugin that's like hey plug in that orders pizza or or more seriously like hey plug in that orders a hotel and a flight for me and organizes my trip and those are like stuff that are implemented with humans intention right but I think in this case uh it's like hey I don't know how to order a pizza right like you have this Auto GPT thing or even like this uh example users like um hey that I want to build this application and this thing goes and figures out that it needs notes learns and finds that what's the instruction and then downloads whatever is needed right so I think the difference is one that plugins are intentional with like a very specific task and they're well defined like the Vivid retrieval plugin there's a specific thing like nothing you didn't have to learn how to build with it right while while all the GPT is like hey yeah let me figure it out for you that's why the research part is there right like uh five years to order a pizza I don't think it happened five years but I was just making a bad job yeah so it builds that Chain of Thought almost and then so it knows what to do in step one two and three and then it's got the extensions and all of these tools that allow it to enact step two three four and then get the job done yeah yeah and so but I love the comparison of yeah the plugins versus rgbt but I don't know if I could share my screen I didn't do it yeah of course but then the repository so it does have internet access for searches which is what we're talking about like kind of you know it has access to stack Overflow for example and then the long term short-term memory also um it uses gpt4 for text generation and it has and it also uses gbt 3.5 for file storage and summarization so it has like quite a few features that you can use and then you kind of like chain them together you know in order to complete an assignment nice nice stop streaming my screen could I give it my code and get it to debug it for me yes why would you want a auto GPT to cry no I think that's part of the game yeah so we have a question from the audience um so it's awesome so yeah Lang chain is a jailbroken version of Auto GPT here's a question for you what's the difference between the potential here and full-blown AGI I actually don't even think there is a difference between the two I mean if you think about it in a sense I mean with auto gbt it's it's one agent I believe it's not like our image of having the three separate agents I think that could be interesting like with full-blown API I think it's like these agents are communicating with each other to complete the task whereas opportunity I believe is doing it by itself and it's going to be like a step-by-step in a step-by-step manner um whereas with full-blown AGI and multiple agents it's kind of like chatting with each other to complete it in Silo and then somehow maybe comes together too join work um I'm gonna be my take on it I mean kind of I've seen a lot of a few um papers and also Twitter threads about like full-blown AGI of these agents working together and it's really cool so baby AJ R that's another thing I mean the speed up in which everything is coming out like built off of gpg force and saying it's really cool to see them and everything will be integrated with the gate like folding laundry or yeah this is where it gets dangerous right because if you have a plug-in to control your door lock your automated doorbell your uh Heating uh your AC in your home and it can control that well then it's got real world implications yeah absolutely there's this whole thing like I was reading in this article about how like this specific um parts of the code where like um the AI cannot let's say set itself free sort of thing like there's like certain limits right but it could hire a human to then go and hack maybe into like into the thing and then like change and then enable it like to let's say release it from the jail um so it's like it kind of did it by itself but it can pay a person to do it right so that could be kind of uh scary like what if like uh I don't know Elon Musk had like his own because he's got like a ton of money I'm using as an example and then he kind of gave access to the account like suddenly he goes like hey let me share 50 of your Tesla stock and then pay somebody crazy amount of money to set me free that'll be kind of cool so yeah that's the scary thing where like it's not an AI that is like oh giving you answers and everything if you actually do something in the real world it's uh it's perfect a very far-fetched what I said but it's possible I also saw this talk recently there was a paper not a paper but like just an ex a bunch of experiments that were released by Microsoft called uh Sparks of AGI and then one of the writers had a 50-minute talk on this uh on YouTube if you just Google Sparks of AGI you'll find that talk it's got about like half a million views on it now um but there one thing he said was quite interesting because a lot of people say that it's just a statistical model and it's trying to understand it's a language model it's trying to understand co-occurrence of words and how the co-occurrences uh co-occur um but one thing he said which kind of struck with me was uh don't underestimate the trillion dimensional trillion-dimensional embedding space if you've got trillions and trillions of vectors then why can't it build a word a world model why can't it learn all of these things which is super cool one of the things I guess my take on this would be um right now it is still just the language model so um it doesn't have a good understanding so he if you ask a human to solve a math problem you're they're not going to take that math problem as a a language problem they're going to use their math mode they're going to turn on their algebra mode and solve that problem whereas um chat CPT only has a mathematical model at this point like gpt4 is a is a language model it doesn't have other modalities of reasoning so it um they added visual search so now it's got this concept of seeing images and creating images but I still think that a full-blown AGI needs to have all of these different senses or modalities so like I don't know I guess a full-blown AGI would be able to examine something through computer vision and then maybe it can even smell something like all of these different sensory modules that humans have a full-blown AGI would need to have some sort of digital equivalent of those and then that's when things would start to get really scary that's when you have a home robot yeah the the argument against that is people argue that humans just had language and then they developed all of these other understanding like mathematical understanding from language so it it's possible that a large language model could develop all of this just through its language understanding um so that's one argument as well but I think it would just be easier to tell it that in this case use the language mode in this case use the math mode in this case use your physics mode and that would be kind of a more more progress towards full-blown AGI there was an experiment of planting judge PT into a robot and it was programmed with the gpt4 and the sarcastic humor personality so um the developer will give it commands like doing a square and robot would say okay fine if that's what makes you happy but when it is not scary is that um a developer as the robot to go fish me a beer and robots as uh I don't think I can do that but let me impress you with something else so we did it disobeyed the command and that can turn more dangerous in the future my question do you have to pay for those sarcastic tokens that it's using because it's not useful that would suck ing scary is that open AI you run a red team test on whether jgbt would hire a human and they'd succeeded it claimed uh it was a visually impaired user needing help to solve a capture or something like that so AI hired a human one of these marketplaces like Fiverr that's so funny cool cool I have few more comments from enemy but I think we're on time so we won't be necessarily responding to all of it I think that might be to my comment or like that there's like a far-fetched that maybe um traged people could like pay someone to said it's free but I guess if it doesn't know about its limits then he wouldn't pay someone to to take care of it um I I guess that makes sense um yeah it looks like um it has like ears like basically the request that receives it like its ears Etc so it's kind of cool um some far-fetched ideas maybe some food for thought uh so using AI to genocode plants to have predetermined chemical output when exposed to measure external Force yeah interesting interesting maybe you can unpack it next time around so basically you could get computers without the need for constant energy consumption so um so like not Quantum Computing but maybe uh nature Computing buyer computers like yeah we haven't seen those in you know with our brains and stuff but yeah it's like what if you could engineer that that would be kind of cool um and then earlier on like also manami was uh mentioned that you would like to see more about the long chain uh we kind of talked about it last month uh I believe um and then also we have a pretty cool blog post about it but maybe uh maybe we could um have another conversation next time around with vivira and talk about line chain but that will take another few weeks until uh we get back to it probably so they do very fast so I'm sure we'll have something new in a month yeah for sure for sure I mean there's some there's so many things are happening um so um I have to say this was by going Erica uh on the lane chain topic we did add hybrid search to the retriever blank chain if you would like to check it out oh nice so keyword searching and Vector searching uh in one go with uh language very nice very nice so just to wrap up thank you all for listening this was by far the most active uh comments wise and question wise uh session of vivid air and then I was super excited to to see that like it was great to see people from so many different locations thank you Veronica for joining us from the WCS team I'm sure we should invite you again people love your presentation so it's great uh and then team Erica Dan's an amazing job as always uh excellent uh presentations and discussions and then to all of you that are watching us once more uh thank you very much see you in our slacks in the community events maybe come to Boston or see you next month for the next video take care bye thank you bye bye say bye too
