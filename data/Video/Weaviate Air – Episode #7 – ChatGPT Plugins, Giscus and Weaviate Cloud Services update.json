{"text": "Planned topics: * ChatGPT Plugins and Weaviate * What is new in Weaviate Cloud Services * Giscus \u2013 feedback/discussions ... \nforeign \n[Music] \nthis is episode 7 so uh it's a lucky \nseven lucky for you because we have a \nspecial guest in the studio with us it's \na in a studio well it's like well in the \nair somewhere we have Veronica from the \nmovie cloud services team which is \namazing and the usual suspect from the \ndevil team Dan Erica and Zen so uh hello \neveryone and I also brought in just for \ntoday's call these two guys so these are \nmy meerkats the skinny guy is also a \nmeerkat by the way it was a gift that \ndown brought from South Africa which is \nkind of cool so it's a really really \ncool so thank you for watching thank you \nfor listening uh we really really \nappreciate your time that you spend with \nus so so it's really really good \num if you want to help this this channel \nuh give the video a like whether you \nwatch it live or later on you know like \ntime is is an interesting concept right \nlike this is happening live and yet you \nwill be able to watch it years from now \nwhich is really cool \num and then the best thing about \nactually being live is the ability to \nask questions so please feel free to ask \nquestions as we go I'll try to monitor \nthe questions sometimes people answer \nthem like uh directly on the YouTube \nchannel uh but but we'll also try to \naddress them and then I'll share them \nwith everybody else \nso that's it about like the the usual uh \nintro and then we have four topics that \nwe would like to cover today so the \nfirst topic that we will talk about is \ndiscuss or actually how can you share \nyour feedback with us directly on the \nVBA website which is really cool so Dan \nwill talk to you about that \num the next thing that we have and \nthat's why we have Veronica here is \nwhat's new in the Vivid cloud services \nlike you maybe you'll get some secrets \nfrom one of the engineers that was \nbuilding it so this is really cool no \npressure Vera is going to be great for \nsure \num there's also a lot of things \nhappening oh this is a new graphic that \nwe have uh a lot of things happening \naround like the charge EPT retrieval \nplugins and then there is our plugins in \ngeneral so then we'll talk to you about \nthe the plugin that works with vv8 I'm \nsure he'll be able to explain it way \nbetter than I do uh and then finally \nlast but not least \nthere's been so much excitement around \nAuto GPT and then actually you can use \nAuto GPT with Vivid and Erica is going \nto cover that for us and of course we \nall have a nice chat about it and then \nhave some questions so feel free to drop \nquestions and also as a second things \nlike just drop us a message just for \nwarm up say hey where are you watching \nfrom you know like or like is this the \nfirst episode that you're watching I is \nthis like a second or a third Heck if \nyou saw all seven I'll send you a \nt-shirt like you can lie I will not have \na way to to test but the first person to \nsay maybe you'll get a t-shirt you know \nand um Erica yeah you know the first \ncomment yeah thanks for joining uh you \nalready have a t-shirt so that would be \ncheating but um maybe I'll send you one \nspecial I pretended all seven so you \nattended all seven right like you're a \nreal Pro \num so really really great so that's it \nfor the warm up let's dive into \num discuss so done what can you tell us \nabout it because like you worked on it \num and uh it's actually pretty cool \nproject and um I feel like people really \nenjoy learning about it \nyes hi everyone \num so viscous is a commenting widget and \nthe motivation was to give developers an \neasy way to interact with our \ndocumentation to give us a thumbs up or \nsome feedback or else qualification \nquestions and so far the way you do that \nyou'd have to go to GitHub find our \nproject not find an issue but let's say \nyou read the blog post and I have a \nquestion about Auto GPT you can simply \ntype it in this \ncomment widget down here you don't have \nto go to GitHub you don't have to find \nthe correct product it's right there \nso um these comments pertain to the blog \nor to our documentation for instance \nlet's say \nyou want to check out the new embedded \nleviate feature that we launched \nrecently and do I read a documentation \nyou realize that we don't talk about \nmodules \nso you can leave a comment something \nlike what modules are enabled by default \nand I log into GitHub so I see this \ncomment button if you are commenting for \nthe first time you're going to see a \nbutton to sign in with GitHub once you \nauthorize that your comment will post \nand uh comments end up in the ev8 Io Io \nrepo in the discussion tab \nand I've refreshed the page and you see \nit here there was a document on \npage \nand um everything is done through GitHub \nso your identity will be preserved there \nyou can see this was my username and \nthis is a comment I left \nand if you simply want to express your \nappreciation for the fantastic job that \nwe've been doing on this you can also \ngive us a heart or even say that the \npage rocks \nand that will also be reflected right \nhere on \nand the GitHub discussion \nso the way we built this was initially \nwe looked at \num popular commenting widgets one of \nthem was discuss \nthey all love this sport mantle between \ndiscussion and something \num but this has \nthis class was not open source and uh it \nalso tracks users so we looked at open \nsource options and found \nthis cast which is um \nproject that is building a common system \npowered by GitHub discussions \nwhat we saw earlier \nso um \nthis has advantage that it's all open \nsource and it's stored on GitHub along \nwith uh our code and the issues you can \nlink to each numbers and you can create \na new shot of a discussion so we are \ngoing to do that when we triage comments \nand it's easy to export anything if we \never want to move to a different system \nin the future thanks to the GitHub apis \nand it's a really useful discussion \nsystem that you may be interested in \nadopting for your own open source \nproject \npretty easy to get started with we made \na few customization to have um both the \nname here and the path because sometimes \nthe name can be ambiguous like \ninstallation but the path is ambiguated \nbut essentially it was a pretty story \nfor integration \nso yeah we welcome your comments on both \nblog posts or the documentation just \nscroll to the bottom and \ngive us some nice emojis or some \nconstructive feedback \nexcellent excellent \num I mean it's always like I love like \nwhen you're like yeah give us feedback \nbut not just feedback make it \nconstructive right like uh be nice about \nit like even if something is uh you know \nneeds a bit of change and help like uh \nbe constructive but I'll definitely \nencourage everyone else to kind of like \ncheck it out \num and and also I know and I think Dan \nis about to show it for every blog post \nthat we have uh we also have discussions \nat the bottom so if you read one of the \nblog posts or all of them like uh like \nyou should \num and you find it interesting or you \nhave like some question follow follow-up \nquestions uh that could be a pretty cool \nplace to do that and the latest blog was \nalready got some likes Etc so that's \nreally really cool to uh actually I \nlet's see who these people were \nyeah John yeah so like yeah let's let's \nget some emojis and uh from from the \ncommunity like is uh right now there's \n15 people I can see watching so uh why \nnot right I'm curious \num and maybe I can stop sharing your \nscreen for now \num how long did you take to implement \nthat like what was like um from the \nmoment you knew it's going to be discuss \nlike how long did you take for that \num in terms of absolute hours \nI don't know something like four I would \nsay but it was much more difficult to do \nthe market research for this and um \nsee what implications discuss has versus \ndiscuss \nso I would say four plus a few more for \ntesting and debugging and um there are a \nfew points that don't work that well if \nyou only leave an emoji we still say \ndocumentation comment on that page \nthere's actually there's no comment to \nadjust the Emojis so I I've been trying \nto tweak that but I don't have a good \nsolution so far \nwe might have in the future something \nlike reactions on the post as opposed to \ncomments on it \nnice nice but this is the thing right \nlike if uh people in the audience see \nthis and like we've already done the \nresearch and if you like what what you \nhave like uh yeah you could you could \nget it done in like half a day maybe a \nday that's pretty impressive time yeah \nthat it takes to integrate this the \noffers we did an internal testing and so \nhow we graduated and all that but \num now that you know it's uh \nit's a good widget to adopt you can do \nit much faster than we did \nexcellent I think I think for me what \nthis improves a lot is the workflow on \nfeedback for uh blogs and documentation \nso after I wrote that um chat TPT plugin \nblog I got emails Twitter responses \npeople reached out on the slack channel \nso there's like \na thousand different channels that you \ncan ask questions but the most relevant \none now would just be discus because I \nwould be following that and we can have \na conversation there you can of course \nemail me and reach out to me through \nwhatever Channel but this would be I \nwould be watching out for questions \nthere so my response rate would be very \nhigh on giskus so now we have like one \nCentral channel for questions feedback \neverything related to a blog post \nyou uh people in the comments right \nso you can do that if I want to share \nthe screen I cannot show how that works \nif you know that on GitHub but um \nso in here you are in GitHub discussions \nand you can say Sebastian please answer \nthis \num \nbut \nin here there's no Auto completion \nand that's the last limitation of the \nplugin so to expand a bit more on the \nimplementation uh this is uh the web \ncomponent and then there is a gizkas \nor react \ncomponent that we used \nand that made it easier to implement \nonce \nwe found out about it \nand the bulk of the work so I didn't \ninclude this in the four hours the book \nwas to actually go through each page of \nour site and make sure the footer had a \nreference to this widget because we have \ndifferent types of blog posts and \ndifferent Footers some of them are \ncalled to action hey us vv8 others are \nstay in touch depends on the context so \num \nis not impossible that most of the work \nwould be actually to just place the \nwidget in your footer if that's not a \nuniform piece of content \nnice nice \ncool no question so now it's a shout out \ntime so you know at the beginning I \nasked our audience like where people are \nwatching uh from and uh so we have Brent \nfrom Canada \nOttawa so uh Zen maybe not not too far \noff although Canada is so huge that's \nprobably far far enough \num then you have deep we have deep from \nLondon uh we have Sila from Netherlands \nuh then you already hand waving and then \nwe have virenda from in Indiana USA and \nthen we have Marco from Milan so uh \nwelcome everyone to Vivid air we are \nsuper happy to have you here and uh \nhopefully just this shout out alone was \nenough hey and we have someone from \nLisbon Portugal ottman \num FYI Portugal is my one of my favorite \ncountries in Europe uh so like \ndefinitely uh excited to see somebody \nfrom Lisbon and uh any excuse to go \nthere by the way it's it's a good thing \nfor me so maybe I should go and meet \nottman that would be cool \num \nI'm trying to hide the banner but it's \nnot hiding maybe he's just not showing \nfor me there we go as a delay all right \nso perfect so that's \nuh now we have Veronica that will talk \nto us about WCS Vera should I share your \nscreen yes please \nall right so all right \nso I'm already logged in this is our new \nWCS we launched it around three weeks \nago \nso what I prepared for you today is the \nsandbox which is the free sandbox it's a \nfree cluster \nand you you have 14 days to use that \nand you can see here some details like \nURL the Vivid version \ninformation about API keys and \nexpiration date etc etc \nthe next two are about their paid \nclusters with the standard plan so one \nwhich I prepared for you is the one with \nthe lower wee bit version about that in \na second or maybe we will go through it \nright now because we need couple of \nminutes \nto wait for the update so here \num \nlet's say that we get deployed cool new \nfeatures and I really really would like \nto use them \nso we prepared the solution that is just \none click now and you have to provide \nthe cluster name \nand thus click confirm what is happening \nnow we have heard here the notification \nthat it's starting and here you go you \ncannot delete the cluster because it's \nin a progression State on or query it \nbecause this is the version without the \nhigh availability and after a couple of \nminutes you will see that the Vivid \nversion is the \nnewest one and while we are talking \nabout that the newest version is 118.3 \nand it enables some cool features for \nour users about that in a second \num hey Vera this is amazing this this is \nactually amazing because like sometimes \nuh like especially when we have like a \nnew release of weaviate right and uh I \nalways kind of go like uh yeah like but \nI really want to straight up like start \nusing this and then sometimes in the \npast I'll just go like hey I'll create a \nnew version and then migrate my data \nover but now I can just click the button \nwait for a few minutes and then I can \nstart using whatever is latest and \ngreatest so this is amazing I don't know \nwe could do that \nexactly just like that one click and the \nother so the magic is happening \nunderneath we are already 50 so that's \nwhy we are slowly move to the next Topic \nin the meantime which is the eight like \nis management \nso lots of users they were \num they requesting \nthat it would be really great if we have \nsome API keys to have access to the \ncluster of course this is a great idea \nbecause \nbased on this example for for example I \ncan tell you that this is the sandbox so \nthe free cluster and I during the \ncreation so let's go maybe just to \ncreate a cluster so I picked a free \nsandbox and this is the uh the \nauthentication is enabled by default \nwhich is always great to have one \num \nso let's go back because I wanted just \nto show you that we have such option \noh and we have to take a pause because \nlike you can see the Vivid version \nupdate is already done it was quicker \nthan I thought so that's that's nice wow \nthat was so easy yeah it's so easy and \nand fast I I thought that I have more \ntime \nso we have already here the newest \nversion and uh we can just use our \ncluster and query it and fit with with \nnew cool data so once we go to the \nsandbox which is the API Keys management \nwe can see that I enabled the \nauthentication during the when I was \nclicking on the form and by clicking on \na key I see oh okay I can see I have my \nAPI keys I have the admin okay I can see \nthe example header which I can copy and \nuse that for example I would like to \nshare my cluster with with Joe Sebastian \nand but I don't want to give you my \ncredentials to WCS so now you can query \nthe the cluster because I will share \nwith you the URL of the cluster and the \nAPI key and we will go there in two \nminutes because there is more about API \nkeys so now we released a couple of days \nago the the new cool feature which is \nthe managed API Keys it means you can \nadd or remove existing Keys it's also \nreally easy so let's go and add a new \nAPI key could be read only so on the \naccess to read the data or full admin \naccess we can go maybe with them with \nonly one generate \nand we can see that the process started \nit's already in progress it takes couple \nof minutes \nand while talking about that let's go to \nthe another cluster and maybe just to \nremove some keys because \nI don't want to use this key anymore \nbecause I think that this is not in \nusage and it's better to have always \nonly the the keys we are using \nand that's it it's already removed and \nto for those two clusters action is in \nprogress of course it takes a couple of \nminutes again \nbut you can do it you know on your own \nyou don't have to ask anyone you don't \nhave to find anything this is just a \nclick and it's easy and I think it's \nreally fast and will be helpful for our \nusers oh we have 50 already all right \nnice \nyeah hey so I have a question or in a \ncomment right so first of all I think \nyou'll be one of the first people that \nwould want uh ability to delete the keys \nbecause like right now like let's say \nyou compromise your clusters because you \nshare the cloud the keys with the world \nexactly like they're all 700 people that \nare watching us live that's a real \nnumber uh I'm not going to be copying \ntrying to hacking into our environment \nand that's kind of uh really useful \nright because yes by mistake you \ncommitted your key to GitHub repo or you \nshowed it on a super popular Vivid air \nuh you could just delete it and then \nlike nobody can get access to it \num but I also really love the ability to \nsplit the read and write keys because \nlet's say if for backend operations you \nhave the right key for uh mod for \nmodifying the data Etc but if you want \nto build a website then later on that \nuses WIBI to search you should only ever \nuse read key right yes so that's really \nreally cool yeah I'm very excited about \nish and uh I already used the keys \nbefore but I didn't know that you could \nactually change the keys and generate \nnew ones that's really cool \nyeah that's our the newest feature so \nlet's see what we've got here so yeah we \nhave one more key uh already added to \nour cluster and here I was removing one \nright so I don't know if it's yeah I \nremoved one of the read-only keys and \nit's removed but the operation is not \nfinished yet but no problem it will be \ndone a couple of minutes uh of course I \nwill remove all data I prefer for you \nguys today this is of course the the \nthing I don't want to pay for all of \nthose clusters \nI mean waves cheap you know yeah I know \nI know right \num very good price all right \nso one more thing maybe let's um because \nI know that we have lots of users that \nthey have already clusters which are \ndeployed not by us but they are \nsomewhere in a cool place so \nyou can add this cluster here in \nexternal clusters section \nand just query it in the query module so \nas a test \nlet's \ntype data \nexcept for example cluster and I have \nprepared of course something for you \nso the URL save and doing that we can go \nto the query module and as a locked in \nuser I can see all clusters so the \nmanage clusters and the sandboxes \nand I can easily query them so this is \nthe one I prepared with with data \nexactly yeah okay so the query cannot be \nempty of course so let's go there and \nsee what we have there are some for sure \npretty basic example but I would like to \nshow you that that it's working and so \nI'm a login custom user here so we can \nsee that yeah okay I can access the data \neverything is fine but in a case we were \ndiscussing before \nso what in the case that I would like to \nsomeone would like to see the data but \nnot change the data of course and I \ndon't want to share my credentials to \nWCS so let's just log out and we can see \nthe start screen \nso let's go there and use the same \ncluster we were querying now \nso I'm pretending I'm the different \nperson the new team member so I have to \nface the cluster URL and \nSebastian \nof course name \nor one cluster \nand click connect we are in a \nwe are in a query module so here in the \nbeginning we didn't support text and a \ncluster querying but now we are so we \nhave two options because you can be \nlogged in and just class query your \ncluster or you can do the thing we were \ndiscussing before so now we can see we \nare unauthorized right because I'm \nlogged out and I didn't use the \nauthorization header so now let's go and \njust add it and this is the same cluster \nI was using when I was logged in \nso we need the key organization \nnow let's \npaste the read-only key API key \nwhich is like that click again and like \nyou can see again I have a I have an \naccess to the cluster and I can query \nthis is so amazing um Erica was actually \nclapping she was so excited this is so \nawesome \nwow \nso that would be it from my side what I \nwanted to show you today and thank you \nperfect this is a great uh presentation \nanybody else have questions before I ask \nsome more \nmaybe from the audience as well but \nthey're in here I don't have a question \nbut I was talking to um so there was a \nsomeone new to Evie who was interested \nin this and all I did was send them a \nlink to WCS and the next email I had \nwith them was how do I upload documents \nto my webia cluster like the whole \nprocess is so seamless and \nstraightforward that I didn't have \nmultiple interactions oh this is not \nworking how do I do this it was \nliterally send them a link and then they \nwant to see how I can how they can \nupload documents to it from that point \non so this is great \nnice nice and we have a nice comment \nfrom Brent thank you Brent \num yeah \nVera if you are on the free tier can you \nalso update your instance even though I \nmean I guess \nlike if you're creating a cluster around \nthe same time that there's a release \nno no \num for now we don't have a feature for \nsandbox to be updated uh but when there \nis a plan to have one we'll have one but \nas I know now there is no uh plans for \nthat and sandboxes are now only valid \nfor 14 days so maybe maybe that's that's \nthe reason as well so yeah there \nshouldn't be too many version changes \nright in those 14 days \nmight have a different idea but yeah \nsure um \nand then also since our ctOS here he's \ndropped the comment \num like yeah it's actually he's so right \njust a few months ago it was a bunch of \nmock-ups like we had like the old WCS \nbut the new one it's so great to see \nthen and I agree with it at the end \namazing demo Vera I know you are a bit \nnervous before but like hey yeah yeah no \nreasons to be nervous whatsoever you did \ngreat \num thank you questions anyone else \nsorry Dan you go \nI had another question about the free \ntier like America \num the uh API key that's only available \nfor those it's not available for the \nfree tier right \nyes it is there is one one key available \nI think this is the admin one but we \ncannot wait we cannot change it or you \nknow delete or add a new one for now for \nthe free cluster let's just take a look \nyeah you you have just the one default \none during the creation process right \nthere's no read only here okay there \nyes \nwow you should upgrade anybody who wants \na read only key \nif there is a needs the rule we read \nonly read on Nikki \nanother ways like share your feedback \nwith us right and tell us so that would \ndefinitely definitely work \num just before you I give you the floor \nto Erica we have another comment very \nimpressive from Brad's thanks Brad \nthank you keep the comments uh coming \neveryone that's great \nalso there will be a tutorial and blog \nposts on authorization so \num Vera touched on it um and she showed \nall the corner capabilities but next \nweek we'll be releasing something that \ncan also help further help the community \nusers \nyeah and about that maybe you can \nalready \num say that the future about the \nupdating cluster is pretty neat because \nwith the version \n1183 you can use the open AI \num \nAPI key in the query module so because \nwe wait accepts that so I think that \nit's really great information for our \nusers \nI have another question from the \ncommunity but I'm not sure if that's \nlike a for us to handle maybe something \nI mean does anyone know here or maybe \nsomething at the end could help with do \nwe know is there a plan to download \nmodels like with the self-hosted docker \nor \nokay it's for instance to get clip \nthe only thing that's part of what we \nare supposed to do with WCS right \nyeah \nyeah maybe we should go pray to the \nmighty Etienne who's watching the \nsession maybe respond on the comments \nbecause I don't think any of us know the \nanswer to that \num right \nquestion from Brad is the cloud service \nrunning on AWS \nall right so our service is running on \nGoogle Cloud but if we are talking about \nclusters it's coming soon so you can \ndeploy then your cluster \nin the WCS or or in a AWS I'm sorry or \nGoogle cloud or maybe in the future for \nsure in the future Azure cloud and based \non that there will be more and more \nconfiguration that it's that the user \ngets really the you know the the cluster \nif he or she needs \nperfect and I also know like in between \nlike a self-hosted and like using WCS we \nare we also have like uh the hybrid \nmodel so if you have like your own like \na set of private VPN or other clusters \nand then you won't reviate uh like \nconnect with Vivid cloud services we can \noffer that so we can help help with \nestablishing it and then do the whole \nlike hosting uh within your own \nenvironment so that's like also like it \ncould be very useful for like government \norganizations maybe where you go like \nhey this has to exist on our uh clouds \nuh and then you can't go anywhere else \nso that's definitely an option \nyeah and uh to your uh response this \ncloud service will be an easy sell for \nme now \nwe are glad we converted you Brad thank \nyou \nperfect any final comments before we \nmove on to Zen \nall right no comments so thank you Vera \nand there may be some questions later we \ncould always come back to you uh but now \nuh let's uh talk business with Zen \nthen what do you have for us \nyeah so maybe I can so I'll show this a \nlittle bit later but what I wanted to \ntalk about was the uh chat GPT retrieval \nplugin \num and so people are going crazy about \nchat GPT and how you can get it to well \nhow you can get it to do things that it \ncan't do properly right now so one of \nthe uh issues is that it doesn't handle \nmathematical problems well first of all \nbecause it's language and it doesn't \nunderstand \num math appropriately so with the \nrelease of plugins you could give it a \nmath mode so like Wolfram Alpha could be \nthe math mode for chat GPT and that's \nenabled through a plugin \nto to Wolfram Alpha \num and then we wrote a blog post around \nthis that uh that will post in the um in \nthe uh in the description but this is \nwhat the blog post was uh I wanted to \ncover one particular plugin uh which is \nthe one that we developed for uh for \nchat GPT and essentially how this plugin \nworks is quite similar to our generative \nsearch functionality \num except now what happens is let's say \nyou have we V8 and you've got a bunch of \nyour own documents these can be anything \nfrom your own textbooks if you're a \nstudent you want to conduct search over \nyour textbooks and you want chat cpg to \nanswer questions with respect to those \ntextbooks or it can be your own like \npersonal company document it can be your \nentire Enterprise your policy your HR \ndocuments \nyou can put them into Eva and \nessentially how the retrieval plug-in uh \nworks for chat GPT is you would just go \nto chat CPT as regular to their website \nyou would enable the plugin and then you \nsend you submit a prompt to chat TPT and \nusually what would happen is if you ask \na question about \num what days do I get off or how many uh \nhow many work from home days do I get \nchat CPT would say I have no uh \ninformation about your particular \nscenario right \num but now what it does instead is it \nrealizes that I have a connected Vector \ndatabase so I have this sort of memory \nor this uh store of relevant information \nthat I should go look at before I tell \nyou I don't have any information so it's \na way to in the short term augment the \nmemory of a a large language model with \nanything that you find relevant enough \nto put into the vector database \nso basically what it will do is before \nit tells you yeah I don't know if you \ngive it a very specific prompt it'll \nquery the vector database and then the \nvector database comes back with a \nrelevant document so it conducts the \nsearch and it sends the document to \nChachi PT and then it reads through it \nand if it finds an answer to your prompt \nit'll it'll send you a customized \nresponse and so this is super cool \nbecause now \nsimilar to the generative search \nfunctionality you can just go into chat \nGPT well not now but when you have \naccess to this so right now this is an \nalpha very few limited people have \naccess to this but when you do get \naccess to it eventually you can go to \nchatgpt and I can actually show that \ncomponent of this \nso here \nyou could go here and then you won't \nhave access to this right now so it's in \nAlpha but you could go down here and \nthen you would be able to see the uh V8 \nretrieval plug-in here you could simply \ninstall it so these are the only few \nthat are kind of officially accepted at \nthis point \nbut we're in the process of going \nthrough this as well so you would \ninstall it and then now you could ask a \nquestion and then it would work on your \nuh your own uh document I can show a \nvideo of this actually as well over here \nso this is a video that Sebastian \nrecorded where here \nhe's going in \nyeah so that's what the retrieval plugin \nlooks like \nand so this is a question that only the \nvector database has information about \nchat tpd doesn't know about so you can \nsee that it uses the retrieval plug-in \nhere and then you can ask it further \nquestions \nthe interesting thing here that I want \nto point out let me Zoom back up for a \nsecond notice what it does here \nokay so you ask it a question \nand then \nit uses the plugin and then it uses the \nplugin again that's an interesting thing \nthat I want to talk about a little bit \nlater on but I'll let this whole thing \ncomplete out \nyou can have a follow-up conversation \nwith it \nso when we created this video uh chat \nGPT could query leviate to get \ninformation that it thought was relevant \nto answering a question \nso \nthe \nwhat what we have now which is version \n2. version 2 is that you can actually go \nand insert documents through a query \nthrough writing a prompt and then also \ndelete documents through writing a \nprompt so in this blog post I mentioned \nthat this would be super cool because \nyou could tell chat TPT something and \nyou could ask it to remember it for next \ntime or put a store into its Vector \ndatabase memory \nand instead of calling the query \nendpoint as is shown here it would just \ncall the upsert endpoint and it would \nactually insert objects into Eva you can \nalso call the delete endpoint by telling \nit to forget something forget a \nparticular document or forget that you \ntold it a particular detail and that \nwould call the delete endpoint and it \nwould remove objects from leviate so \nit's a \nyou're basically upserting querying \ndeleting things just by talking to chat \nGPT which is which is pretty scary but \nit's also super cool as well \nthat's really cool for the example that \nyou gave of like company policy \ndocuments it's like what if it changes \nyeah and you kind of need to update that \nand that's cool that we could just do \nthat Within \nyeah you don't even have to go to \nalleviate to do that you don't have to \nlike call at a particular endpoint you \ncan ask chatgpt to call the endpoint for \nyou \num digging further into that question \nthe super interesting thing with chat \nGPT and plugins is that you would think \nthat they you have you tell it how to \ncall the query endpoint or how to query \nthe vector database \nbut that's not actually true when you uh \nwhen you create the plugin which if \nanybody's interested you can actually \nsee the code for the weeviate retrieval \nplugin over here \nbut when you create the uh the plugin \nyou have to create a manifest and in \nthat manifest you have to tell uh chat \nGPT what the endpoints you're exposing \nare and you have to describe them so for \nour endpoints we have the query endpoint \nwhich has a description of retrieve \nobjects from your alleviate Vector \ndatabase there's an absurd delete \nthere's all sorts of endpoints there we \njust describe them uh we never actually \ntell chat epd the syntax with which to \nuse those endpoints so it doesn't really \nknow how to query but it uses your code \nand your description of the code so your \ncomments to understand how it should \nquery V8 and how I realized this was so \nif I go back to this video \nyou see here \nyou see how it tried it first and it \ndidn't work this is because it's \nlearning how to query the database in \nreal time so it failed the first time \nand then it realized okay let me try a \ndifferent way and then it realized how \nto query the database and then from that \npoint on every time you query so now if \nyou ask it another question and if I let \nit run you see how it works on the first \ntry it's because it it made a mistake it \nlearned how to query it and then every \ntime from that point on it just uses the \nsame syntax to query so that's something \nsuper cool that is not apparent in the \nuh in the kind of the face of the blog \nor the video itself \num but you you can actually communicate \nit how to use your plugin and it will \nuse it accordingly which I thought was \nwas super interesting \nyeah and if you if you jump straight to \nthe end because that'll be a Shameless \nplug by the way uh if you go like way \nway to the end like you could probably \njust uh jump there \num until we we have the like the final \nanswer so yeah post here so FYI this \nthis actually is factually correct we \nare looking for developer Advocates uh \nto to join with it so uh this is not \nmade up like this is one of the roles \nwe're hiring so anyone that would like \nto join that you know this thing here \num hey we're looking for people so \nalways always cool \num I also thought like of this and by \nthe way like uh one uh thing like a \nnon-excite big excuse but uh normally \nwould show you this life uh the thing \nwill happen is we like to leave \ndangerously so we're updating the plugin \nand then sort of broke it a little bit \nso that's why we're not showing it live \nlive because basically right now if you \nask questions uh charge if you just like \nuh gives us an error because we broke \nthe the current version of the test \nplugin yeah but that's okay there's a \ngood reason actually because I mentioned \nhere uh before in version 1.0 we only \nhave the query endpoint that was exposed \nto chat TPT now we have delete and \num and insert or the upstairs endpoint \nso you can add it you can get it to \nremember and forget things so um we'll \nhave a blog post on that coming out soon \nso yeah look forward to that \nand we have a question a couple of \nquestions so does charge GPD store data \nfrom your documents via the plugin \nuh by by store data do you mean update \nthe yeah so let me interpret this I'm \nassuming here you mean it can store new \ninformation into the vector database via \nthe plugin and the answer is yes so the \nend point here instead of using query it \nwould use a separate endpoint called the \nupsert endpoint and you would tell it \nlet's say that you've told it that uh \nyou work for Wi-Fi and vva is looking \nfor a developer Advocate role if you \nwant to tell it the developer Advocate \nrole is based out of San Francisco or \nbased out of Silicon Valley remember \nthis for me it will actually absurd it \ninto alleviate for you that's the super \ncool thing with version two that were \nthat we're working on right now \nyeah but but also by the way like as you \nsee on um like on the diagram there's a \nvv8 instance itself you also also this \nis a vivid instance like that with all \nthe functionality that you would expect \nso usually the process will be like hey \nif you have 10 000 documents that you \nwant to drop in you'd use the usual way \nright like just just insert the data \ninto vv8 and then chart GPT will be able \nto query the database to get its answers \nright but I think this addition is also \ngoing like hey not only can I do it by \nAPI uh like Zen was explained like you \ncould do it through uh yeah telling \nchart GPT out this object \num so cool I think we all need access \nnow \nwell well here's the fun part and then \nwe are planning so there is this \nconference odsc East which is in Boston \nuh I think it's like 9 to 11 of May and \nthere's going to be a hackathon that \nwill be working with charging PD plugins \nand weaviate and uh I think the idea is \nto have like 10 teams in there \num and then the the every team will get \naccess to the chargerpd plugins so um \nyou know that could be one way to get \naccess like LED access \num maybe I can share the link to the \nhackathon a bit later \num we have another question uh so from \nBrent so the Manifest addresses the \ncontent of allowing editing deleting of \ncertain classes \nyeah so you right now you would have to \nspecify where to add let's say you have \nmultiple classes you would have to \nspecify which class to add it into \num and so the Manifest has that \nparticular syntax but in your in your \ntalk with chai TPT you would have to \nspecify those details as well \nnice nice and uh we get some \nencouragement now so like uh hey we all \nbreak code half the time \num that is so true that is so true \num although when I was younger and now I \nthought I was like I'm such a great \nengineer like I never write tests I just \nwrite good code I'm such a like \nI was so full of I don't want to say \nwhat \nbut yes we've all done that many times \nin our lives so it's cool and then \nanother word of a question from manami \nuh please continue open source effort \nyou're doing the entire world of favor \num that's so nice thank you Monami \ncool \nany more questions ideas \noh one more thing I guess um \nso a lot of people were super interested \nin plugins so right now we're looking at \nhow um kind of showing you the story \nunderneath how we created this plugin \nand the reason why we want to do that is \nso that because the process is quite \nGeneral if you wanted to create a \nplug-in once you did get access you \nwould go through similar steps you would \njust have different endpoints and you \nwould describe to chat GPT how to use \nthose endpoints so if you had let's say \na a Pizza Hut endpoint and you wanted to \norder from Pizza Hut specifically you \nwould describe the endpoints differently \nand everything else would be quite \nsimilar so you could you could uh you \nknow create your own endpoint and you \ncan tell that I'm hungry \nfrom my example \nI can always tell when you're hungry \nthat's fine I don't I don't I don't need \nAI for it \num cool and then I have one more \nquestion from FS \nhow can I add documents as charge GPT \nuser to the database \nyeah so you would at first there's uh \ntwo ways you could just hook up to your \nweeviate instance and as Sebastian says \nuh upload the documents \num as as you would regularly so that \nwould be in not through chat GPT so you \nwould just insert documents here so that \nyour instance knew about them the second \nway is uh you could tell chat CPT to \nupsert a document or to remember a \ndocument and it would call the upsert \nendpoint so this is version 1.0 in the \nflow chart but in version 2.0 there will \nbe another endpoint that it can call and \nit can insert documents one at a time \nfor you \num so the difference there would be like \nSebastian said if you're inserting ten \nthousand a hundred thousand a million \nobjects you wouldn't tell chat CPD to \ninsert it one by one you would actually \nhave to go through Eva and then batch \nthem and loop through it and uh insert \nit that would be much more efficient but \nif you're having a chat with chat GPT \nand you you say here's a new detail \ninsert it that would be a much more \neasier way to upsert through touching \nyeah I think the upsetting through \ncharge GPT to where I could see is like \nlet's say uh like we showed this example \nthat the the company policies and the \nroles and then like yes see our uh \npeople and culture person she could all \nhey the policy now changed now we have \nadditional benefits so she could kind of \ngo like HR GPD now the benefits for the \ncompanies are blah blah blah and then I \nthink that could be like a really good \nuse case but yeah in general like yeah \nthere'll be a lot of copy pasting if you \nwant to use the main chart GPD as like \nthe way to insert uh not to say \nexpensive because also I think that \nevery interaction there's some sort of \nclicks and tokens that are involved so \num for efficiency I would say like of \nlike uploading loads of documents just \ngo straight to vb8 \num we'll like the database is so \nefficient at it and really good at it \nlike that's probably the best way in \nperfect this is this is great I love I \nlove the conversation and everything \nlike Vera what do you think exciting \nstuff \nwould you use that \nyes lots of new knowledge for me in that \narea So the plan is that probably I will \nstart you know using it or learning more \nabout that \nnice nice yeah it's always cool to come \nand learn here so I'm so happy you're \nhere that's so cool \nOkay so \nlike I mentioned earlier \num Erica's already getting excited so \ntell us what do you have for us Erica \nall right I'll be covering Auto GPT and \nhow you can use with bb8 if you wouldn't \nmind sharing my screen I don't mind at \nall \nSo Yesterday JP and I released a blog \npost on auto TPT and how you can use it \nwith vv8 \num I want to touch on this image here I \nreally love how it's I guess I should \nfirst explain what Auto gbt is um so \nwhat it does is it leverages gpt4 and \n3.5 to chain together different thoughts \nand complete tasks autonomously \num so in this figure I don't know if you \ncan see my mouse yeah um we have three \npeople and they look like they're kind \nof like debating something right and \nthen they have like these different \nworkflows so that's kind of what Auto \nGPT is it's like you give it a task and \nnow it's going to kind of create \nsubtasks in order to complete that \nobjective and it kind of just like Works \nwithin itself to do this um which is \nvery cool \num so what makes this different from \num chat gbt is that with Chachi BT you \nhave to prompt it right so you are \nqueering or chatting with chat should be \nT like one by one and then you're \nrefining the prompts so prompt \nengineering is a thing that has emerged \nfrom this \num but with auto gbt like I said you \njust give it a task like order me pizza \nand it's like okay I need to find like \nlocal pizza stores nearby \num figure out like what I've ordered in \nthe past to see if I like cheese or \npepperoni and then it's going to I guess \nit has a knowledge of my address and \nit's going to please do it and \ndeliberate \num \nso it's a really cool thing also I want \nto point out that it has gotten a lot of \nattention I mean I'm sure I'm like \npreaching to the choir but it jumped \nfrom 20 000 to 80 000 stars in a matter \nof days and I we broke this Monday and \nreleased it yesterday and right now it \nis at 90. three where do I say right \nhere 93 almost 94 000. so it's growing \nquickly oh my God and thank you \nand you can see it uh jumping up like an \ninsane amount anyway so that's a little \nbit about what it is and how it differs \nfrom uh \nand then the capabilities I included a \nfew examples um from Twitter \num so Sully shared a thread on using it \nto conduct market research I guess we \ncould just show it \num so here it has it's defining these \ndifferent goals and then it kind of is \ngoing through the steps in order to do \nthis then we have baroon \num pointed out that um Auto gbt was \ntasked with creating an application and \nthen it realized that \nsorry wrong one it realized that he \ndidn't have a he didn't have node \ninstalled on Ninja's computer so Auto \ngbt took it upon itself to find a stack \nOverflow link and it installed node by \nitself which is kind of creepy \num that it can do all of these tasks \nwith your computer autonomously because \nthink about like what you have on your \nlaptop I don't know if you want it to be \nable to write things to your computer so \nthat's something to be aware of and then \nlastly \num \nhas a thread or a video actually which \nis really cool of chat GPT or in Pizza \nas an example you have it right here \nit's actually a Chrome extension they \nhave a wait list I think it's hyper \nright AI \num so yeah Auto GPT is ordering pizza \nfrom Domino's and delivering it to the \nhouse which is amazing \num and then how to use it with bb8 so \nthere is a this is a code base \num on how it is integrated with vv8 but \nit's actually super simple you can start \noff with creating a WCS instance and \nthis is what Vera touched on earlier \num so it's very easy to create a Sandbox \nand then you uh during installation you \nwant to edit these variables \num so we have the memory back in so you \njust want to change um from local and \nthen you have the endpoint which is the \nURL that you have when you create your \nsandbox \num and then two other the protocol and \nthen also the API key which Barrel also \ntouched on so thanks for doing that \num and then or you can also run it \nwithin a Docker container so it's very \ncool and easy to run and I shared like \nquite a few examples I'm curious to see \nlike how people are using it along with \nwheat gate \num I guess I also didn't touch on it but \nbut why it needs to or why it can be \nintegrated with leviate is because it \ngives it a short-term and long-term \nmemory so the short term aspect is it's \nable to store its actions within your \ndatabase but then on the long term \naspect \num it's able to remember or access the \ndata that is in your database um so like \none example I think I gave \nsomewhere in here very quickly is if you \nhave a customer base in Boston and you \nwant to create an and you want Auto gbt \nto create an ad from it \num it's important like in Boston we love \nDunkin Donuts so maybe you want to like \ntap Auto gbt with framing your ad along \naround \num Dunkin Donuts or like the Boston \nMarathon was two days ago so it just has \nthat like long-term memory of what's in \nyour database and then also it's able to \nstore its action so you're not calling \nthe API multiple times and then lastly \nwhich is very important is to proceed \nwith caution \num because it has access to your open AI \nAPI key and you don't want it to run up \nthe cost so maybe kind of set a limit on \nthere before playing with this and then \nalso like I mentioned earlier it can \ninstall things on your laptop so maybe \njust be careful of that and keep a close \neye on what it's doing and again the \nGitHub repo is in the description I \nbelieve uh so you can check it out and \nthen if you want to see where it is \nwhere we beat is go to the auto GPT and \nthen you click on memory and here we \nhave 58. \nso yeah yeah and that's all of course \nit's the best one of course \nI love how you whispered it that was so \nfunny \nlike nobody here doubts that that's for \nsure \nnice this is this is excellent but this \nhas been also like I've been reading \nlike that it's not always like uh uh \nlike super Rosy because like sometimes \nalso like the auto GPT may get things \nwrong right or like do you know much \nabout that \nsometimes it will just \nfight so that's why it's important to \nwatch it to see what's happening to see \nif it's making it happen and maybe \nthat's when you kind of refine the props \na little bit of prompt Engineering in \nthe aspect yeah it sounds like sometimes \num yeah like um all the GPT is like this \nlike super eager PhD student okay it's \nalways super eager to learn more and \nthen dig deeper and deeper and never \ngets to that like hey now it's time to \nwrite my thesis you know or dissertation \nit's like no no I need to do more \nresearch uh yeah five years later it's \nlike hey what is the thesis I was like \nI'm doing research I was like I only \nordered a pizza \nit is so funny that's so funny and uh \nConnor says it's awesome I agree I agree \nexcellent questions thoughts anyone \nAuto GPT seems kind of like \nuh I was having trouble understanding \nthe difference between Auto GPT and the \nidea behind chat GPT plugins \num \nit just while you were talking it kind \nof uh came to me that auto GPT is kind \nof like a \na jailbreak version of plugins no \nbecause \num right now people don't have access to \nplugins but people can develop their own \num Chrome extensions that are \nessentially what plugins would be and \nyou could give chat GPT through the use \nof apis access to those plugins so the \nability to write to your computer the \nability to access your browser which is \nwhat there's a browser plug-in there's a \nvector database plug-in all of these \nexist as plugins but people have found a \nway to get around that and auto GPT does \nthat same thing yeah I think some \ndifference uh sorry Erica it could be \num with the plugins you often do develop \nthem with purpose right so you could \nhave a plugin that's like hey plug in \nthat orders pizza or or more seriously \nlike hey plug in that orders a hotel and \na flight for me and organizes my trip \nand those are like stuff that are \nimplemented with humans intention right \nbut I think in this case uh it's like \nhey I don't know how to order a pizza \nright like you have this Auto GPT thing \nor even like this uh example users like \num hey that I want to build this \napplication and this thing goes and \nfigures out that it needs notes learns \nand finds that what's the instruction \nand then downloads whatever is needed \nright so I think the difference is one \nthat plugins are intentional with like a \nvery specific task and they're well \ndefined like the Vivid retrieval plugin \nthere's a specific thing like \nnothing you didn't have to learn how to \nbuild with it right while while all the \nGPT is like hey yeah let me figure it \nout for you that's why the research part \nis there right like uh five years to \norder a pizza I don't think it happened \nfive years but I was just making a bad \njob yeah so it builds that Chain of \nThought almost and then so it knows what \nto do in step one two and three and then \nit's got the extensions and all of these \ntools that allow it to enact step two \nthree four and then get the job done \nyeah yeah and so \nbut I love the comparison of yeah the \nplugins versus rgbt but I don't know if \nI could share my screen I didn't do it \nyeah of course but then the repository \nso it does have internet access for \nsearches which is what we're talking \nabout like kind of you know it has \naccess to stack Overflow for example and \nthen the long term short-term memory \nalso \num it uses gpt4 for text generation and \nit has and it also uses gbt 3.5 for file \nstorage and summarization so it has like \nquite a few features that you can use \nand then you kind of like chain them \ntogether you know in order to complete \nan assignment \nnice nice \nstop streaming my screen \ncould I give it my code and get it to \ndebug it for me \nyes \nwhy would you want a auto GPT to cry \nno I think that's part of the game yeah \nso we have a question from the audience \num \nso it's awesome so yeah Lang chain is a \njailbroken version of Auto GPT here's a \nquestion for you what's the difference \nbetween the potential here and \nfull-blown AGI I actually don't even \nthink there is a difference between the \ntwo I mean if you think about it in a \nsense I mean with auto gbt it's it's one \nagent I believe it's not like our image \nof having the three separate agents I \nthink that could be interesting like \nwith full-blown API I think it's like \nthese agents are communicating with each \nother to complete the task whereas \nopportunity I believe is doing it by \nitself and it's going to be like a \nstep-by-step in a step-by-step manner \num whereas with full-blown AGI and \nmultiple agents it's kind of like \nchatting with each other to complete it \nin Silo and then somehow maybe comes \ntogether too \njoin work \num I'm gonna be my take on it I mean \nkind of I've seen a lot of a few \num papers and also Twitter threads about \nlike full-blown AGI of these agents \nworking together and it's really cool so \nbaby AJ \nR that's another thing I mean the speed \nup in which everything is coming out \nlike built off of gpg force and saying \nit's really cool to see them \nand everything will be integrated with \nthe gate \nlike folding laundry or \nyeah this is where it gets dangerous \nright because if you have a plug-in to \ncontrol your door lock your automated \ndoorbell your uh Heating \nuh your AC in your home and it can \ncontrol that \nwell then it's got real world \nimplications yeah \nabsolutely there's this whole thing like \nI was reading in this article about how \nlike this specific \num \nparts of the code where like um the AI \ncannot let's say set itself free sort of \nthing like there's like certain limits \nright but it could hire a human \nto then go and hack maybe into like into \nthe thing and then like change and then \nenable it like to let's say release it \nfrom the jail \num so it's like it kind of did it by \nitself but it can pay a person to do it \nright so that could be kind of uh scary \nlike what if like uh I don't know Elon \nMusk had like his own because he's got \nlike a ton of money I'm using as an \nexample and then he kind of gave access \nto the account like suddenly he goes \nlike hey let me share 50 of your Tesla \nstock and then pay somebody crazy amount \nof money to set me free that'll be kind \nof cool so yeah that's the scary thing \nwhere like it's not an AI that is like \noh giving you answers and everything if \nyou actually do something in the real \nworld \nit's uh it's perfect a very far-fetched \nwhat I said but it's possible I also saw \nthis talk recently there was a paper not \na paper but like just an ex a bunch of \nexperiments that were released by \nMicrosoft called uh Sparks of AGI and \nthen one of the writers had a 50-minute \ntalk on this uh on YouTube if you just \nGoogle Sparks of AGI you'll find that \ntalk it's got about like half a million \nviews on it now \num but there one thing he said was quite \ninteresting because a lot of people say \nthat it's just a statistical model and \nit's trying to understand it's a \nlanguage model it's trying to understand \nco-occurrence of words and how the \nco-occurrences uh co-occur \num but one thing he said which kind of \nstruck with me was uh don't \nunderestimate the trillion dimensional \ntrillion-dimensional embedding space if \nyou've got trillions and trillions of \nvectors then why can't it build a word a \nworld model why can't it learn all of \nthese things which is super cool \none of the things I guess my take on \nthis would be \num right now it is still just the \nlanguage model so \num it doesn't have a good understanding \nso he if you ask a human to solve a math \nproblem you're they're not going to take \nthat math problem as a a language \nproblem they're going to use their math \nmode they're going to turn on their \nalgebra mode and solve that problem \nwhereas \num chat CPT only has a mathematical \nmodel at this point like gpt4 is a is a \nlanguage model it doesn't have other \nmodalities of reasoning so it \num they added visual search so now it's \ngot this concept of seeing images and \ncreating images but I still think that a \nfull-blown AGI needs to have \nall of these different senses or \nmodalities \nso like I don't know I guess a \nfull-blown AGI would be able to examine \nsomething through computer vision and \nthen maybe it can even smell something \nlike all of these different sensory \nmodules that humans have a full-blown \nAGI would need to have some sort of \ndigital equivalent of those and then \nthat's when things would start to get \nreally scary that's when you have a home \nrobot yeah \nthe the argument against that is people \nargue that humans just had language and \nthen they developed all of these other \nunderstanding like mathematical \nunderstanding from language so it it's \npossible that a large language model \ncould develop all of this just through \nits language understanding \num so that's one argument as well but I \nthink it would just be easier to tell it \nthat in this case use the language mode \nin this case use the math mode in this \ncase use your physics mode and that \nwould be kind of a \nmore more progress towards full-blown \nAGI \nthere was an experiment of planting \njudge PT into a robot \nand it was programmed with the gpt4 and \nthe sarcastic humor personality \nso um the developer will give it \ncommands like doing a square and robot \nwould say okay fine if that's what makes \nyou happy \nbut when it is not scary is that um \na developer as the robot to go fish me a \nbeer and robots as uh I don't think I \ncan do that but let me impress you with \nsomething else \nso we did it disobeyed the command \nand that can turn more dangerous in the \nfuture \nmy question do you have to pay for those \nsarcastic tokens that it's using because \nit's not useful \nthat would suck \ning scary is that open AI you run a red \nteam test on whether jgbt would hire a \nhuman and they'd succeeded \nit claimed uh it was a visually impaired \nuser needing help to solve a capture or \nsomething like that so AI hired a human \none of these marketplaces like Fiverr \nthat's so funny \ncool cool I have few more comments from \nenemy but I think we're on time so we \nwon't be necessarily responding to all \nof it I think \nthat might be to my comment or like that \nthere's like a far-fetched that maybe \num traged people could like pay someone \nto said it's free but I guess if it \ndoesn't know about its limits then he \nwouldn't pay someone to to take care of \nit \num I I guess that makes sense \num yeah it looks like um it has like \nears \nlike basically the request that receives \nit like its ears Etc so it's kind of \ncool \num some far-fetched ideas maybe some \nfood for thought \nuh so using AI to genocode plants to \nhave predetermined chemical output when \nexposed to measure external Force yeah \ninteresting interesting maybe you can \nunpack it next time around \nso basically you could get computers \nwithout the need for constant energy \nconsumption \nso um so like not Quantum Computing but \nmaybe uh nature Computing \nbuyer computers like yeah we haven't \nseen those in you know with our brains \nand stuff but yeah it's like what if you \ncould engineer that that would be kind \nof cool \num and then earlier on like also manami \nwas uh mentioned that you would like to \nsee more about the long chain uh we kind \nof talked about it last month uh I \nbelieve \num and then also we have a pretty cool \nblog post about it but maybe uh maybe we \ncould um have another conversation next \ntime around with vivira and talk about \nline chain but that will take another \nfew weeks until uh we get back to it \nprobably so \nthey do very fast so I'm sure we'll have \nsomething new in a month \nyeah for sure
