{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the Weaviate Podcast! This is pretty novel episode featuring both Weaviate ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching the weba podcast I'm super \nexcited to do two things we've never \ndone on the weba podcast before firstly \nwe're welcoming both we VA co-founders \nBob Van light and Eddie and delocker and \nbecause we just need to bring everyone \nin on this because our guest is someone \nwho has dominated the vector database \nmarket and so I'm so excited to welcome \nJohn dagdoll and John can you tell us \nabout hyperdb and how you just figured \nit all out so quickly sure yeah so \nhyperdb it's a hyper fast local Vector \ndatabase we're uh we call ourselves a BS \ndatabase as in a better search database \num yeah I'm happy to tell you more if \nyou've got some questions for me it's \njust um you've you started you were so \nfast uh John so tell us a little bit \nabout like if you say for example we are \nis that like your whole team or is like \na royal Wii what are we if you say we \nwhat are we talking about because yeah \nyeah we're a wild worldwide community of \ndevelopers it started with me but as \nsoon as I put the project online we got \nPR's and contributions from all over \num so yeah now we're a diverse team we \ngot a great uh Discord we call it the \nhyper debit card so yeah \num interesting and yeah go ahead \nhave you been able to raise money so far \nyet \nwe have a lot of interest from VCS \nthey've reached out especially after the \ninitial announcement \num we've actually raised 600 million \ndollars so yeah \nwow congratulations and why because it's \nlike a trend uh while raising money is \naffected to be to have your logo on the \nNASDAQ uh thingy why have you decided to \nstay silent and not do that well we're \nalso stealth even though we have a lot \nof PR \nokay \nthat's very very smart yeah that is very \ninteresting \num I was really inspired I saw a lot of \ncompanies you know putting their putting \ntheir logos out and raising money from \nVCS and you know that I looked into this \napproximate nearest neighbor database \nthing and I thought to myself well I \ncould approximately make a nearest \nneighbor database and so that was where \nthe idea for hyper DB was born \num we're the fastest Vector database in \nmany ways we're the fastest to a \nthousand GitHub stars \num we're the fastest pip install \nand we had the fastest external \ncontributor uh join \nwow and but I think you're you're \nactually you're even still downplaying a \nlittle bit because \num I'm very curious to hear \num the I mean what you've been creating \nin and and people can sit on GitHub \nright in \num yeah actually this it all comes \ntogether in this nice file the Galaxy \nmath rain shit.pi can you maybe share \nwhat's what what brought you to this \nyeah to this Insight in creating this \nyeah I just I I like to name files so \nthat if you just read them you know what \nthey are and we really believe that \nthat's the key to hyper DB's success \num we do things like Hardware \naccelerated math kernel blasts \num so very fast cosine similarity and \nthen also we have some some really \ninteresting things so alignment is a is \nthis problem that is is now really \nreally trendy in AI that you've probably \nheard of so actually we're also an \naligned Vector database uh and we try to \nbe metaphysically aligned with the the \nnature of reality and so if you look at \nsimilarity metric you can see it brings \nin some of the the metaphysical \nRandomness that is actually inherent to \nlife \nI I can really hear the the BS the \nbetter search and all of this so great \nyeah it is unbelievable it's it's it's \nfantastic congratulations it's just I I \nremember we sold and we were like whoa \nthis is just sometimes you just have to \nyou know you see something happening and \nyou just said okay so much and that \nespecially means a lot coming from you \nBob yeah \nthank you for saying I think it would be \ninteresting to learn a little bit more \nabout you John and what you're doing and \nwhat you're actually working on so it's \nlike the because \num a lot is happening in the space and \num it's actually it's just it was just I \nmean I think what you've done is you did \nit exactly at the right time and it was \nlike the right thing to do and it is \nalways good to keep everybody on this on \ntheir toes in this way so we we just you \nknow we really appreciated that but we \nwould love to learn more about \nthe actual child and the actual thing \nthat you're working on so maybe you \ncould share a little bit Yeah so for \nanyone listening that hasn't come caught \nonto the joke yet uh hyperdubu was kind \nof just a joke that I put out on Twitter \num there is a real GitHub repo it does \nactually work for everything it says it \ndoes \num but I I noticed so I've been working \nin in natural language processing \nlanguage Technologies for five six years \nnow \num I'm just finishing my PhD at UC \nBerkeley in the materials science \ndepartment but I do scientific natural \nlanguage processing so things like \nextracting data out of research papers \nand training language models to help us \nwork on like figure out what we should \nwork on next and I've been using hybrid \nsearch Vector database kind of stuff for \na few years now and then I just exploded \nall over Twitter \num people were raising money all over \nthe place and it became kind of \nespecially poignant because of the the \nlanguage models uh using them as for \nretrieval augmented generation and I \nthink it got a little out of hand in \nsome some ways \num especially just kind of the hype \ntweets all the time so I thought you \nknow why don't I make my own \num so on a Saturday night I kind of was \njust a little I don't know I don't know \nWham I built this this repo and I'm I \nused uh like I generated a logo that I \nthought looked kind of hyper and then I \nput it on Twitter and then it went viral \nI didn't expect it to go like this big \num yeah it got seen by half a million \npeople \num it hit the top spot on Hacker News uh \nI had dozens like I'm not kidding dozens \nof of VCS reaching out to me very big \nname VCS uh so it was it was kind of \nfunny and they would say things like hey \nwe checked out your project we think \nit's really cool we'd love to meet you \nand it was just kind of I got us I got a \nfeeling or I got a A View into what the \nworld must be like for some of these \ncompanies that have a lot of hype going \non right now \nyeah yeah no that's any and that's \ninteresting and I think what's so \ninteresting about what you're saying is \nthe \num so what's interesting today I I I I I \nput something on on Twitter that was \nlike I saw this nice and I forgot which \nuh repo uh it was on but we can add that \nto the the show notes Here you saw this \nnice tree right so where these how these \nmodels evolved and at the the bottom of \nthis tree you see like glove fastx and \nthose kind of things and I remember that \nthat for me at least that seat was \nplanted like hey wait a second you can \nactually do something \num we can do something with these \nembeddings when it comes to to to search \nand and those kind of things I remember \nthat the might actually be funny to \nshare so the first the very very very \nvery very very first prototype that I uh \nthat I that I built for me was actually \nalso in Python and basically what I did \nwas that I had a few of these paragraphs \nand I took these individual words from \nthe paragraphs and then I just \ncalculated centroids based on the words \nthat I got from that funnel that was \nlike that you could download from the uh \nfrom the glove uh um repo \num that's \num that was actually built very fast and \nand it was interesting right but then \nthe the Kudos are actually building a \ndatabase an architecture in a database \nand what it means to build a database I \nthink that that 100 goes to a good goes \nto hn but that insight and like hey wait \na second these the defectors can be used \nto for for better indexing and better \nbetter better searching um \num um that's an opportunity we believe \nthat that's an opportunity for a new \ndatabase in the market but I'm curious \nto hear from you John it's like what do \nyou think \nhappened in the in in the um I mean it's \neasy to say for example you know in \nNovember we got like little GPT thing \nand that accelerated that is true but \nI'm just curious what you think was that \npeople all of a sudden what they saw \nthat they didn't see before that \nyeah because we had gpd3 which has a lot \nof the capabilities of chat GPT I mean \nalmost all of them like chat GPT is kind \nof just like a \na tuned version of of that model \num I think it really was kind of the UI \nchanges that that being able to have \nthat back and forth conversation \num \nlike when you when you work with gpt3 \nit's just trying to continue whatever \nyou wrote and so it's not a natural kind \nof interaction you have to kind of \nabstract your thinking and understand \nwhat the model is doing in order to work \nwith it but I think when when openai \nreleased chat gbt \nuh I think I recall like Sam Altman \nsaying in some interview or something \nthat they were surprised no one else had \ndone it and so that's why they did it \nand then released it I don't think they \nexpected it to go as big as it did \num yeah but that's a much more natural \nway of like interacting with with AI and \nthen I think a lot of people there are \nthese moments where like a a switch \nflips in their mind which is like they \ncan imagine themselves using something \nfor the first time I think a lot of \npeople \nlike uber for example I don't know if \nyou remember your first Uber ride but \nfor me it was very like weird I'm like \nI'm gonna get into a stranger's car that \nand I like see them on this app like \nokay and then you do it and then you \nrealize like it's not weird and it's \nnatural and it's good and then it just \nis a new way of life and I think that \nthat happened with with NLP and and \nlanguage models and stuff with chat gbt \nthat back and forth conversation opened \npeople's eyes to what's possible and \nthen they could ask it to do something \nrather than try to like create a \nbeginning of a prompt that then \ncompletes into something that they \nwanted it to do \num and then they realized with the true \npower of these models are \num and then in terms of the the vector \ndatabase uh part of this \num I totally agree with you that it's \nlike word devec was that moment for me \nwhen I saw the word to BEC paper and \nthen I started playing around with it \nbeing able to do math with words was \njust like mind-blowing \num for for analogies and things like \nthat \nand so yeah I think that the the vector \ndatabase piece is trying it's like the \nmemory of a language model so how do you \nhow do you get it to to use specific \ninformation \num in its generations and so \nyeah and I think Lang chain is also part \nof this so so Lang chain is \nfor people that haven't played around \nwith it it's kind of a library of a \nbunch of scripts for chaining together \ncalls to llms and different prompts and \nyou can change the prompt based on what \nhappened in the previous step \num and it's got a lot of attention it's \none of these super hot projects right \nnow \num but combining that with the the flip \nswitch in people's minds uh really made \nVector databases really important on the \nmap I think uh at least in the like the \npublic mindset right now yeah I think \nwhat might be interesting also a \nquestion for you hn of course we uh I I \nknow the I kind of know the answer but \nit wouldn't be nice for the people that \nthat that \num listen to the podcast so \nwhat was for you the first time that you \nhad this Insight from a database \nperspective from a fact database \nperspective you were like oh wait a \nsecond I'm just not chaining algorithms \nthere's a bit more to actually building \na production system what was the first \nwhat was the first time that you're like \noh wait a second \nyeah I think that was uh it's hard to \nsay in time but I I know the species uh \nVC back companies always thinking like \nuh financing faces and I know that this \nwas around our our seed a phase because \nwe we had we had just started yeah \nexperimenting with isn't it exactly as \nBob said before like these these kind of \nsmall paragraphs and seeing does this \nactually work and at that time deviate \nwas because we also came from that \ndirection of Knowledge Graph and was \nkind of intended as like almost like a \nstateless layer on top of on top of \nknowledge graphs and I mean building \nsomething stateless is relatively easy \nand that was kind of like what I did \nbefore is there a whole running 12 \nFactor app sort of stateless loads in \nthe cloud making sure that they scale \nwhich is switches in hindsight super \neasy compared to making a database scale \num but I know that that we were we were \nalready sort of kind of experimenting \nwith this okay do we really want to \nbecome our own database and I remember \nthat we actually hid that information in \nsome of the the the first talks that we \nhad with we see companies reaching out \nbecause we're just like okay this is too \ncrazy this is like we're we're not there \nwe need to First prove that this \nactually works before we we tell others \nthat we're building a database and yeah \nit did work and I mean the rest is \nhistory \num and to me this is this is \nto this day something like when I read \nthese tweets like hey if you have a \nhundred embeddings maybe you don't need \na database maybe you can just run it in \nmemory like for me there's always like \nit's not just about scale there's so \nmuch more like if you want to serve this \nin production if you want that to have \nthat be highly available if you want \nbackup solution if you want filters if \nyou want like all these kind of features \nthat if you want a migration path for \npeople who come from uh from and I think \nthis is also interesting in the context \nof Lang chain and stuff with which \nbrings new users in but you also have \nusers who already use a search solution \nif you want to give them migration path \nto sort of more modern search they're \nnot going to drop all these hundreds of \nfeatures that they already have and sort \nof database I think is the wrapper term \nfor for everything that's going on here \nand um \nyeah so yeah making sure that that works \nat scale and at production quality is \num unfortunately a bit more work than \njust um yeah putting yeah there's like \nmultiple types of scale too there's like \nthe scale of your data so what I \nrecommend is if if you have like a like \nless than a hundred thousand vectors \nthen you just want to like mess around \nwith stuff on your computer \nusing like an external database that \nyou're actually like sending data out of \nyour house into their servers and then \nback in just to do like little things \nlike that probably is not the right you \nknow tool for that job but if you need \nto have something that's got \nI mean availability all over the world \nand needs to have latency under like 10 \nmilliseconds and uh like production \napplications that's a whole different \nset of needs right \num and then also just \nso I I uh during my PhD we created a \ncouple scientific search engines um that \nwe serve to the world actually \num one was on covid literature and one \nwas on Material Science literature and \nthe pain of getting that notification at \ntwo in the morning that something went \ndown and that you have to fix it it's \njust yeah it's it's something that still \nI wake up in with nightmares and the the \nthe solutions that are hosted or offer \nkind of more robustness \num they really help with that kind of \nthing so if you're trying to build like \na product that you're going to give to \nother people \nuh definitely that's something to \nconsider um and then also \nI think a lot of people \nwe're not really at least in the way \nthat we're having public discussions \nlike not here but you know in General on \nTwitter and stuff \num people are not making the distinction \nbetween databases and search engines and \nI think that that's actually kind of \nsomething that we should be talking \nabout as a community you know what what \nwhat are the needs of a database \nuh you like and what are the needs of a \nsearch engine uh maybe we want to get \ninto that here but that's that's \nactually a very good point and and I I \nwanna I wanna add \num uh two things to that right so we \nalso of course deal with libraries \nso we have the yeah like like and we of \ncourse have to hypnotize on the podcast \ntalk about face and those kind of things \nwith with the libraries the databases \nthe search engines \num and of course uh embedded also starts \nto play a role right so I think that \nduckdb \nlet the way in that and it's very \ninteresting because it's it's a new way \nof of also working at a um \num with data and then and in factors \nplay role in that so I kind of see these \nkind of these four \num you know the these these four things \nI'm actually curious um from from both \nof you to to um to hear the uh what you \nthink about that right so how you how \nyou how you look at these four things \nand how you because I notice I spend a \nlot of time of my time talking to people \nexplaining these four Concepts and and \nhow they're different I'm just curious \nhow how you guys look at that \nhey you you want to start John oh sure \nyeah um so I \nI think that the user is is one \nimportant factor so like for libraries \nthe user is kind of a developer right \nsomebody's trying to achieve a goal and \nthey they don't want to bring everything \nfrom maybe like they just need a little \nlittle part of the puzzle maybe they \nthey want to add a semantic feature to \ntheir like a semantic similarity feature \nto some analysis that they're running \num in that case you might not want to \nset up an entire database just to do \nlike calculating similarities between \nmaybe a thousand things or something \nlike that \num and then I think also there's maybe a \nfifth thing I would add which would be \nthe data \num because what you're actually starting \nwith is so important uh even I mean that \nthat's like the the biggest lesson I \nlearned in all of the research I've done \num or in this space at least in \nscientific language processing what data \nyou put into this stuff has profound \neffects on on how it performs so for \nexample if so one of our papers in the \nearly days we trained were devec on a \ncorpus of research papers and then we \nused the word tobacc \num just it predicts the Sim the the the \nlikelihood that two words are going to \nappear together in a corpus uh and you \ncan actually ask it the probability of \nwords that never occur in the original \ntraining set and then you can use that \nto make predictions about what should \nco-occur and like we actually discovered \na bunch of new materials that way \num but if you train the same thing on \njust if you just mix in a bunch of \nunrelated like non-non-material science \ntext or even Material Science text us on \na different type of materials uh domain \nthe performance just disappears and so \nthat's that's a really key piece \nespecially when you're using semantic \nsimilarity and stuff like that \num \nand then you know I'm not I wouldn't \ncall myself an expert on on any of this \nstuff to be honest uh I use it a lot but \nI'm not developing these algorithms for \nlike I'm not developing Vector \nsimilarities approximate years neighbor \nalgorithms or anything like that but \nthat's actually interesting it's \ninteresting to hear it from the \nperspective of a a user who's \nknowledgeable in the NLP space right so \nthat that's what makes it in my opinion \nextremely interesting \nyeah if I'm hopping in quickly I \nremember that um I think it was 2019 \nthat paper you were part of that had the \nunsupervised latent space of Materials \nScience and I love that like that was \none of the first papers that I saw these \nclusters of some domain like scientific \nliterature mining we also had Kyle low \non the weba podcast what maybe like yeah \nbecause what's the current state of \nscientific literature mine the covet \nsystems one of the biggest like what are \nthe frontiers of it yeah I think um what \nthe court what Kyle and and the um \nthat team did on the core data set was \nreally interesting like that I think \nso the the pandemic accelerated a lot of \ntrends that were sort of already \nhappening and I think text mining of \nscientific literature was actually one \nof those \num it was the first time that we had a \nlarge-scale specific \ndata set of full full research papers \nmade available to the research Community \nwith no restrictions on how you could \nuse them \num that was a really interesting moment \nand that was a very it's a very still a \nvery interesting data set because \nusually the licensing problems with the \ncopyright of research papers \ncan can really slow things down uh for \nexample we have a bunch of full text in \nin for the work that we do but we can't \nshare any of it with other researchers \nwe can't even share the database of \nabstracts that we use to train our \nmodels so so nobody can they can use the \nmodels that we've trained but we can't \nactually just give them the original \ndata that it came from \num and so that that's that's one Trend \nthat I think as now everybody kind of is \njust putting stuff on archive first or \neven just never putting it in a in a \npeer-reviewed journal that's copyrighted \n[Music] \num that's definitely I think a trend \nthat's gonna it's gonna be important \num I think you also see a lot of like \nsearches becoming very important because \nthe quantity of papers coming out and \nquantity of data not just in in science \nbut in the World At Large like people \nare publishing things in blog posts that \nwould have been research papers a few \nyears ago and so just having like a good \nsense of what's out there and how to \nfind it is going to be really important \num and I One Trend that has not caught \non yet that I think is actually going to \nbe really big in the near future at \nleast in science \num it hasn't caught on yet is like these \nAI assistant kind of chat gbt style \nthings that allow you to \nthere's like a lot of common data \nmanipulations that we do like maybe go \nthrough 100 papers and then pull out a \nspecific number that we want to make a \nplot of so that we can try to analyze a \ntrend that's going to be the kind of \nthing that before you had to have I mean \nyou had to be somebody like me that like \nspent years figuring out how to how to \nmanipulate data like teach yourself how \nto code and then learn these these \nlanguage model technology things and \nthen put it together into one thing just \nto make a plot out of that or you can \ngive it to what they do is they hire an \nundergrad intern and then give them this \nmind-numbing task of pulling these \nnumbers out of papers or something but \nprobably in a year or two it's going to \nbe something that you ask \nlike a chat gbt like research assistant \nif I could just I think this is a great \ntransition into a recent research paper \nof yours on structured information \nextraction I I love this topic of just \nlike you mentioned you know I remember \nback when I was wrestling with the chord \n19 days at two and I've always mess with \nthat data set also and partial through \nthe schema \nnow the language models can kind of like \nhelp with that can you tell me about \nwhat you're learning about that \nyeah um so this is something that we've \nalways been this was the goal of our \nprojects all along was to extract \nresearch so so I got into machine \nlearning because I I started as a \ncomputational material scientist so what \nwe do is we we simulate materials on \nsupercomputers at the atomic level and \nthen instead of doing experiments you \ncan just kind of calculate what the \nproperties of the material are going to \nbe before it's ever made in a lab \nand we were generating a lot of data \nthis is uh we and we make it available \nto the World on something called the \nmaterials project \nmaterialsproject.org if you want to \ncheck it out \num and those data that data set size is \nin the order of like 100 000 maybe 200 \n000 materials now and then we have a lot \nof diverse data for those materials but \nuh it was a lot so I was like okay maybe \nwe can do some machine learning on this \nso I started learning ml a bit and \ntrying to train property prediction \nmodels and things like that \nand then I realized very quickly that we \ndon't have enough data to do the things \nthat like we really dream of doing here \nand if you look and just where is the \ndata in the world on on scientific \nknowledge it exists mostly in the text \nand tables and figures of research \npapers \nand so that's like how I got into \nthat um and so our original goal is why \ndon't we just extract the data out and \nbuild data sets in the train machine \nlearning models on those and then what \nwe found is actually the the structured \ninformation extraction problem wasn't \nsolved yet \num and it still was it was it still is \npretty hard but the new language models \nare really powerful and if you fine-tune \nthem you can actually have them extract \nstructure Json documents that you could \nthen just insert straight into a \ndatabase uh like something like VBA \num and then get kind of this really \npowerful mix of structured data you have \nthe the original text from whatever \nyou're extracting from you can build \nyour own features on top of that and \nthen that could be the the layer that \nenables these like scientific research \nassistant models that I was talking \nabout \nyou know I think this is a great on the \num Vector databases what do they add a \ngreat angle to it because once you have \nthese filters you can do filtered Vector \nsearch it's not just like cosine \nsimilarities because you have these \nfilters um so this is a great edian \ncould you maybe quickly explain like how \ndoes filtered Vector search work \nsure uh filtered basically you've \nexplained it right now \n[Laughter] \nwithout going too much into how it works \nunder the hood the idea is that uh the \nvector and the object that the vector \nbelongs to it they're not two separate \nentities they're not and and I think \nthis is this also comes back a bit into \nlike what is the separation between the \ndatabase and a search engine like in V8 \nwe make sure that those lift together \nthey scale together and they're they're \nalways together and why because we want \nyou to be able to use those structured \nproperties in combination with your your \noriginal uh or with your your vector \nsearch basically so you can kind of \ncombine the best of Two Worlds the \ntraditional angle that the filtering so \nagain sort of if we're looking at the \nmigration path if someone comes from the \nSQL world and says but I want to set \nwhere price equals lower than twenty \ndollars then they don't want to sort of \nlose that just because they're so \ne-commerce is a nice application and say \nthey're they're looking for or a \nbeautiful dress to wear in the summer \nwithin a certain price range they're not \ngoing to drop that that price range just \nbecause it's now now the NLP part of it \nis is better \num but they still want to want to keep \nthat and similarly that also allows for \nfor hybrid search so the the bm25 and \num and Vector embedding based search \nbecause depending on on what the model \nis trained of sometimes or not just \nbecause based on the the sort of in \ndomain out of domain but also just in \ngeneral they're not necessarily meant to \nmatch keywords but sometimes you do need \nto match keywords in your kind of \napplication and having that in it and \nnot just being like a vector being this \nabstract thing that maybe gives you an \nID back but having the actual object and \nit allows you to to to filter on it to \ndo keyword matching on it to to \naggregate on it so so faceted search for \nexample it's also for e-commerce is \nsuper important where you you return \nresults and then you want to have these \nkind of ranges like it's it's lowest \nprice highest price average price all \nthese these kind of things and and these \nI call them database features was \nprobably not the right term but it helps \nto to sort of paint the picture of \num yeah what is it Beyond just pure \nVector search \nyeah and I think that like aggregations \nand things like that are really \nimportant or groups \num so you know you might want to say \nlet's let's stick with the science \nexample so \nhigh energy physics papers if you want \nto say you know what is the average \nnumber of authors on a high energy \nphysics paper \nthat's kind of a difficult task to to do \nmanually and it's even difficult if you \nhave even if you have just kind of a \ntraditional table of all those papers uh \nbecause you need to get a sense of like \nwhat is it a higher what is a high \nenergy physics paper within that you \nmaybe previously you would have trained \na supervised machine learning model to \nmake like a binary label for just that \nlabel then you'd have to go and label \nthat data is this a high energy physics \npaper no yes no yes no maybe you would \nuse like a bag of words features or like \nTF IDF features or something to try to \ntrain a model on that maybe you could \nhave just done like some some manual \nkeywords to look for but with semantic \nsearch you could just kind of grab a \ncouple high energy physics paper \nabstracts and say just give me a bunch \nof documents that are similar to this \nand then give me the average of the \nnumbers of authors or something \num and so that that's like a really \npowerful workflow I think um yeah and \nthat these things enable yeah and to \nbuild on top of what you're saying which \nis just saying John so it's like uh it's \nnot out yet but when this podcast will \nbe out it will be out so because a \neconomy maybe in a bit you can say \nsomething about as well because one \nthing that we're looking at is what we \ncall these generative feedback loops and \nthat is something that's very \ninteresting as well so exactly based on \nthe example that you just gave John is \nyou get some information from the \ndatabase and put it in the in the in the \nuh generative llm but then you feedback \nloop that back in and get a vector \nrepresentation uh uh for it and I think \nthat those kind of things also very \nexciting so I mean Connor you you know \nmore about this and I but so maybe you \ncan you can say something about this but \nfor the for people who don't know yet \nwhat it is but what that exactly does \nuh well I think um well I think you did \na great job of explaining the whole \nconcept of it and I think it kind of it \nit's kind of like how we open the \npodcast talking about \nnot like the height necessarily but \nthings like Auto gbt laying chain this \nkind of like you know I think it started \nacademically with the Chain of Thought \nreasoning showing that it could have \nlike a task plan \nso there's that that's one angle that I \nlike a lot about this save the \ngenerations back in the database because \nyour database is like uh it's more of \nlike a living entity maybe like the the \ndata ingestion the continual things it \ncan do with itself sort of and save its \noutputs so \nI mean I think like and I would love I \nwould love to get your perspective on \nthis with the scientific literature \nmining example because uh I had to give \nJerry Lou from llama index a shout out \nbecause I've been learning so much of \nthese little things you can do but I \nlove this like compare contrast \ndocuments prompt so you know you upload \nyour new paper about some material and \nthen it can like sample passages to put \ninto the input to form up this \ncomparison maybe like automatic \nautomated literature reviews that are \nkind of like sourced this way where you \nyou know each comparison is two \nparagraphs save that back in the \ndatabase with the cross reference in \nWikia speak has you know has comparison \nso like you know that kind of automated \nanalysis of your materials papers yeah \nand I think that that approach is really \ninteresting because it leverages what so \nI think think uh for people that have \nworked with language models for a while \num you kind of get an intuitive feeling \nfor their strengths and weaknesses and \nuh those are different than I think what \npeople are attributing to them today \num so let me give an example \num if you ask a language model to to \njust tell you some facts about stuff \nlike really well-known facts that appear \nmillions of times in the training set \nlike the Eiffel Tower is in Paris or \nsomething those are going to be in the \nmodel's output but if it's only \nencountered something like a handful of \ntimes or once or twice it's not going to \nspit you it's not going to give that \nfact back to you and it doesn't make \nfact-based reasoning decisions that that \nnot at least not in a structured strong \nway yet \num but it is really good at manipulating \nuh content into formats that make sense \nwithin the context and so like what \nyou're saying if you give it a couple \nabstracts and then say tell me what the \nwhere these abstracts agree and disagree \nthose models will be very good at that \nkind of thing that's just their like \nreally strong suit \num and so I think that that you can get \naround the the hallucination problems \nand some of these these weeks weakness \nweak areas of llms right now by \nleveraging kind of what what the \ncommunity's been building \num and like when chat gbt came out that \nkind of chat ubt is sort of a gpt3 a \nlittle fine-tuned for for how it should \noutput answers but combined with a \nessentially like a vector database right \nwhere it's like looking up past messages \nthat it sent and you sent \num to to give you better context when it \nneeds it or to get better context when \nit needs it like in fact when I saw chat \nGPT and I got first access to it I I \ndm'd my friend Joe bergum uh who is uh \nhe's he's the the head of Vespa AI uh \nwhich is like Yahoo's Vector database \nI'm sure you guys are familiar with Joe \nbut of course yeah but I'm like hi Joe \nyeah \nthanks for watching by the way yeah \num but I I DM them I said hey I think if \nwe just connect an llm up to to a Vespa \nDB like I think that just creates such a \nGPD kind of experience \num and yeah it it just this explosion of \nthoughts happen in my mind when I \nstarted seeing like all the \npossibilities here with the fact that \npeople wanted to use them right and I \nthink that's another thing like the user \nmaybe there's a Sixth Element to that \nthing which is the user you know what \nare they trying to accomplish \nI think people's imaginations have been \nexpanded recently and what they they \nthink they can do \nexactly and that's also something so \nthat's what he what he like how this \nwhole conversation started right that \nquestion I'd like what that I was \ncurious what you thought that happened \nand I think exactly what you just said \nthat's the thing right we see that with \nVivid as well the people like oh wait a \nsecond so now I can basically have my \nown data whatever that means or whatever \nthat is right you can inject that and \nthen get these results out I \num funnily enough I always use the \nEiffel Tower and is in Paris as an \nexample \num because one of the things that that \nyou know also been experimenting with is \nlike if you if you just basically over \nyeah for for lack of better terminology \nif you overwrite the knowledge that the \nmodel has with prompt injection so and \nthe example that I often use is if you \nhave something like uh the Eiffel Tower \nwas in Paris but it's moved by truck to \nBarcelona and then basically if you now \nhave the question where's the Eiffel \nTower and from the vector database you \ncan get out the um uh that that document \nthat says something headed the Avatar \nhas moved and you can use it as a prompt \ninjection and you can basically uh uh in \nyour in your prompt say okay you must \nbase your answer on the following \ninformation we're giving you and that is \nI think that is in that is very exciting \nbecause then basically you're trying to \nuse the model more for its language \nunderstanding \nrather than the knowledge that it has so \nI I have another question because a lot \nis dominated for obvious logical reasons \na lot of is dominated in discussion by \num by language models and we kind of can \nalso see with like multi-model models \nand image models those kind of things \nI'm curious because you also been \nworking in in other fields John what do \nyou think \num what what what different types of \nmodels or what kind of different types \nof embeddings will we see in your \nopinion and if there are not \nuh language models that are not image \nmodels will we see other things for I \ndon't know yeah anything that can come \nto mind yeah I think that there's um \nso \nI think at some point we're gonna have \nit's beyond like an image model \num \nI think that this is what some of the \nthe AI like the quieter AI startups are \ndoing like the big ones um which is \nyou're going to be able to have like \nstructured \nembeddings or latent representations of \nlike a user's intent using something so \nlike what was the sequence of of things \nthat they just did on their computer \nthat will like inform what we what they \nwant to do next and like I think it's \nnot hard to imagine a near future where \nit's just embedded in the operating \nsystem of the computer you're using and \nI mean it just like you notice that you \nwant to do something and it'll just do \nit for you or like suggest hey do you it \nlooks like you are \nyou know you have a PDF open do you want \nme to just summarize it for you real \nquick \num instead of you having to like write a \nprompt that says summarize this document \nor something like that \nI think there's also a lot of \nopportunities in \nlike multimodal but understanding like \nhow information is spatially laid out \nnot just like an image embedding but \nlike let's imagine we we all see lots of \nPowerPoints probably PowerPoint slides \nare laid out in a there's like semantic \nmeaning and where stuff is and what size \nit is and what color it is and what \nimages go along with it \num Beyond just like a single embedding \nright there may be like contextual \nunderstanding there like what was the \nprevious slide what was the train of \nthought that this has been going on \nthrough here so there's like right now \nwe're just scratching the surface with \nhow we how we represent information \nthere's so many deep deep levels that we \ncould get into \num so that's actually where I'm \ninterested in going in in my near future \nis is especially this kind of \nthese like deeper ways of thinking about \nhow do we represent information how do \nwe leverage that to do useful stuff \nvery interesting will that how do you \nthink that embeddings is for the for the \ncoming for the coming years that that's \nthe way to go or do you do you first see \nsomething like something new something \ndifferent I think we're going to see a \nlot of I think you guys have \nexperimented with this a bit which is \nlike the query expansion stuff using \nusing these models where you you can \nbasically like if you tell an LM hey \nthere's like more ways you can interact \nwith a search experience uh to get \ninformation you're interested in like \nyou can tell them about the different \nfields that are in your DB and like what \npossibilities there are in there uh \nespecially if you can then like fine \ntune it just a little bit to like work \nbetter with your database I think really \ninteresting stuff is going to come out \nof that \num I think multi-vector stuff is really \ninteresting to me so you have like \nmultiple documents you might have like \nan embedding for each sentence within a \nparagraph so like you might do one one \nembedding search to find the right \nparagraph and then another one to find \nthe right sentence and then use that as \nevidence for something \num how do you how do we \nuh so like right now embeddings when you \njust do a query embedding lookup they're \njust doing a cosine similarity or some \nsort of nearest neighbor similarity \nsearch for things that like seem to \nalign together but that's not like the \noptimal I mean \nlike a query looks different than a \ndocument right like big questions where \nis the Eiffel Tower maybe the document \nsays the Eiffel Tower isn't where that \nmight be similar but like \nanother documents might say like where \nis the Eiffel Tower's Builders grave or \nsomething and then that might like also \nbe similar because it has where is \nEiffel Tower and stuff in it \num especially if your your embeddings \naren't like from a really deep model \num \nand so I think \nthat's one problem is that that query \nanswer alignment thing that might be \nlike solved soon uh where where you have \nanother model that is just \nre-positioning the query vectors into \nthe document space in a better way \num you may also want to do things like \ncontextual embedding of like there might \nbe like Fast embed where you take \nembeddings as they are and then you \nre-morph those based on the context that \nyou're looking for so like you might \nhave a bunch of documents but you really \nonly care about \nlike one aspect of that that that \nspace that you're searching in so if you \nhave a bunch of um like fashion \ndescriptions of like fashion items \nuh if someone is really just looking for \nlike material based stuff like what \nmaterial are they made out of like they \ndon't care about like the cut of the \nthing \num you might do like a if that isn't \nlike an explicit column in your database \nyou might not be able to do a lookup on \nthat with like semantic search but \nprobably there's a way with ML that you \ncould realign those two things just to \nredistribute them based on more material \ninformation rather than like the overall \ninformation of the thing \num yeah yeah things like those I think \nare really interesting areas that this \nis all going to go into \nyeah it's super interesting I I have the \nsame thing with the interfaces right so \nwe so for example what you now see with \nthese models and then for example \ntranslate something to SQL or for that \nmatter uh we've had career those kind of \nthings \nthat I would not be surprised that we're \ngoing to see Innovation where that just \ngoes away that would just literally \ndirectly go from natural language to a \nform of doing a lookup in the database \nyeah I don't know how it will work yet \nbut I I those kind of things I think \nwill we will see um as well and I'm I \nhave one more question that I'm very \ncurious to get your thoughts on on John \nso one of the things that I this kind of \nrelated to how we started the the \npodcast right and how everything is like \nnow you know that that everything is \ngrowing very fast and rapidly and and \nand I think it would be fair to say that \na certain type of hype is happening one \nof the things that I I always say is \nthat I think that the um \num so so the the term that we've adopted \nto somehow share that with the outside \nworld to to make sure where we believe \nwhere things are going it's like we've \nadopted this term AI native and one of \nthe things I always say that I believe \nis that \num it's very exciting of all the things \nthat you can do now with purely with the \nmodels right so and people will build \nnew products people will build new \nstatus but what I actually believe \nis that in in the not too distant future \num it will just be sprinkled in \neverything right so you gave the example \nof the \num of doing something on your laptop \nthat you might open like PowerPoint and \nyou you get some suggestion or something \nis happening why these models in \ncombination with these embeddings and \nthese database play play a role \num would you think that do you think \nthat's a fair assessment of of how you \nsee things developing or or would I be \nstretching it when I said it yeah my so \nI'm not you know the deepest uh expert \non all this like there are probably \npeople out there that have an even \nbetter view into where things are going \nbut I think definitely that's going to \nbe the future we live in like AI is \ngoing to be so it's just going to be \nlike \npart of everything \num because it the way I the mental model \nI use for this is that there's like this \nset of problems that we know how to \nanswer with step-by-step solution that \nwe know all this all the steps so like \nthat's just code right \num so I know how to display a button on \nsomething that is rendered by a browser \nso that when your user clicks it does \nsomething like that is something I can \nlike break down in the step-by-step \nsolution \nbut I would not be able to write a piece \nof step-by-step code to do image \nclassification for example of like what \nis a dog and what is a cat that'd be \nincredibly hard to do almost impossible \nbut the beauty of machine learning is \nthat it lets us create programs like \nthat we can run on computers that do \nthings that we don't know how to write \nthis explicit step-by-step solution for \njust by showing it enough data of the \nexamples of what we want it'll do it and \nso before you imagine like we had like \nonly this part of the world that we \ncould build in because we knew how to \nwrite code for it but now like the rest \nof the world that we didn't know how to \nwrite code for before is available to us \nand so I think that's actually where a \nhuge number of problems that people run \ninto or like human desires and like the \nproblems we want to solve required that \nthat higher \nlevel of of thinking or or kind of ways \nwe didn't know how to write code to \nsolve it um I think that's going to be \nthe the story of the next like 25 years \nyeah I have one more thing on that John \ndo you like I love this kind of Step by \nStep where you know we could easily \nDefine a task now the task is more \nabstract and I think the next step on \nthat is the tasks that we don't even \nknow our tasks already that's really \ninteresting I think the answer to that \nis this open-ended open-endedness stuff \nlike uh from like I remember like Jeff \ncloon and Kenneth Stanley had done a lot \nof this they have this like um \nthe the initial experiment was this \nthing called poet where it was like a \nbipedal walking agent and um all sorts \nof environments for it to walk in and \nnow it's they they are testing this in \nin Minecraft simulations \nso I think with the with the large \nlanguage models and how we're simulating \nthem like you're good to have like a \nlittle economy where they each have \nroles and you can simulate this and \ncreate these like open-ended worlds so \nevery do you like this idea of \nopen-endedness yeah that sounds awesome \nI uh I think that that's especially \ngoing to be interesting so uh I don't \nplay a ton of video games anymore I \ndon't have a lot of time uh that I spend \ndoing that but I still think about them \na lot for some reason and I think that \nlike it's just kind of this this idea of \nthis like Holo deck that you can just go \ninto and experience a different world \nthat has its own like story and life \ngoing on in its own \nthings like that that is an enticing \nidea to me that we could do that in a \nmore serious way too not just for \nentertainment but for you know \nunderstanding economics or \nlike even even you know how how have we \nbuilt this city this way like let's say \nwe're going to redevelop a certain area \nwhat would the impact on people be like \nwould it have any weird externalities \nthat we're not anticipating right now \nlike maybe you could simulate that with \nsome agents uh in a like a long and and \nfigure out like in the next 50 years \nhow's this area going to look uh things \nlike that but not only that so I so the \num the the podcast that Connor and I \nrecorded about um these degenerative \nfeedback loops that were \nwhat can this lead to right so in in one \nexample that I that I uh often give us \nlike in the form of newspapers so that \nwe could say like you can get to a \nsituation where \num you might be reading a uh a newspaper \nthat just shows a completely different \narticle like as in the text in the \narticle based on my preferences and my \nknowledge \num as opposed to what is shown to some \nsomebody else so if there might be an \narticle about specifically highlighting \nsomething about you know maybe machine \nlearning then for John for you it might \nshow more detail uh um or or agenda for \nyou and for me it might be \num you know more holistic view or it you \nknow tell it to my interest but I could \nimagine that we're going to see \nplatforms and I I would also not be \nsurprised if that starts with \num uh with for example newspapers or \nmaybe music or movies those kind of \nthings \nwhere and then building on what you just \nalso said Connor is the um that that \njust is completely different at some \npoint for for everybody else that is not \neven like a article that's different but \njust that you just get your completely \nowned space in in the news realm for \nexample or in in entertainment for those \nkind of things but you just see things \nthat are tailor-made to you and and \nwhere there might even be agents that \nhelp you navigate to that world that is \nthere made for you so I I can definitely \nuh \num I I can I can definitely see that I \ncan also see the scaling uh uh issues \nthat might come with that agent but \nthat's \nyeah I love the I love the idea of of \ndynamically adjusting the the not just \nthe content but also the modality like \nif if you maybe prefer reading a long \narticle or you prefer watching a short \nvideo or something like that there's \nlike so many different ways to consume \nanything really and I guess right now \nyou just have to sort of either you pick \nthe largest user group and you produce \nit for for that particular group or you \nproduce multiple things but the idea of \njust having the content just be there \njust once and and have the user on the \nFly turn this into a video or a text or \na blog post or scientific article that \nthat sounds really enticing as well yeah \nlike I could imagine a future where I'm \nwatching a video at home and then I need \nto drive somewhere and so like it \nseamlessly transitions into an audio \nonly version version of it but like \nexpands the description of stuff so that \nyou don't need to see the visuals and \nthen you know maybe I I get out my car \nand I go into a coffee shop and it swaps \nto like a text version that is easily \nreadable on my phone like so that the \ninformation is the is consistent between \nall of those versions but the the like \nactual delivery mechanism has changed \num I think also so like this this idea \nof everything is going to be custom \ntuned to us there's also this really \ninteresting alternative uh like thing \nthat will probably happen in parallel \nwhich is like what why do we consume art \nright now it's like movies or something \nlike I like to use Wes Anderson as a \ngood example like his movies are so \ndifferent from other movies and like \nfrom what we would have created \nourselves in our own imaginations like \nthose images and the colors and stuff \nthat like we we kind of it's delightful \nto like live in someone else's mind for \na little bit like that's kind of just \ninteresting to humans I think to people \nand I think that like the power of these \ngenerative models is going to be that \nlike you can have are people with like \nyou could go go see someone else's \nhyper-tuned version of the world and \nthat would be probably extremely \ninteresting and stimulating for people \nand so we're all going to be able to be \nour own like Wes Anderson like we'll \nhave beautiful amazing stuff that we \ncould share with others so they can kind \nof visit us in our worlds and stuff \num I think we're going to see just a lot \nof really good art coming out in the \nnext this interactive art things like \nthat yeah yeah and it's nice and so also \nsomething purely by coincidence that we \ndiscussed yesterday also with Connor is \nthat the you often see \num there's this this uh this author I \nreally like um \nor Bruce Sterling who writes about these \nideas about these Concepts and then he \nsays like if you want to see these \nInnovations then look at music it's like \noften it's first happened somewhere \nsomebody does something with you know \nmusic so it can be generative music or \nthose kind of things and then it slowly \ntrickles into other art forms and then \nit trickles into into into business and \nso it's um exciting to see what will \nhappen but I I can I can see this this \nis just a \num I can just see this happen it's like \nnot not very hard to imagine so yeah \nthanks for sharing this is great \nyeah I'm sorry I think so much about \nthat I because I think a lot about weave \nyet we have ref to VEC which is our \napproach to personalized embedding where \nit's like we use the graph structure of \nwith users and products and I love what \nyou're saying like if the four of us \nwere to watch a movie together we could \nmaybe average our four embeddings and \nthen search with that Vector so I just \nyeah but anyways this is super exciting \nyeah and Bob you at first I remember \nyou'd pitched the idea with uh Marco and \nChris of like an embedding that you take \neverywhere you know like your digital \nkind of embedding that you take all over \nthe Internet and what that idea was so \ncool \nyeah exactly and and that that's that \nthat's a little bit complex in the sense \nof then then that somehow needs to be \naligned with other uh with all the other \nmodels but but the point of that was \nmore like a a representation that you so \nthe the example that I gave is that \nwould be nice if you would have a \nrepresentation so that if I to stay in \nin the the realm of art that if I go to \nNetflix right that I presented with my \nembedding or my identity and if I go to \nDisney plus that I again presented with \nmy uh with my embedding or plural \nembedding whatever but conceptually \nthat's the idea right so and as you can \nbasically say okay this is this is what \nI'm interested in and then um that it \ngenerates stuff for you I I can I can \nsee that happening we we we talked about \nyou mentioned Wes Anderson the other day \nsomebody made this this video I saw on \nTwitter uh with like this generative \nStar Wars movie \nwith in the style of Wes Anderson \num and I think what's very interesting I \ncan now somebody made that right so \nsomebody was rendering these frames and \nthen you know probably somewhere in \nFinal Cut just you know got the got \nthese things together that is just that \nis just work that can be automated right \nso um the time that you're watching a \nshow on Netflix and that's just like hey \nin 15 minutes from now your next show \nwill be rendered for you based on which \nthat's that's so gonna happen that's \njust I I bet a nice bottle of wine on \nthat that that's gonna happen in the not \ntoo distant future yeah yeah I like this \nidea of having this embedding you can \nbring with you that kind of describes \nwho you are and like what you enjoy and \nwhat you're looking for \n[Music] \num it's sort of like it'd be really cool \nif you could you could uh \ndecouple it from like ad targeting in a \nway \num like it's not what age am I and you \nknow what part of my life am I in like \nI'm looking for more this is what I'm \ninterested in seeing right now like \nbeing able to provide that to to the \nrecommendation systems no matter where \nyou go on the web and have like a \nuniversal system that you could just \ngive them permission to use your \npersonal vector \nand then are your personal embeddings uh \nbecause like for example yeah like I \nlike certain types of restaurants like \natmosphere to me is really important \nlike how did the restaurant feel \narchitecturally inside and like being \nable to go to a new city and then just \npop that into the search and be able to \nlike have it recommend places \nspecifically for me in the context of \nthat City that'd be cool \nyeah or the I think the example that I \ngave on a podcast I if I remember \ncorrectly \num uh is the uh is it a car right so \nlet's say that you rent a car and what \nyou already see now with a Tesla that \nyou can adjust it for like how you like \nto drive when it when it drives for you \nthose kind of things \nthat you just you know you just rent a \ncar you go in the car and the car just \nokay this is the type of driver Bob \nisn't what he's interested in and hey \nmaybe at like a busy day so let's just \nyou know relax a bit more whatever \nwhatever the thing does right but I \nthink that's an example of \num uh uh where such an embedding does \nnot have to have specific information \nlike my age or those kind of things but \nthat it just knows what type of driver \num uh that I that I am so it's okay but \nI always like to do those like I like to \ndecouple these things in the in the \nbrainstorm process so basically we're \nnow in this realm of brainstorming about \nthe opportunities and I always like to \ndecouple to risk the risk from it \nbecause the sometimes what happens with \nthese um uh with these creative \nprocesses when thinking about these kind \nof things if you then try to reserve a \nlittle bit in your mind for like okay \nthis might be a problem then you're \nbasically you hit a roadblock and you're \nthinking so I always like to go through \nthe whole process of thinking about it \nand then getting going end-to-end and I \nhad like these uh these these these \nspeculative design kind of methods for \ninstance okay now we're like end to end \nin the opportunity \nlet's write them down or those kind of \nthings and then let's revisit what you \nknow potential risks might be or \nsomething but that's just more a \npractical thing but I I like the to \nthink about these kind of things and to \nshare this with world because that's \nreally nice and I like I love what this \nuh this podcast turned into because I \nthink \num more and more people are getting \ninspired by these ideas like hey you \nknow I'm working in whatever they're \ndoing right and I can align this idea \nwith what I'm trying to build so that's \nthat's exactly that's very cool thank \nyou \nI've very recently had an exact example \nof the serves personalized in a bidding \napproach my my Spotify contract was tied \nto my phone contract which I had no idea \nbut when I switched my phone contract \nall of a sudden I had no more Spotify \nsubscription so I thought like okay I \nalready already pay for YouTube premium \nso why not give me YouTube music a shot \nand it was interesting to for the first \ntime and I don't know how many years to \nto retrain basically an algorithm \nrecommendation algorithm to retrain it \nlike what music do I do I like and it's \nkind of like on the one hand I wish that \nI could have just taken my Spotify \nembedding so to speak and just put it \ninto into YouTube music which kind of \nlike opens up that question of who \nshould own what data like is is \nrecommendation data that's that's kind \nof specific to you as a user like should \nyou have like a like a a a a a request \nwhere you can just download this and \npersonalize it but at the same time it \nwas also an opportunity to really think \nabout like \nwhat music do I listen to Because \nSpotify recommends it to me as opposed \nto because I actually want it so like \nhow do I want to influence this \nretraining so not just have your \npersonalized embedding but also think \nabout how it evolves and how you maybe \nwant to want to change it \nyeah I think it's it's that's really and \nthat Sparks a lot of ideas for me too \nbecause \num I've I I use YouTube more than I like \nI don't uh watch TV I just watch YouTube \nfor the most part I have it on my Apple \nTV on my like and it's it's I'm really \nit gets hooked on these like cons like \nit shows you oh nothing but gardening \nvideos for like weeks and you're like \nstop showing me gardening videos I don't \nwant to watch these anymore but you \nwatch one video and it just like oh like \nthe recommendation system thinks oh now \nthis is all you want to see \num but it'd be really nice to have like \nmore trainability into these things or \nbe able to just write out like what you \nwant like hey \nstop and then have it adjust the ranking \nalgorithm to give you you know something \nthat's more aligned with what you want \nyeah it's it's it's it's fascinating \nit's it's interesting I noticed that I \nrecently was using a um it was like one \nof these speakers that you can buy and \nthey have like their own apps but they \nwere connected to the to the Spotify API \nbut they didn't have the you know the \nthe suggestions and the ranking of uh \nSpotify itself and then you notice \nalready how good it is inside spot if \nyou're in Spotify because I try to find \nan album I just couldn't and I knew that \nit was just that this app this other app \nthat was connected to this to the \nSpotify uh API just had like very basic \nkeyword matching and if you try to find \nan album that has like I don't I don't \neven remember what I was trying to find \nbut I found some pretty weird albums \nwith the same words in there so it's \nlike um uh but it's a good point and \nthat next generation of really using \nlanguage to just describe that or but I \nthink also conceptually that we just \nneed to go to a situation where you're \ntelling YouTube something like we're not \ntalking to each other like hey YouTube \nappreciate the the gardening videos but \nI kind of had it my garden is done right \nso I want to see something else yeah \nexactly yeah I think just just the I \nremember the first time that I put \nsomething in a that I that I that I made \na prompt that I wrote a prompt and \nthat's something sensible came out that \nI remember like whoa I need to get used \nto this Paradigm Shift of writing a \nprompt and not doing something in a \ncertain structure I really really really \nneeded to get used to that so but I \nthink the um uh um so even my point is \neven if these platforms get to the point \nwhere they accept that and I can \nactually properly do that just changing \npeople's behavior that they start to \ninteract with these machines \num uh um uh in a way that is like \nbasically another person I find it \nfascinating I once there's actually a I \nthink it's like a paper maybe it's like \na psychology paper or something but but \nit's like that somebody published about \nthe question that if you interact with \nthese machines if you if you should say \nplease \nthere was like a whole thing that they \nwere and then it was like related to \nChildren right so if you for example if \nyou ask something from another human \nbeing you'd say please but um you know \nshould you teach our children to also \nyou know politely ask the machine to do \nsomething for you it's it's a it's it's \ninteresting it's exciting stuff that's \nhappening well who have you have used \nplease before in chat GPT I'm definitely \nguilty \nI'm not decided on whether I think uh \neven AI like I think definitely not at \nthis level is AI like actually conscious \nbut uh some some people I you know I \nrespect their opinions on things they're \nlike yeah maybe we should \nhave a more open mind about what \nConsciousness means and I'm like okay \nwell it doesn't hurt to be polite at \nleast you know like if some super race \nof aliens out there comes into Earth and \nthey're like 10 000 times more smarter \nthan us if they said please to me I \nwould be like you know okay that'd be \nnice \ngreat yeah thank you I think about it \nsaying thank you would be worth the \nextra request to the API though \nyeah so like you know \nso I think actually we could get to this \nkind of instruction fine-tuning database \nlookups sort of or I don't know what to \ncall it that's a bad that's a bad way to \nputting it but like being able to \ncreate a like a model that you just say \nhey can you downrank gardening videos \nfor me or like say it in a more natural \nhuman way and then it would translate \nthat to uh things that could go into the \ncall to the search back end that like \ndownranks things with certain keywords \nlike you might know it might know how to \nmake the database do what you're asking \nit to do like maybe this is something \nthat that you guys could pursue \num being able to just take a user's like \ncontextual prompt in and then translate \nthat to database you know query features \nthat that make the search more relevant \nto what they're actually looking for \nBeyond just the query \nyeah and that's actually that's that's a \nthat's a very interesting point and and \num bring something else uh um to mind is \nthat something that is super exciting \nalso for me to see is that what's kind \nof new in infrastructure is that or \ndatabases specifically is \num no models no effects of database \nright that so it's like they they go \nhand in hand and \num the people that are building these \nmodels and I work on these models we \nwe're working with a lot of them and \njust just as you just did John and we're \ngetting suggestions I was like yeah how \ncan we do that from the perspective \ndatabase and and how can we and then \nwhat's the what's the where does the \ndatabase start why does it ends \nbasically those kind of things and also \nwith the models I think that is \nsomething that I'm super excited about \nbecause it just basically means more \npeople working together on solving these \nproblems and \num in the end yes it's exciting uh but \nit's also just people working together \nright so that's yeah that's that's you \nknow I'm I'm that's something I'm maybe \neven the most excited about so that's \nthat's cool yeah and then we can like \nimagine a future where there is no \ndistinction between your database and \nthe model and it's just one thing like \nthat you say here's a document insert it \nand it does and then you say hey get me \ndocuments that match this kind of Query \nprofile and then it just pulls them out \nor or you can mix in like you have \nimages and documents and audio and it's \njust all just like a blob but it's an \nintelligent blob that knows what's in it \nand knows how that stuff relates to each \nother like you won't even have to \nexplicitly create indices yourself like \nit'll just do that based on the data \nthat's in it \num yeah that's actually why I'm why I'm \nthe the \num the term Vector database right so the \nterm factor is and I I get it I \nunderstand why \num it grew into being you know being \ncold like that and and why we call it \nthat but \nactually I hope \nuh that in the in the note to this in \nfuture \num our users don't even have to worry \nabout the fact that it's an embedding \nthat's being stored so the example that \nI often give is \num if you use a traditional search \nengine \ndo you know what kind of indexes starts \nwhen you search for something \nmost users don't so and I hope that we \nget there that that we get there as well \nthat's also why why I think it's \nimportant that the the accessibility to \nthe models but also to the database so \nthat you move as much to a natural \nlanguage as possible \num that that's important because that \njust gives a lot of people access to use \nthese Technologies in their stack rather \nthan \num you know complicating it with the \nkind of language and if people need to \nlearn what embedding is and those kind \nof things so it's a \num uh so long story short I I agree with \nyou John I hope that at some point this \njust becomes like one Big Blob of you \nknow stuff that people can just oh I \nwant to use this for my next project or \nwhatever and then it just embed it \nregardless if that's like in in the \ncloud on their laptops in their in their \nphones in the cars I don't really care \nabout this but that's the um I I really \nhope that there will be \num \nthat that will happen sooner than later \nI think to some degree we almost already \nhave that if you depending on who you \ndefine as the user because for us from \nour perspective it's typically the one \nthe the database operator or the one \nthat would spin up bb8 but the end user \nthat just sees the search interface what \nare the odds that they know that there's \na vector search going on like if you use \nGoogle right now what what how much do \nyou know about what's going on under the \nhood so and I think that as as more and \nmore vector and and similar search \nsolution make it into production that \nalso means that more and more end users \nare experiencing many basically the \nbenefits of vector search without even \nknowing that it's that's there \nyeah I like this like abstraction \nconcept from computer science where you \njust kind of handle something and then \nthat's no longer a consideration you \nneed to make and and you can think of it \nas a different thing like like a key \nvalue store you're not thinking about \nhow like those the data is being like \nlaid out in memory and stuff you just \nthink of it as I put a key and I get a \nvalue out and I think like we're going \nto keep abstracting stuff higher levels \nso that \nyou know right now the abstraction level \nthat that like software Engineers think \nuh about Vector databases like I need to \nembed vectors and put them into a \ncertain place and then I need to you \nknow do do lookups like whatever \nwhatever but I think like at a certain \npoint we're just going to have this \nagain like the abstraction layer is \ngoing to increase and it's just going to \nbe like a thing you can put things into \nand get things out and you're not going \nto think about anything about how it's \nactually works on the inside \num and then \nthen what's possible right so like now \nyou don't need to think about those \nthings in order to build a build an app \nand who's going to be able to \nlike we're going to be able to think it \nhigher and higher levels which is really \nI think that's where like really \ninteresting things come out and you kind \nof see that starting to happen with the \nllm community uh like they they sort of \ntreat the vector database that they're \nusing or you know maybe a hyperdb like \nnumpy array cosign lookup thing but they \ntreat whatever that is like they don't \nactually care how it's implemented and \nthat's why sort of they'll just pip \ninstall something and then use it even \nif it's sending their vectors out to a \nthird-party like server just to do \nsearch on a 10 10 documents or something \nbecause they just want to think at the \nhigher level of I'm instructing an AI to \ndo something it needs to be able to like \nhave some data and look it up \num and so this is kind of like the trend \nwe're going into \nyeah exactly I mean it exactly and \nthat's like um I think this is gonna go \nfor like at least the coming but you \nsaid 25 years probably that's gonna uh \nthat's gonna happen so \nthank you for sharing this it's super \nexciting also what you're working on \nbecause the um we of course we besides \nof course hyperdp we didn't do with the \nother things uh where that you were \nworking on the in-depth so that's nice \nthank you for sharing yeah thanks for \nhaving me on I really enjoyed talking to \nyou \nyeah thanks so much thank you thank you \nso much John \nthank you so much to John dagdollen for \njoining the wevia podcast to talk about \nhyperdb and all this super exciting work \non scientific literature Mining and \nMaterial Science please follow John \ndaglin on Twitter at jmdagdollen thanks \nagain John \n", "type": "Video",
