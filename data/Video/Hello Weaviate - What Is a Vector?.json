{"text": "Weaviate Academy Unit 1: Vectors. \nhey there and welcome \nlet's talk about vectors and their role \nin waviate by the end of this section \nyou'll have a better understanding of \nwhat vectors are and how they help to \ncapture meaning in various contexts \nso what is a vector \na vector in this context is simply a \nseries of numbers like these they can be \nany length from just a few to thousands \nof numbers or even more \nin data science vectors like these are \nused to capture meaning now this is \nquite a strange concept at first so if \nyou're puzzled you're definitely not \nalone \nbut actually many people have used \nvectors without realizing \nif you've ever used photo editing \nsoftware or Ms paint you're very likely \nto have used vectors let's consider the \nRGB system which many of us have used to \nselect colors for example 25500 \nrepresents red 0 0 is black and other \ncolors are represented by numbers \nin these examples each number can be \nthought of as a dial for how red how \ngreen or how blue a particular color is \nin other words we've used numbers three \nintegers in this case to represent some \nmeaning which are colors \nnow imagine having hundreds or even \nthousands of these dials with infinite \ndegrees of variation using floating \nPoint numbers \nthat's how vectors are used to represent \nranges of other more complex meaning \nmodern models like gpt3 4 or those used \nwith aviate use vectors in this manner \nto represent the essence or meaning of \nobjects \nand this can be done for any object type \nsuch as text code images videos and more \nso if you've heard people talk about \nVector embeddings you now know exactly \nwhat that is \neach Vector embedding is a \nrepresentation of such meaning \nanother really interesting part of this \npuzzle is how these embeddings are \nderived which is through these amazing \ndeep learning models \nits advances in this field that's really \npowered the modern revolution in AI in \nthe past couple of decades or so \nbut we'll get to all that later for now \nall you need to know is that vectors are \na series of numbers they can capture \nmeaning in various contexts \nwe'll aviate as a vector database \nleverages Vector embeddings to perform \nsimilarity-based searches and other \npowerful operations on different types \nof data \nas you continue to explore wave 8 you'll \ngain a better intuition for how they \ncapture meaning and how Vector search \nleverages those \nokay that's it for this video thanks for \nwatching and we'll see you soon \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Hello Weaviate -
