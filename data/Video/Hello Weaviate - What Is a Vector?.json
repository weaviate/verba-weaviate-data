{"text": "Weaviate Academy Unit 1: Vectors. \nhey there and welcomelet's talk about vectors and their rolein waviate by the end of this sectionyou'll have a better understanding ofwhat vectors are and how they help tocapture meaning in various contextsso what is a vectora vector in this context is simply aseries of numbers like these they can beany length from just a few to thousandsof numbers or even morein data science vectors like these areused to capture meaning now this isquite a strange concept at first so ifyou're puzzled you're definitely notalonebut actually many people have usedvectors without realizingif you've ever used photo editingsoftware or Ms paint you're very likelyto have used vectors let's consider theRGB system which many of us have used toselect colors for example 25500represents red 0 0 is black and othercolors are represented by numbersin these examples each number can bethought of as a dial for how red howgreen or how blue a particular color isin other words we've used numbers threeintegers in this case to represent somemeaning which are colorsnow imagine having hundreds or eventhousands of these dials with infinitedegrees of variation using floatingPoint numbersthat's how vectors are used to representranges of other more complex meaningmodern models like gpt3 4 or those usedwith aviate use vectors in this mannerto represent the essence or meaning ofobjectsand this can be done for any object typesuch as text code images videos and moreso if you've heard people talk aboutVector embeddings you now know exactlywhat that iseach Vector embedding is arepresentation of such meaninganother really interesting part of thispuzzle is how these embeddings arederived which is through these amazingdeep learning modelsits advances in this field that's reallypowered the modern revolution in AI inthe past couple of decades or sobut we'll get to all that later for nowall you need to know is that vectors area series of numbers they can capturemeaning in various contextswe'll aviate as a vector databaseleverages Vector embeddings to performsimilarity-based searches and otherpowerful operations on different typesof dataas you continue to explore wave 8 you'llgain a better intuition for how theycapture meaning and how Vector searchleverages thoseokay that's it for this video thanks forwatching and we'll see you soon", "type": "Video", "name": "Hello Weaviate - What Is a Vector?", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFUeV3aYynI", "timestamp": "", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
