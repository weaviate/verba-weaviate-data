{"text": "Weaviate Academy Unit 2: Aggregate. \nhey there to welcome backin this video we'll introduce you toaggregate queries a powerful way tocompile information from multipleobjects and gain insights from your dataaggregate queries allow to combinedinformation from several objects into asingle one providing you with anoverview of the groupthis is especially useful when you wantto extract insights that describe theresults set as a whole such as how thesearch results might differ from therest of the data setthe Syntax for aggregate queries issimilar to get queries but there aresome key differenceslet's take a look at the basic Syntaxfor an aggregate querywith aggregate queries you can retrievewhat we call Meta properties such as thecount as well as aggregations of eachpropertiesnow as you might imagine differentoperations are available to youdepending on the data type of thepropertywhile we could aggregate numbers toobtain the mean maximum or the minimumwe couldn't do that for texts andsimilarly operations like getting countof tokens would only be available fortextsin other words the availableaggregations depend on the data type ofthe property being queriedyou can also use Vector searchparameters like near text in anaggregate querybut because Vector search finds objectsby degrees of similarity it doesn'texclude any objectsso when performing aggregations with avector search it is crucial that you dowhat's called limiting the search Spaceby setting an explicit limit orthreshold with the limit or distanceargument for exampleto further refine your aggregate queriesyou can use the group by argumentthis allows you to compile informationfrom multiple subsets results based onspecified propertiesthe aggregate function is a powerfultool that helps you to compile andinformation from multiple objectsyou can use it to gain an overview ofthe search results or even subsets ofresults whether by themselves or incomparison to the rest of the data setyou can use them with Vector searchparameters as well as filters whichyou'll learn about in the next sectionand remember that with aggregate queriesit is very important to limit searchspace with some sort of a thresholdthat's it for this video on aggregatequeries and waviatethanks for watching and we'll see yousoon", "type": "Video", "name": "Queries - Aggregate", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi3DG6XJkmA", "timestamp": "", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
