{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the 38th episode of the Weaviate podcast! This episode features Leo Boytsov, ... \nhey everyone thanks so much for watching \nthe wevia podcast I'm super excited to \nwelcome Leo boy stuff Leo is currently a \nsenior research scientist at AWS Labs uh \nprior to this he's written a \ndissertation at Carnegie Mellon \nUniversity titled efficient and accurate \nnon-metric k n surge with applications \nof text matching I started studying \nLeo's work after seeing some of his \ntweets that brought a ton of knowledge \nto the discussion around deep learning \nfor search technology and finally Leo's \nco-authored an incredible new work in \npairs light that I'm just super super \nexcited to dive into so firstly Leo \nthanks so much for joining the podcast \noh thank you very much for inviting me \num it's great to be here \nawesome so I think maybe setting the \nstage I really want to start with this \nin pairs light work I think this is so \ninteresting and maybe this background of \nas we think about the intersection of \nlarge language models and search \ntechnology I think most of us are sort \nof going in this direction of you sort \nof retrieve and read you use the search \nresults to uh to put into the context of \nthe language multi Granite generation \nbut this other idea of using the \nlanguage model to generate training data \nfor the you know for the search models I \nthink is so interesting so could you \nmaybe start by describing your interest \nin this \num yeah um if you don't mind a little \nbit of \num I would like to start with a little \nbit like historic uh background uh with \nuh retrieval maybe I I should say a \ncouple of words about retrieval in \ngeneral and also about \num the difficulty of applying uh machine \nlearning to retrieval and that has been \nlike historically so um the case \nof it what we usually what what we did \nbefore all the machine learning we had \nwe indexed uh text using uh inverted \nfiles which basically is your you know \nbook uh \nbook catalog for every keyword you you \nwill get like Pages where this this word \noccurs and uh the the biggest Advance \nwas the basically the bm25 function that \nwould \num tell you uh the score of of a page \nuh given how many times the the certain \nkeywords appear \nin in a page and that was a step big \nstep forward compared to the previous \nscoring function compared to Boolean \nsearch where you would have to specify \nall the words that need to appear and \nthat would experts would do so and that \nuh being qualify function was really a \nbig standard for quite a while and it \nwas difficult to beat even with machine \nlearning techniques because what \nhappened next like people figured out \nthat bm25 is a good \num good signal but there can be other \nones and then they um \nstarted to use machine learning uh \napproaches such as boosted regression \ntees to combine those and now the \nso-called learning to rank \num and that um in in somewhat \nregretfully in many cases it actually \nthat didn't help much and all like the \nuh whereas NLP was advancing at you know \nat you know rather rapid Pace in in \ninformation retrieval it was for a long \ntime it was not possible to be Beyond 25 \nor like slight \num you know slightly boosted Beyond 25. \nand and one reason and and there is \nactually a real reason for this in my \nopinion is that in NLP uh like say \nconsider something like a classification \ntask in NLP you look at the page and \nthere are like certain \nattributes of that page that indicative \nfor example of the sentiment right and \nthey're only typically or often they are \nonly attributes that are specific to \nthat page but when you're doing \nretrieval you need to look at uh at \nfeatures that \num that are query document features the \npairwise features and those features \nneed to be sufficiently generic so the \nit's it's often just not enough to look \nat oh oh this is like a trigram or \nbigram that that appears in the document \nor in the query \nit's often not enough \nunlike NLP so in in general there's like \nquery document \num similarity that has been historically \nmore difficult for machine learning \napproaches and another thing is I I \nguess that search is also much less \nprecise and much much noisier so it's \nharder to come up with this you know \nthere is bigger long tail so it's harder \nto uh come up with with some \nsome features that work for this in in \ngeneral and again that this is really uh \ndifferent from a lot of NLP tasks uh say \nlike uh question answering factoid \nquestion answering the rock use uh even \nbefore neural network uh these systems \nwere able to achieve a human level \nperformance like for example with ABM \nWatson system that did human Champion \nyeah \num I hope that's not not a very long \nintroduction but historically uh it was \ndifficult \nuh to beat simple bass lines and when uh \ndeep learning started to \nyou know \num to become very very popular in \num information table it's fair to say \nthat until we got bird \nwe didn't get any really good \nImprovement at least not in all the \ndomains \num over Beyond 25 and only with Bert \nwhich is relatively recent uh \ndevelopment we were able to beat \num bm25 like decisively \nyeah super interesting I think with my \npath in deep learning I also remember \nlike when I started deep learning the \nnatural language processing was mostly \nlike uh one-dimensional convolutional \nmodels but like before the Transformers \nthe Transformers just like busted open \nlike the Deep learning for natural \nlanguage processing so so could we \ncontinue on the cross encoders and the \nlearning to rank um just kind of maybe \nalso just the beginning of it being that \nthe cross encoders are high capacity \nclassifiers that take his input the \nquery in the document and then output a \nscore and so we use that score to \nre-rank it and you know the vector \nsearch will give us like a thousand or \nyou know however many results to begin \nwith and then we'll re-rank that to get \na higher quality list uh so can you sort \nof describe like cross encoders and then \nI know learning to rank and like the um \nusually you have like clicks to like \nuser data like XG boost models so it's \nlike a little different right to \nthinking between cross encoders and like \nmost of the XG boost style learning to \nrank stuff that's been developed \nuh yeah absolutely uh so first of all \num so when we say learning to rank \num although learning to rank is a very \ngeneric uh very generic uh term but \noftentimes when people say learning to \nrank they mean uh specifically that old \nstyle learning to rank when you have \nfeatures \nit can be pairwise features like uh the \nbm25 scores it can also be \num query specific or document specific \nfeatures such as like query type or like \ndocument quality score but these are \nfeatures so in the end you get a long \nVector of features and then you use \nsomething like boosted regression trees \nor it can be actually as simple as a \nlinear function \nbut that's \ncrucially on like on top of features \nthat are pre-computed somehow engineered \nand with the \num \nwith the invention of this strong neural \nnetwork models such as Transformer base \ncross encoders and buy encoders we were \nable to replace most of those at least \num most of those features with just this \nuh similarity score that comes from the \nneural model and it's also learning to \nrank of course but it's \num somewhat different from the the \nclassic learning to rank \nso the difference is um you you say that \nbm25 score maybe also like bm25f score \nas well as BM 25 score for the multiple \nproperties of some kind of object as \nwell as the vector distance score and \nuse those additional features in the \nre-ranking model compared to maybe these \nlike content only neural models that \njust is like query document more \nfine-grained kind of matching is that \nlike kind of an accurate description of \nthe sort of Distinction of it \nuh yeah I think it's a good one and it's \nstill possible to plug in Bird score \ninto the bigger model to but when our \nimpression that they say for for the the \nsay query document similarity only \npeople would use more sophisticated \nfeature-based model to achieve \nbirth-like performance but now you can \nreplace uh those with bird uh and in \nfact in terms of the query document \nsimilarity what I also used in the past \nand that's relatively unknown um \nsimilarity function is the so-called um \nmodel one \nuh and it is semantic in terms of in the \nsense that it can assign scores between \nquery document pairs that are not exact \nmatch \nand in some certain cases in particular \nfor question answering uh for uh if you \nretrieve document for a question \nanswering system it gives really big \nboost on top of Boom 25 which actually a \nfew people know but this is the case and \num it can improve BMW 24 upon 25 but you \nwould still need to do some fusion like \nsimple learning to rank \nuh and you can replace it now using \nbirth and typically get much better \nresults \nso I guess kind of the ending on \nreplacing it with bird is sort of where \nI where I'm hoping this is headed is \nthat these cross encoders can just sort \nof again like the query document is \ninput and kind of overcome needing to do \nall this feature Engineering in the \nlearning to rank that maybe just the \ncross encoders can re-rank by themselves \njust based on the based on a more \nfine-grained query document \nrepresentation and maybe we could um \nmaybe we could come back to the in Paris \nlight and how you how you train cross \nencoders for custom domains maybe talk \nabout the zero shot versus the in domain \ncross encoder in sort of that sort of \nDirection \nso uh yeah uh um sure so the uh as I \nsaid it can uh the the the cross encoder \ncan largely replace uh some pre-neural \nMachinery that was using the combination \nof features and for the cross encoder \nacross encoder and there are two types \nof neural models that we're using now \nbut they are both Transformer based but \nbasically cross encoder is a little bit \nmore accurate and it um you concatenate \nthe queries and documents and pass it \nthrough their \nmulti-layer a relatively large \nTransformer model which basically \nproduces your score \nusing a projection layer uh uh \nadditional projection layer and you \ntrain this model so these models are \npretty accurate \num there is also a buying color model uh \nwhere you encode queries and documents \nseparately and produce uh embeddings \nwhich you can compare using cosine \nsimilarity those models are somewhat \nless accurate uh but they permit a \nfaster retrieval because you can pick \nComputing beddings during the next time \nso these are two types of models and in \nterms of the um so those are great but \nthere is one problem so typically uh \nwell that's the perennial probably we \nneed training data for these models \nthese models are relatively especially \ncross encoders they're relatively data \nefficient but not like it's not like you \ncan train them on five examples we have \na paper where we uh evaluated the few \nshort properties for a number of \nCollections and yeah it's more like \num hundreds uh well if these are \nsparsely charged queries you need a few \nthousand maybe hundreds with um densely \njudged queries with a lot of relevance \njudgments per query then \num you can do few of them it's still a \nlot of data right and another problem is \nthat \num they are trained for a specific type \nof document you called domain for \nexample question answering over \nWikipedia and you try to transfer it to \nanother domain say legal documents and \noftentimes it just doesn't work so and \nwe it's not like a big discovery that \nthat was expected we uh we showed that \nthat was the case uh in in fact \nconcurrently with that uh uh now famous \nbeer paper \nuh then they did it also for they um \nthey did of course much more because \nthey showed that also for buying coders \nand what they showed that in fact cross \nencoders transfer beta then \nuh then \nthen buying quarters \num \nand I perhaps should clarify what we \nmean by transferring better Wars so in \nthe main mismatch and big problem with \nthe main mismatch is that it's not just \nperformance goes down it goes down so \nmuch that this wonderful neural models \nworking so well in the main they become \nworse than bm25 out of the main which is \nkind of ridiculous right it go it throws \nus back uh 15 years ago \nso \nyeah I think that in domain out of \ndomain there's definitely a lot to that \nthat we can unpack um but I guess kind \nof like this idea of having an in-domain \nmodel for your particular application \nlike um I kind of wonder about the zero \nshot and whether you need that like I \nthink it's a great thing to get started \nbut once you have some data set and you \nhave some queries for whether you're \nbuilding like a finance search app or a \nTwitter search app or like I'm working \non the webiate podcast search app so \nI'll search through this transcript \nright so like I I'm thinking like um you \nknow having I could use something like \nin pairs to generate my data set and \nthen train my cross encoder on that data \nset and then I can you know re-rank \nwithin domain and it kind of makes me \nwonder and it feels accessible to me \nbecause you know like these um cross \nencoders are like text classifiers maybe \nyou can shed some more insight onto the \ndifficulties of training cross encoders \nbut to me it seems like a you know not \nthe most complicated deep learning \noptimization task to train a text \nclassifier \nuh oh yeah uh training cross encoders \num I I love to train cross encoders and \nI hate to train buying coders I I did \nthe uh the cross encoders the um so the \ncross encoders versus buy encoder you \nprobably should have uh said talked more \na little bit about the advantages and \ndisadvantages of both types of models so \nfor cross encoders they are really easy \nto train but they are slow unless you're \nusing them in their ranking mode the \ngood news is that in many domains bm35 \nalready generates a list of candidates \nthat is pretty good and these models can \nbe some of these models can be pretty \ncheap to run with buying coders uh \nthey're difficult to train they converge \nreally poorly \num and they uh but they get the \nadvantage is that you can potentially uh \nyou know make ritual faster because you \ndon't \nmaybe need that re-ranking step or make \nit less necessary \nuh so yeah in terms of the but both \nmodels require a lot of data to train \num and what was ex it was difficult \nbefore this like this data typically \nneeds to be manually created and once \nagain another \num another difference between the NLP \ndomain and uh uh information table \ndomain so if you tell somebody like pick \na random NLP person and tell them that \nyou have difficulty annotating 1000 \nqueries then I was like oh like what's \nwhat's the big deal with a thousand \nqueries one thousand examples basically \nthat's kind of the light bulb that goes \non in the mind of uh your typical NLP \nresearcher but no no no you have to \nannotate the query what does it entail \nyou say for each query you run some \ncandidate generator or use a bunch of \nretrieval systems that produce results \nthe modern area they need to be diverse \nand then find some a bunch of documents \nand ideally you get like hundreds of \nthose some of those are going to be \nrelevant some of those gonna be \nnon-relevant and then an assessor or \nmaybe a couple of assessors those are \npeople who are judging um would go and \nread these documents at least briefly \nand for the 100 document \nso this is a normal salutation effort so \nI it's even if it's like really sparsely \njudged it's still like one thousand \nyou need to read a few thousand \ndocuments to not take one thousand quiz \nit's much more expensive so yeah the \ndata is a huge problem and zero shot \ndoesn't always work and moreover what's \ninteresting when the zero shot is \nworking well and that that result comes \nfrom \num from the great work of Rodrigo \nNigeria uh and some of his quarters that \nsome of the models they do transfer \nreally well but they typically need to \nbe large and not just large huge \nso something like 3 billion or 10 \nbillion parameter models we are not \ngoing to put those in production anytime \nsoon maybe not even within a couple of \ndecades so that that's that's a big big \nissue \num so ideally we wanna train models that \nare small so how do we get data and uh \nexcept entertaining it manually and then \nalthough there there was some work on \nself-supervised learning in the IR \ndomain but again things I would remember \nthings are more difficult than they are \nthe main it was much less uh for example \nthe contributor paper there was much and \nbefore that we had embeddings which are \ntypically much worse than being 25 like \naveraged in bearings um they are worse \nand unless that's a very specific some \ndomains in some domains they do these \nthings do work well but say not for Ms \nMarco not for legal ritual \num and yeah so those Excel supervised \napproach training approaches they \num don't work well and there was \nrecently there were a couple of exciting \npapers one coming uh from rodigo and his \ngroup called in pars and another was \nlike slightly preceding work UPR and \nshortly after that those propagated \npaper as a follow-up to eat parse and \nthese over three three papers that \nshowed Oh you can use a large language \nmodel to either generate uh training \ndata from \nsuccessfully or you can use \num llm directly as a pre-trained llm as \na re-ranker and that was the UPR paper \nthat um we also cite so so and obviously \nin person propagator they are much more \num \npractical in the sense that they instead \nof re-ranking using a large model they \nare basically using prompting \nprompt engineering to distill the \ninformation from the large language \nmodel to smaller ranker or retail model \nand that makes things much more \npractical \nyeah and I think there's lots of there's \ndefinitely a lot to unpack I think the \nthe distilling part I'm very interested \nin that and kind of different from the \nknowledge installation where you use the \nlarge model to label the data and then \nyou learn those labels the synthetic \ndata generation thing is a different \ncase where you just generate the data to \ndistill it like in the data space rather \nthan just like the pseudo labeling label \nspace but uh quickly it is you there's \none detail you mentioned that I really \nwanted to unpack a little more and about \nthe relevance judgments for training \ncross encoders and I know we have like \nthis ndcg metric where we say label the \nrelevance of documents and say like a \nscale like a three level scale like you \nknow this is a three this is a three \nthis is a three this is a two this is \none one one one zero zero right so um \nlike how important is that label like \nmultiple relevance labeling having \nlabeling multiple relevant documents per \nquery for the sake of training these \ncross encoders \noh um \nthat's more than one question \num \nso first of all it's uh it's great point \nthat the distillation through prompting \nthat was uh used in in-person \npromptegator is so much different from \nthe classic distillation through caled \nversions that we typically do uh \nand I would want to address this uh \nquestion first because uh it's I I think \nit's still it's there is work showing \nthat it may still be possible to do the \nmore standard uh distillation as well \nso the um the UPR paper \nthe um \nI I hope I not mispronounced the name \nlike by session at all uh what they \noriginally showed that they can re-rank \nusing a big model \nand uh the \nuh they have a follow-up paper where \nthey show that you can actually use \nscale diversions to distill that \nKnowledge from the main model to the uh \nto a smaller ranker \nso that seems to be possible too uh but \nanother uh yeah uh but what the the \npromptigator and imparts found \napparently so it's easier to use prompts \nto actually uh use prompting as as a \ngeneration of synthetic examples and \nsome sort of proxy for this \ninstallation of the knowledge well that \nsaid I think what's what's important I \nmean these are sort of technicalities \nbut what's important I think the one \nimportant \num piece of information one important \nInsight here is that \num \nwe have something to distill and that's \na really good question how this happens \nso I remember I mentioned before that \num IR is a difficult domain for machine \nlearning \nbecause well for many reasons in this \nquery document similarity features are \nharder to um \nto somehow for ML and before uh before \nall those exciting developments there \nwas a lot of \num work on unsupervised uh like dog to \ndeck style word to vaxton embeddings and \nthey don't work well \nand there were and one reason why they \ndidn't work well because they were \ntrained in \nself-supervised fashion without direct \nsupervision and we know that it didn't \nwork well for IR moreover it worked \nmostly mostly didn't work well and it \nworked really poorly so then Bert \nappeared at first people tried when Bert \nappeared bird if people probably people \nare familiar that with bird bird can \nthey provide embeddings for text as well \nalthough this embeddings well a lot of \npeople including actually Nils who was \non the podcast they quickly noticed that \nthose embeddings are not good for the \ntable for something like sentence \nretrieval yes you can use it but but \nquery to documentary doesn't work so \nself-supervision doesn't work \nuh then you would need a ton of \nsupervised data and buying coder which \nis like really tricky to train \nnow we have models that uh a trained \nusing self-supervision \nand now they work for ritual so \nsomething changed and and that that \nwasn't present before \nso and we don't know exactly what is it \nlike in scale of the data is it what uh \nis it the way how these models are \ntrained \nso yeah so that's um and that's why uh \nin in that's why for us in in parts \nlight paper \nwhich is in fact basically reproduction \npaper which is very incremental with \nrespect to that much more fundamental \nwork but we try to answer a couple of uh \nimportant questions such as can you make \nit even more practical and another \nquestion is \num is it really the scale just the scale \nof that next talking prediction training \nthat makes the model learn something \nabout IR as well which didn't happen \nbefore and to do so we need to take \num we need to use \na purely open source model like Bloom \nbecause we can trust that they train it \nlike this way and didn't find unit on \nany IR data sets or even something like \nIrish which cannot be we cannot be sure \nif you take gpt3 do you know how it was \ntrained no I don't know \nyeah I love those details of the paper \nlike the um the bloom seven billion the \nmaybe the GPT J model so these open \nsource language models to generate the \ntraining data which are also a little \nmore accessible because I think like \nwith the gbt3 da Vinci like at the \npricing of recording this podcast it's \nlike going to be probably like a cent \nper you know generation sort of around \nthat so you know 5 000 scaling it so it \nmakes it seems a lot uh very useful to \nbe testing if the smaller generative \nmodels can produce good synthetic data \nas well and then also the smaller \nrankers because in the end you use the \n30 million parameter uh mini LM \narchitecture based rank or model so I \nmaybe could we touch a little more about \nthe inference requirements of the \nrankers because uh well I guess these \njust just inference Topic in general the \nbecause like the rankers you know if you \nhave like a three billion parameter rank \nor you mentioned the log profit the \nlanguage model to get the score to \nre-rank that either in you're gonna be \nwaiting waiting for the re-ranking \nforever \noh yeah \num yeah so so basically uh like our \npaper although it did get some positive \nfeedback uh it's it's really uh it's \nreally very incremental reproduction \npaper but what I \nso so it was uh in fact not my main work \nproject it was a sidekick \num I supervise the team of Master \nstudents and and CMU and I was doing \nthings jointly with them not just \nsupervising them so they implemented in \nfact some key component how to generate \nthese synthetic queries and then I took \nthis and um I I ran I ran these \nexperiments most of the experiments and \nand yeah uh it's originally the question \nwas \nwas that yeah gpt3 is somewhat expensive \nso can we make it cheaper by using the \nopen source model but that's not not all \nthis story uh that's \num this is the part where uh Rodrigo no \nguerra's team with Bonifacio and all \nthat they scooped us a little bit \nbecause they showed in the follow-up \npaper yes you can replace gpt3 but what \nthey didn't try to do they didn't try to \nreplace the huge model with something \nthat is uh really much more practical \nand that's something that what we did so \nthe cross encoders they \num although they can have reasonable \nrequirements they can be applied on the \ninference times they can be applied only \nto um \nto like small subsets of documents so in \neven with the I don't remember inference \ntimes for a bigger model but even for \nlike 30 million \nparameter models on just with General \npytorch without much optimization it's \nsomething like \num \nI I think a few thousand documents per \nsecond on the modern GPU which which \nmeans you can't afford the ranking more \nthan like a couple hundreds documents \nreceived Say by pm45 \nand it's actually much worse if you try \nthe model that is 300 million parameters \nyou multiply it by 510 and another 10 \nmultiplier if you take the models that \nuh Rodrigo guerra's team was using with \nexhibition parameters probably also like \nfive times \nanother five times slower or something \nlike that uh \nyeah I think it'll be really great like \nuh sort of like blog post content around \nweediators getting these numbers out of \nlike how long it takes to re-rank a \nthousand 100 documents with with each \nparameter size uh Transformer based \ncross encoder uh yeah it's super \ninteresting because the the 30 million \nright it could re-rank it super fast and \nand uh else maybe because I think like \npeople are used to like I'd say like sub \n30 50 millisecond Vector search and bm25 \nsearch so uh because I I just like you \nsaid to rank a few thousand documents in \na second with a cross encoder because \nI'm just curious if I heard that detail \nright because with my experiments it's \nbeen to re-rank like a thousand \ndocuments and probably looking at like \nyou know 10 to 30 seconds \nuh Which models do you use I it's \nusually I'm using the sentence \nTransformers cross encoders and uh yeah \nmaybe like 80 million parameter scale \njust like uh testing it but uh yeah \nmaybe just for because I think I'm \nmissing a huge part of my knowledge now \nhow are you uh optimizing the cross \nencoders for inference \num I I didn't and I I think it may be uh \ndepended a little bit on the GPU that \nyou're using \num but for the uh for the for the 30 \nmillion parameter model that I I was \nusing I I did measure the times and it's \nfor 100 documents it's something like \n0.3 second \nfor a hundred \num yeah so the you can rank one thousand \nin some cases you probably would need to \ndo so and it's going to be \num more expensive but I think that in \nmany uh in many cases people deal with \nsmaller collections we are ranking 100 \nis enough and in fact that was one thing \nthat we changed between the when we did \nreproduction but that one thing that we \nchanged between in-parse paper and our \nreproduction is that they were ranking \nwith thousand documents we were ranking \n100 and with somewhat uh with somewhat \nbiggest model \nlike having like 400 million parameters \nwill basically match the numbers on most \ncollections we get in the neighborhood \nof day numbers while we're ranking only \n100 documents so this already shaves off \nuh an order of magnitude \nso \num and also another thing that going \nfrom \nuh 400 million to 30 million fundamental \nmodels is also much more uh efficient \nalthough the results are not as good so \nit's um an open research question \nsomewhat open the situation how to make \nit even more effective but \num \nwhat I should have mentioned before I \nthink it's it's a step forward it's not \ndefinitely not a solution of the problem \nuh what is a step forward in particular \nif you look at the paper over the king \nParts they use two models one is as big \nas our biggest Model A little bit and \nthe the same same order of magnitude \num 300 200 to 300 million parameters and \nwith that model they do not beat bm25 at \nall just except for Ms Marcos parse uh \nand the track so only on one collection \nthey can do it and we take a 30 million \nparameter model and we were able to \nconsistently outperform bm45 on all the \ncollections they were using so it's \ndefinitely step forward \num yeah so \num people are in pretty sure people will \noptimize this recipe even further and \nwe'll get some \nyeah I think like um because I haven't \ndone things like even just like you know \nmaybe just the Onyx optimizations the \nmaybe compiling into the Nvidia Triton \nserver and we're also really excited \nabout neural magic and the sparse \ninference acceleration all the kind of \nthings we can do to make here and faster \nand uh I also think kind of this topic \num like I think as we're thinking about \nthis retrieval augmented large language \nmodel thing you might be willing to wait \na little longer for the re-ranking also \nbecause you know you're going to pay for \nall these Generations so you know if \nyou're searching like \nlet's say I'm simulating my interview \nwith Leo and and I'm uh and I want and I \num and I'm and I want to like practice \nmy podcast and I'm talking about in \npairs light and I want it to retrieve \nsome passage and I have this big Corpus \nlike I'm willing to wait you know two \nmore seconds for it to get that top \nresult that will help supplement the \nlanguage model to ground the context and \nthen pretend to be Leo in my use of the \nlanguage model so yeah so maybe we could \ntalk about just this General space of \nretrieval augments that large language \nmodels sort of pivoting topics a bit \num I'm sorry I'm a little lost do you \nwant me to touch what kind of they \ndeveloped the topic of efficiency a \nlittle bit more or \nyeah if you're interested in doing that \nfor sure I I yeah sorry that was kind of \nit's like a Loosely tied together \ntransition but yeah this it's like I \nsigned I kind of see like the value of \nre-ranking is increasing with the large \nlanguage model \noh I see uh well first of all \num \nthe the ranking can be relatively cheap \nso that's that's again \num as you mentioned people sometimes \npeople can wait if you're doing an \nEnterprise search and something within \none second is probably uh a possibility \num so uh 30 million parameter model is \ndefinitely practical \nand um but you probably need still need \nto run it on some gpus device \nso something like I think there may be \nM1 uh hybrid CPU GPU \nprobably would be required \num or like pretty multi-core CPU um so \nthat's that's one thing but the second \nthing of course uh in \ncan be possible again uh combine it with \nthe retrievers as well I we didn't train \nretrievers \nbecause unlike in parse paper sorry \npropagated paper who trained retrievers \nand that can be if you train retriever \nwhat happens with the retriever \nretriever is like buying color model it \ncan be pretty accurate on its own yes \nevery ranker adds something on top of \nthat but usually like 10 15 so if you \nhave \num a \nretriever you can in Factory rank fewer \ncandidate records \nso instead of say 100 you'd rank on the \nlink \n30. so that's or instead of 1000 you \nwould rank 100 so that makes us a little \nbit more \num \nuh yeah more feasible and with \nretrievers you can invest more into like \nuse bigger models because you kind of \nshifted to the indexing time \nyeah so that's something to try uh and \nwith four four four \nyeah so um yeah so that's basically uh \nyou can wait a little bit longer you can \nuse buy encoders you can use slightly \nfaster Computing devices and you can use \na more optimized um environment \nand I'm not sure about the neural magic \nbecause I haven't uh played with it \nmyself but uh I know that it's like on \nsip on on the there are cheap gpus now \nlike what things that are like that are \ncomparable in speed total Titan and they \nhave some like \nthey're very cheap and and \nwhy not use them if they even cheaper \nthan maybe than CPU why not use them for \ninference \nyeah I think um just yeah on the neural \nmagic side of like it's like this \ncombination of things with like \nsparsifying the models lower Precision \ntaking advantage of like the CPU cache \nhierarchy uh if people are curious that \nwe have an interview with Michael Goin \nwho explains all the details of that uh \nbut uh yeah uh so yeah super cool and I \nthought that trade-off you mentioned was \nso interesting of the um of like how you \nwant to think about putting your \nresources towards optimizing the buy \nencoder like vector embedding models \nwith the cross encoder re-ranker models \nand how if you have really good buy \nencoders and you would only need to \nre-rank 30 and then you could have a \nhigher capacity re-ranker like three \nbillion parameters because you're only \nre-ranking 30 or or this other kind of \nthing where you're like we're going to \nthrow it all into the learning the rank \nkind of thinking where you're like let's \nget like a thousand from bm25 a thousand \nfrom Vector search and just into this 30 \nmillion parameter ranker which is like \nthe engine to fix it I that trade-off is \nsuper powerful I think \nyeah \num absolutely so you can in fact as I \nsaid uh the like old style IR can still \nget like in the in the case of QA \ncollection I'm I'm guilty I haven't \npublished that paper I should uh that \nshowing that actually really can get \nit's not only like Factory tool that \nthat can be helpful and uh yeah in the \nadvantage although there is some work \npublished on that but the games that I \nget there they are actually not that big \nI think you can \num can you can I should publish a more \ncompelling paper basically saying that \num \nyou can use bm25 it rank just like \nreally a lot of uh bm45 entries using \nold style Tech or like modernized old \nstyle tag which runs on CPU it runs fast \nand then it gives still you like almost \nalmost like close to that by encoder \nlike style quality and then you can use \nyour ranker and that said I'm not like \nparticularly attached to rankers in \ncells we had \num I think it was more for the paper \nitself it was more important to show \nthat you can't replace gpt3 and not only \nthat uh we got things \nfor their uh for the in-person paper \nauthors who big thanks uh twin Parts \npaper authors who uh released all their \ngenerated queries so we were able to \ndirectly compare regenerate sort of the \nsame using the same documents but using \nonly the generation was done using blue \nand gptj I think and we were able to \ncompare against the quality and we could \nsee that yes we we get results that are \nbetter than \nGPT 3 results \num so that was an important question and \nanswer the second question would we be \nable somehow get models that are much \nsmaller \num that was that was and again we got \nscooped in part in on both of these \nresearch questions by propagator paper \nor buying parse version two paper uh but \nI do think there is value to our \nfindings as well and it's also nice to \nhave like independent confirmation of of \nideas \nthat's for practitioners it's probably \nvery useful as a \nas a signal \nyeah that I love that idea of open \nsourcing uh the synthetic data sets like \nthe um you know I love hug and face \nmodel Hub is they mentioned like the \nopen source generative models being a \nhuge part of this and um like open \nsourcing the generated data set the the \ndata set Hub papers with data also has \nlike the collection of data sets yeah \nI've been so interested in wanting to \nparticipate in this kind of thinking \naround the science like we are working \non like the beer data sets and so I'm \nplanning on you know putting these in \nGoogle buckets and then you can restore \nweave it instances that have like the \nbm25 search the hnsw index already but \nthat like publishing of the like gbt3 \ngenerated synthetic data set to expand \nlike NF Corpus or you know the beer data \nsystem this kind of idea I find it so \ninteresting so so in the podcast I like \nto kind of like really transition topics \num can you tell me about like your sort \nof your origin story of how you came in \nto be working on search and then \nparticularly this non-metric space \noh yeah \num \nyeah so that that's a little bit the \nthis to my story is uh a little bit \nunusual if not to say it it's quite \nunusual because \num I'm not like your typical uh not your \ntypical researcher and uh so I I was \nworking in the industry for quite a \nwhile \num and then I I got my PhD basically \nvery recently \num mid-career \nbut one important reason why this \nhappened because the the country from \nwhich I originated it \nit stopped to exist and all these signs \nthat that wasn't that country to is \nbasically \nthere was no funding there was no way \nyou can go and get uh doing research and \nalthough the fundamental education like \nremained strong they're the only like \nopportunities were like go and you know \nwork on financial systems databases and \nthings like that \num but I got bored by this pretty \nquickly and um talking about how I can \nautomate this stuff like green creation \nand writing of SQL queries yeah this \nthis stuff is pretty repetitive so \nprobably a lot of that can be automated \nuh but anyways so I got of course I was \ninterested more like in research and at \nthe moment that was like basically late \nuh \nit was like 30 no it was a little bit \nmore than 20 years ago the the only like \nAI of which \num it was basic research and search \nengines there was a big topic that we we \nhad Google that you know \num and that's how I got interested in \nretrieval algorithms and I was uh doing \nthat that stuff part-time and at some \npoint like I talked with my family \nuh that they \num and they basically supported my \ndecision to go get like a formal degree \nbecause unfortunately in our society \nit's really hard if you don't come from \nnowhere you're not being treated \nseriously in yeah you will not just get \nlike good quarters yeah it's uh some \nthere are some stories of people \ngoing to I don't know some engineering \njob and then they emerge as researchers \nthere is one interesting case of uh \nof \num the author of Chain of Thought \nprompting that's an interesting story \nthey're interesting but they're rare \nvery rare cases that happens so \nbasically yeah um and that's how I got \ninterested in retrieval \num \nnot so I I didn't plan to work on \nretrieval while in my PhD program \nbut \nI joined a lab \num whose Pi like Eric nyberg was \nparticipating in that IBM Watson project \nand for me that was like super flashy \nand super AI beating human Champions but \nafter like reading and learning about \nthe topic what we quickly realized that \noh IBM Watson system is actually is not \nis is pretty simple \nit is basically a retrieval augmented \nmodel what we have now retrieval \naugmented NLP that's what it was the \nretrieval uh retrieval based QA system \nand that's how I came back to work a \nlittle bit more on the duo because I \ndecided that you can retrieve the you \ncan improve the the retrieval component \nthat's that will retrieve the perform \nimprove the performance of the whole \nsystem the okay system \nand now answering your question a little \nlong-winded explanation about how no \nmetrics such came into place so the the \nnon-metric we have like in \nin the real world we have distance which \nis euclidean distance and has a bunch of \nnice properties and it has satisfies \nthat actions of the metric space but \nthere are a bunch of similarity metrics \nso we don't normally call them distances \nwho are \nwrong they not do not satisfy our \nintuitions of the 3D world and they are \nnon-metric like they assigned similarity \nthe kale Divergence they're all but they \ncan still be useful because they're used \nas a \nsimilarity function to compare queries \nand documents and so the idea was \ncoming from that Old uh feature \nengineering world \nso you can compute that similarity you \nhave a data analyst that would compute \nuh that create this uh the features \ncombine them and that would be some \ncombination that would not be nice and \nyou would need a special kind of system \nthat would uh support retrieval using \nthis similarity function \nso sorry I'm still trying to wrap my \nhead around it so it's like a learned \nfunction for the for the distance \nbecause that sounds a lot like the cross \nencoder to me uh I I know that sounds \nlike really alien to people because \nnowadays \nin like recent years we made a huge \nprogress in representation learning so \nbasically you can compute very good \nrepresentations and compare them using \nthe euclidean distance \nor they can sign similarity between \nnormalized representation is basically \nthe euclidean distance \nuh and that's all you need it's just \neverything else like neural network \num \njob to make this representation \ncomparable using a simple similarity \nmeasure but in the old days uh people \nwould \ncreate multiple features \nand the idea was that oh \nso these multiple features there will be \ncomplex function people were \ncontemplating \nsome expensive similarities \nsomething like Earth Mover distance \nwhich is really inefficient to compute \nbut people like like there is a paper \nI think there that's using uh this earth \nmover distance to compute more than \nbearings with some small gains \nalthough Earth more resistance I think \nit's still metric but you want some some \nsystem that what it's it's a geogenetic \nmetric it's much harder to do \nretrievable with this generic metric \nbecause it's not euclidean so it's not \neven like vector space distance \nso there was that idea that all that's \nuh let's help analysts by building \nproviding them with tools that would \nsupport retrieval using these \ncomplicated similarity measures \nyeah so I remember studying like uh \nwasserstein Gan where they you use like \nthat Earth mover's distance \num do you mind explaining that from the \nbeginning what what the difference is \nbetween Earth movers distance and this \nis like Optimal transport like what the \ndifference is between that and then just \nlike a KL Divergence between vectors \num I have to tell you that I don't \nremember a very specific nuances of how \nEarth what was distances calculated \nbut \num as far as I remember \nit is not it is not represented you \ncannot represented by something like \ntake Vector coordinates just like \ncompare them like in the euclidean \ndistance you can't just you have a bunch \nof simple distances the euclidean \ndistance the lp Matrix \nand the decay of the versions they're \nstill pretty simple because you just \ncompare uh pairwise you do pairwise \ncoordinate comparisons comparisons like \nI quote unquote because you do some \noperations like either you subtract them \non square or I can kill the versions \nit's a little bit more involved but \nbasically it is a pairwise operations \nwhich are often that you just can \nsimulate why are the inner product \ncomputation and then it's a simple \niteration in the vector space \nbut in a more generic uh way you can \nconsider generic vectors not a vectors \nby generic space that doesn't have a \nnotion of this \nsimple vectors \nor they are not compared so easily \nbut they still they would space in \nschool could be called something like a \nmetric space \nand \num it would have some actions in \nparticular metric space satisfies the \ntriangle inequality symmetry \nand you might be you might Envision \nsearching in this space without using \nvectors directly just distance \ncomputations \num \nyeah think about it like um I don't have \nlike a piece of paper on the desk but \nlike I crumble up a piece of paper and \nthat's kind of how I think about like \nwhat a manifold is like a discrete \ntopological structure where you can't \nyou can't let or you know my hand right \nnow is a manifold like I can't do \ndistance from here to here because this \ndoesn't exist sort of a sort of like \nhave been thinking about that kind of \nthing but uh yeah maybe I know it's \ngetting a little distract a little off \ntopic but do you do you have an interest \nin things like category Theory and these \nkind of topics \num not really familiar but I think the \nthe manifold example is interesting in \nthat \num it's a good illustration that you can \nreason about this space in abstract ways \nlike you have some certain restrictions \nyou can go from here to here but not \nfrom here from another point but at the \nsame time you don't reason in terms of \nexplicitly in terms of coordinates \nand that makes a huge difference in \nterms of the search function because \nyour search function is going to be \nrestricted the you have less information \nabout the space \nand that's that's going to be big \nrestrictions but what's interesting \num that there wasn't that that uh \nsequence not sequence of uh there is \nthat uh \na class of algorithms that rely on \nbuilding neighborhood graphs \nwhich surprisingly uh people realized \ngradually that those algorithms are are \nsufficiently generic \nto provide a retrieval in in the case \nwhere you don't have those explicit \nVector space coordinates and not only \nthat they can oftentimes beat those uh \nalgorithms that I designed uh \nspecifically for this knowing like \nhaving this coordinate system and access \nto individual coordinates \nand they can be so we have that \num yeah and once once I realized that I \ncould use this kind of algorithms and I \nI I saw the research opportunity which \nended uh in the that was a dead end to a \nlarge degree unfortunately but it may be \nuseful in the future and we also helped \nuh helped promote these approaches which \nwere also super useful for \nuh distances like the euclidean distance \nas well as for inner product search and \ncosine similarity bases \nyeah it's amazing I I think the whole \nlike graph representation learning which \nis usually like let's try to get the \ngraph into a continuous space let's try \nto get the graph into a euclidean space \nso we can like do all these things I I \nalso find it so fascinating the the hsw \nlike the the graph index that's paired \nwith the way that you organize the \neuclidean space distance measures do you \nthink uh yeah I I don't have like \nanything super conquer I'm just kind of \nlike thinking out loud with this but \nyeah so interesting so can we also talk \nabout um so you developed this the flex \nNewark Library you've built the hsw lib \nand uh nmslib uh can you tell me about \nyour experience developing a library to \norganize your experiments and \ncommunicate your research this way \num yeah absolutely well first of all I'm \nwasn't like the only the the person \nworking on this and then \num the that with respect to that graph \nbased retrieval algorithms I I helped to \npromote it I was I \ncreated the first optimized version of \nthat that \num to some degree was was reused but \nthen we of course take our most \nefficient implementation was contributed \nby Yuri malkov uh but more generally \num that project was uh in terms of \norganization of the the the the research \nit's actually quite interesting that \nthis project started as the PHD project \nof \num another person Billy naidan who also \ncontributed quite a lot to it \num \nand at some point like everybody's using \nthe python version python biting he \ncreated the first python bitings you \ncan't it wouldn't have been possible to \ndo anything useful without python \nbindings \num yeah but that that started as his PhD \nproject and we had no uh graph \nalgorithms at that point uh these were \nhis interest wasn't this retrieval and \ngeneric metric spaces so we did a little \nbit of of work on this topic and it was \nbasically two of us \num and then we had a couple more people \njoining our the project so it was like \nyou know like sort of random alignment \nof people on the interests and uh \num and their contributions and I was \nkind of holding that um I'm a sleep \nproject together \nso uh doing actually a lot of uh the \nsoftware engineering job the uh some of \nthe running some of the experiments on \nthe published uh a couple of papers of \nthat non-metric search \nand also maintaining it and it's \num yeah doing things like that basically \neven like encouraging people to to \ncontribute although it wasn't a big \nproject it was a small collaboration it \nwas a little bit it is actually a little \nbit different with a flexnard because \nflex No Art is \num the retrieval toolkit that uh is \nbasically separate from animal sleep and \nit's just incorporates all the the good \nstuff like bm25 and Keenan and search \nand that was solely at some point it was \nlike 100 my project and what I'm trying \nto do I'm I work with people and \nwhatever we do jointly for the \ninformation tool we trying to \num reuse this library and I also like I \nit it actually started it it started as \nfrom it comes from my PhD this is so I \nused it \nand I you know it's like I improved a \nlittle bit and a little bit and then a \nlittle bit more and then \num it becomes more useful with time \nyeah it's really interesting and I I \nwould think that like waviate could be \nused for a lot of this IR research as \nwell where you could you know you have \nthe you can build off the implementation \nof hsw product quantization like as disc \na n is developed and these kind of \nthings and I guess like my thinking is \nlike the library it adds value and \nsometimes they have like the data sets \nare built in so like some of these IR \ndata sets is really easy to load the \ndata because you don't have to clean it \nit's already clean and sort of a part of \nthe library as well as these indexing \nalgorithms and sort of like the whole \nranking flow \nyes I guess like um what do you think \nare the this might be too open-ended of \na question but like what are the most \nimportant things for an information \nretrieval research library to contribute \nto the science to you know be used \noh that that's uh that's that's a great \nquestion and that's a very open-ended \none I don't have definitive answers so \nthe uh I think the animal sleep \ndefinitely uh was useful and that's kind \nof funny because I I don't have a key \ncontribution that library and it's still \nuh wouldn't have existed without me or \nlike the league and then \num one thing that it should be useful in \nsome ways it should uh there should be \nsome missing elements like an animal \nsleep we had methods that uh before us \nnobody was or like few people \nuh seriously considered them as \num \nas you know something to be used \num that's like one missing missing piece \nof science it's \nanother thing is the ease of use and I \nthink say within Amazon sleep we um we \nwere able to largely to a large degree \nachieve this so first the Billy created \nthis Python bitings and then I got help \nfrom another person to make it like you \nknow deployment easy and installation on \num \ncomputers that you don't have to compile \nyou'll get some pre-compiled binary \ndefinitely ease of use you just do \nPipeline and also on a bunch of \noperating systems ease of use definitely \nit should be it should should be no pain \nfor people to install \num the it was great point about \ndownloading data sets and I personally \nunderestimated this part for a while and \nflexnorth doesn't have this ability but \nI see what pi syrini is doing and I \ndefinitely want to appeal for that for \nthem from them I don't want to support a \nlot of data sets \num because it's like you know it's \ndifficult but like basically I say I \nwant to convert beer data sets and Ms \nMarco and store it in the cloud so \npeople when they use flex not and say \nbm45 indexes from flexnor they can just \nbasically run a command and then it will \ndownload things as well \nso what else instead of like years of \nuse it should it shouldn't it should be \nyeah somehow uh it should have some \nthere should be some missing is some \nmissing piece of science or technology \nthat \nthat people need and and last but not \nleast I think I should have said that \nmaybe earlier \num promotion makes a huge difference \nyeah so people should know you should \njust \nwriting something beautiful and putting \nit out on GitHub nobody knows uh \nsometimes Word of Mouth works but you \nknow you compete with Google and \nFacebook and the others whenever like \nyou get good results from some \nleaderboards you publish papers you \nthen people \nyou know get people interested so that's \nI think an important component too \nyeah super interesting I think to build \non the data sets part you've done some \nwork on Long document uh benchmarks and \nI I think this is a very interesting \ntopic that hasn't really been covered \nlike if we're gonna rank you know if \nwe're going to search through entire \nscientific papers sort of can you sort \nof just like set the stage of of the \ndistinction and long document and sort \nof how this hasn't been studied as much \nas you know Ms Marco natural questions \nlike that whole tour of the beer data \nsets yeah so that's \num that's that's a great question that's \nactually one of the uh important \nlimitations of the Transformer models \nwhich are currently I feel is being \nremoved now at least like mitigated but \noriginally the the way the birth was \ncreated it had to um it still has if you \nuse that original birth model it has a \nlimit on the number of input tokens it \ncould process and it's only 512. and \nit's not a whole lot right so and if you \nhave a long document you need to \nclassify it or you have to do something \nand there is a bunch of algorithms that \nare doing some sort of clever chunking \naggregation of results and \num that's uh that was something to \nBenchmark and \num compare for the paper \num that said I feel like the community \nhas made a really great progress on \nremoving that limitation \nand with approaches like flash attention \nI think we'll soon have uh \nTransformer models that will support \nvery long inputs up to a few thousand a \nfew thousand more than 10 000 tokings \num it's I think it's a matter of time \nbut it should happen \nyeah I think there's kind of like um \nmaybe \num yeah so that that idea of like flash \nattention I've seen like staircase \nattention I I went to neurops this year \nand I saw a lot of the posters are like \nhere's our sparse Attention our take on \nSports attention right it's like this \nlinear attention kind of technique and \nand I certainly agree like things like \nthe Sarah Bros chip as being one like \nbig chips that get that like you put in \nmassive inputs to the Transformers that \nI find that whole thing to be incredibly \ninteresting but maybe if I could pitch \nyou this other idea on what we're \nthinking with uh with a long document \nrepresentation where like our so our \nweva data model is like classes and then \nlike references to other classes so we \nthink about it like article has passage \npassage and so like article has passage \npassage passage passage passage and then \num and so one way would be to represent \nthe whole article you would have the \nvectors of each chunk and then you would \naverage the vectors from the chunk to \nrepresent the article another idea would \nbe maybe we like cluster the uh passages \nand then we have like three centroids \nthat represent the article and then a \nnewer idea with chat gbt expensive but \nit could it's an idea is that you would \nuh you would you would say like please \nsummarize these passages so like you you \ngo one by one through the passages and \nthen update the summary and then from \nthat represents the article so what do \nyou think about that kind of like graph \nstructured way of representing like \nabstract long document object with these \nchunks \noh yeah um there is definitely a bunch \nof way how to uh chunk data and \naggregate it and represent in the this \nphase I am I have to tell you that I \nhave to I have to give a disclaimer that \nI'm not particularly \na knowledgeable person in in for this \nkind of work uh in yeah basically I did \nwork in the domain much \nuh but it's my yeah you can do \ninteresting things you can do embeddings \nand then you can do something probably \nlike graph neural network based on top \nof that again how well it works I can't \ntell uh but \num I I can tell you that there are \ndefinitely efficiency issues because \nwhat we see a lot of times that uh \nthings that work best are trained end to \nend meaning that like you you say you \nhave a graph you have like embedding for \neach node you embed it and basically \nyour neural you feed a large chunk or \nlike the whole graph sort of into you \nlike the whole document \nor the graph of the document into that \nneural network \nand then embedding the being although \nembeddings might be somewhat to be \ncomputed warmed up but in the end you \nwant to run this end-to-end compute \ngradients propagate them all the way \nthrough the network because if you don't \ndo this your your representations you \ndon't know how good they are right like \ncoming back to that example to bird \nwhich is Trend in self-supervised \nfashion but whose representations are \nnot good enough for retrieval so it can \nbe something like that and then you need \nand then fine-tune the whole uh thing \nagain and that's expensive \nso the the modern accelerators they \ndon't have enough memory for long \ndocuments so that's that's one \nlimitations that I would I would think \nof and then you can be clever and \nsomehow split um but how well it works I \ncannot comment because I don't have \nfirst-hand experience \nyeah that's a that's a such an \ninteresting topic because the graph \nneural networks to me like the big \nappeal of it is how well it can handle \nuh like variable size inputs so like one \narticle might have five passages the \nnext has like 30 and then the graph \nneural network I think like the \nend-to-end thing \nit's very like in the graph neural \nnetwork sense to stay on that I think it \nwould be like you update the original \nlike you send gradients all the way back \nto the input would be maybe how you \nwould try to do it end to end and you \nget like new embeddings that way sort of \nthat are synced up with like the context \nof the graph but yeah but but then you \nlike I find it very hard to believe that \nthere will be like zero shot graph \nneural networks that that like represent \nAggregates of embeddings for long \ndocument representations like I think \nyou'd need to train this on your \nparticular uh thing \noh I I totally I totally agree with you \nthat we \num the there is a relatively poor \ntransferability of neural networks to \nnew domain and tasks and although uh \nopenai made some great progress on in \nsome domains like with a clip model \nuh but I think it's still you know \nbecause we uh \noftentimes it's still like really \ndifficult in many practical situations \nto do this transformation although there \nwill be some progress there was it's \nit's an interesting topic and it's a \ncomplicated one and I again I have to \nI can only I I should probably repeat \nthe disclaimer that I'm \num that's that's not that's not my you \nknow uh it's not my primary expertise \nthis more structured objects regretfully \nso I cannot tell you what works and what \nwhat not what doesn't work in this uh \nspace \nyeah I think it's a pretty Cutting Edge \ntopic from my understanding I know there \nare definitely some graph neural \nnetworks uh experts out there in the \nworld but um I think this is a good like \nnot leaving the graph neural network \nthing in the past talking about the um \nthe in-domain out of domain so you know \nwe're kind of talking about like this \nidea that you if you want to have a \ngraph neural network that can represent \nlike your cross-reference schema you \nwould need to fine tune it in domain on \nyour problem and one of the big \narguments around out of domain in domain \none of the key things to be mindful of \nis robustness this topic of like robust \ngeneralization the out of domain models \nbeing really good at being robust \nrelative to in domain like there's this \ngreat paper called wiseft where they \ntake the clip model off the shelf that's \ntrained on something like Leon I don't \nthink it's I don't think the clip data \nset is open source as far as I'm aware \nuh and they fine tune it for particular \nimage Text data sets and they show that \nlike you know like the out of domain \nmodel is more robust so uh lee I know \nyou've done some work on awesomeness can \nyou sort of explain what robustness \nrobust generalization is \noh yeah sure so the uh well first of all \nwhen we talk about robustness we uh \ntypically separate uh it into natural \nrobustness in adversarial robustness and \nwhat I worked more on was uh actually \nadversera Boston's although we did some \nwork on the um \nnational uh natural generalization of \nnatural robustness for the information \ntool too but basically the the ID is is \nvery simple and I think you explain it \nit really well those very good examples \nso you take it something that is trained \nfor one type of data we call it domain \nand apply it to another type of data \nwhich is another domain and things don't \nwork as well and we call it distribution \nshift although there is no real \ndistribution and some people like oh \nlike what's distribution here but it's a \nit's a common terminology we somehow \nenvisioned a probabilistic data \ngeneration process that generated data \nin one domain generated data in another \ndomain and in fact there may be some \nbecause how is sample is is a generative \nprocess and then there is some some \nmismatch between properties and because \nour algorithms are statistical so if \nthere is difference in statistics \nbetween these domains it's sort of \ninevitable that you would um you would \nget this \num differences \nand with adversarial or business we \nwanna it's actually really I think it's \nprobably going to be \num \nit's not it's going to be a little bit \non off topic uh because with the reserve \nrobustness we assume that a malicious \nusers can modify inputs in a way that \nwould completely \nchange model prediction in a way that \nyou want it it's a it's a very huge \nproblem in in like academically \nand it's not there are no easy ways to \nsolve it apparently but I think it's \nactually doesn't um it's not clear if it \nhas a big um practical impact because \nit's difficult to attack these models in \npractice it's easy in the digital domain \nbut you never know the model you you \ncan't usually control the inputs at the \nsay pixel level or so it's difficult \num and with text you don't have access \nto gradients because that's \ndiscrete discrete thing but I think the \nnatural robustness is is a much more \nimportant topic for everybody \noh \nthat's your robustness of the \ndistribution shift is something that we \nshould really care about at least in the \nnear future \nawesome sorry there's a bit of a lag in \nthe connection but it's all back \ntogether yeah awesome yeah I I like this \nexample of like it's like they have the \nself-driving car and it's like oh no an \nadversarial optimized stop sign like \nthat kind of like you look at like the \nthe brain of the network to optimize \nwith gradients some kind of \nimperceptible thing yeah I also don't am \nnot super interested in that but I'm \ninterested in the general thing of like \nif uh like say you want to test the \nrobustness of your Tech search system by \nuh generating paraphrases of the queries \nand seeing if the paraphrase of the \nquery returns like far different search \nresults than the original query or like \nthe image analog would be you have like \nan image and you rotate it or you \nhorizontally flip it increase the \nbrightness these kind of augmentations \nand that produces like totally different \nsearch results so how do you see \nrobustness uh impacting search \noh \num that's yeah that's definitely great \nquestion and the I do see robustness uh \nbeing a huge topic for neural networks \nbecause uh it will frustrate users who \ndo not understand why exactly why they \nchange the inputs a little bit and that \nwould break systems and I and I'm pretty \nsure that all those systems are \nbreakable there is no easy solution what \nuh that I am aware of and I think to \nthings that work \nuh somewhat reliably \nin as was demonstrated it's it's another \nyou know talking about there is that \nconcept of Peter peel and machine \nlearning that no matter how smart we are \njust bigger models and and more data \nhelps us so I think in terms of \nrobustness it's probably \num we need again the the Practical sort \nof the the only practical uh remedies \nthat we have now are train more generic \nmodels on more data that's what open AI \ndoing and train models that are bigger \nand of course both Solutions have \npractical limitations too so \nyeah like one idea I'm sort of \ninterested in like is um the bm25 vector \nsearch Hybrid search is that more robust \nnow because I think of like the sort of \nsymbolic lexical search being more \nrobust and then so like on that layer \nand running some experiments to try to \nlike as I'm still getting the beer data \nsets and we've almost finished and then \nI'll be able to do these kind of \nexperiments and then also I think with \nthe ranking layer like um maybe you can \nhave like you you use the same rank \nFusion you use in hybrid search to have \nsome kind of symbolic like clicks or \nsomething like that where you where you \nhave a sort as well as the you know \nneural re-ranking in the new rank fuse \nthose to maybe improve the robustness on \nsort of those two layers \noh yeah absolutely so um \nso yeah so again uh I perhaps I should \nhave mentioned that that some sort of \nensembling usually improves robustness 2 \nand that's your classic result that \nEnsemble can produce both variants and \nbias \nuh in particular variants so someone \nsampling in particular like diverse \napproaches using diverse approaches can \nwork well uh although the information \nthat's again the example shows how \nunique the information in triple domain \nis so look we are like it's 2023 neural \nnetwork Revolution after imagenet it's a \ndecade in Inspirations he will we still \nuse build 45 because we we have hybrid \nsystems now we still need Bill 45. okay \nso that's difficult uh definitely tells \nabout the uh the difficulty of the \nretrieval domain and \nso one problem \num uh like providing a kind of more \nspecific answer to your question so \nFusion is definitely one way to go uh \nthen um \nthere is a problem with fusion though \nthe you you get bm35 and get results \nfrom build 45 you get results from a \ncross encoder or buy encoder and you get \nscores of course and their scores are \nnot comparable so how do you fuse them \nthat's yeah so like you can do that \nround robin right then \num but the problem with round robin is \nthat if you have systems that are very \ndifferent in terms of the effectiveness \nyou may end up like injecting very bad \nbm25 results into very good uh and the \nother way around \num yeah uh but there are also other \nSolutions uh probably we can come up \nwith the models that are somewhat more \nrobust in particular cross encoders are \nmore robust than buy encoders so you \ncan't to some degree if you're rank with \nthe cross encoder that's actually one \nadvantage that I could have uh recalled \nwhen I asked me why I use cross encoders \nuh Crossing quarters are somehow more \nrobust like \num uh yeah so this that's what takura \nand and \nquarters uh founded a beer paper \nthat's actually great and maybe there \nare other models that are \nusing maybe lexical \nClues and other signals kind of combine \nit together maybe more robust \nthan just when you look awesome colors \nto \num \nyeah I have to pick your brain a little \nmore on the um on the rank fusion part \nbecause I've had so many conversations \nabout this score based Fusion versus \nrank based Fusion that I'd really love \nto get your take on this as well um so \nyeah so if you so like if alpha alpha is \nthe parameter that determines how you \ncombine the ranked list of bm25 and \nVector search and then like 0.5 means \nequal contribution uh so so with tuning \nthe alpha parameter if we tune the alpha \nparameter of like say on beer like we're \ngoing here it is from zero to one point \none point two like is is that bad \nmachine learning because you know you're \nkind of you're kind of tuning a hyper \nparameter on the test set \nmaybe you could you start with your \nthoughts on that idea oh it's a little \nbit change of topics so there's maybe uh \nuh I I want to make it like um sorry I \nwant to make such the stage for this \nbecause I think we jumped to uh quickly \nso as we talked before about different \nsystems let's consider two just to \nproducing different kind of scores that \nare incomparable between 25 and say \ncross encoder and one one approach to \ncombine those just do like Crown Robin \nuh like for one like basically mix them \nin the order of uh \narriving but another approach is to \ncompute the linear combination of this \ncourse and it can be potentially better \nuh but there are two issues one issue is \nthat you may lose some of the Beyond 25 \nresults of the good because they will be \npushed down the total score is not going \nto be but maybe it's not such a big \nproblem but uh another problem is that \nyou need to have that Alpha coefficient \nuh the fusion and how do we choose it \nwell ideally we choose that coefficient \non the um \ntraining set but we have a beer data set \nwhich is does not does not have a proper \ndevelopment set and people want to uh \nwant to claim say uh \nhigh scores on beer because that \nattracts like basically as an \nadvertisement of the system and their \napproaches so if you are like I'll gonna \nbe very straightforward if you just fine \ntune Alpha on that \nfull beer data set \num it's it's gonna be an upper Bound for \nyour system performance but you can't \nclaim that it is achievable \nlike it may or may not be because you \nmay just overfeed it's not such a huge \ndata set right it may be maybe maybe \nyou're just overfitting if you you for \nexample uh you at some point you decide \nto double the number of entries in the \nbeer collection \nimage data set imagine like we somehow \nfind a more track covet documents and \nqueries and expand it and it will stop \nworking it just don't know so it's not \nlike a good way to say this in general \nis what I think would be fair to do is \nto do some sort of cross validation for \nexample uh divide each test set into \nfive \ncompute that Alpha on that \nand then test on the remaining parts and \nthen it would uh would tell you like oh \nlike this is going to be more \num robust more fair estimate of how you \ncan perform on the data set in a few \nshort settings say or something like \nthat \nyeah it's so interesting I I also had \nthat like let's see what the upper bound \nwould be on a conditional Alpha where \nfor each uh query we go through the \nwhole list and then see which one \nperformed best and then like as a quick \nlike kind of hand wavy thing like on the \nNF Corpus I was seeing hits at one go \nfrom like 1400 to 1800 out of 3200 doing \nthat just is like a quick sense of what \nyou can get from that but I that other \nidea of like you've trained some model \nor or a linear combination or some \noptimization of the bm25 score and the \nvector search score or the cross encoder \nscore uh and then as you mentioned but \nthen you those scores could shift I \nguess you normalize them with like it's \nlike the max BM 25 score over the \nminimum BM 25 score you know do that \nkind of thing um yeah I think it's very \ninteresting because like if you had like \na like a query classifier that like \ntakes this query and classifies how to \nweight the bm25 and the neuro like how \nto weight the lexical neural methods \nyeah I find that whole thing to be very \ninteresting even though I don't \nuh yeah it's it's I because I usually \nthink of the Cross encoder as like a \nstage one stage two thing where whatever \nthe cross encoder says is the output is \nthe final right list where yeah \nyeah so it's really interesting this \nkind of high research thing and I think \nall these yeah it's such an interesting \ntopic um so anyways uh I think it's a \ngreat coverage of topics that Leo do you \nhave anything else you want to maybe add \nI just want to quickly follow up on your \num \non New York uh \nor the problems that you described \nbecause that's something is indeed is a \nproblem with fusing this course yeah we \ncan compute the linear combination of \nthis course but other like these scores \nactually properly normalized there is a \npotentially huge variability across \nqueries we just don't know in in in in \npossibly we don't want to use the the \nlinear model you want to use something \nlike gbrt right boosted regression trees \nand in fact that's uh one way to go you \nneed a lot of data for this uh that said \nin practice for like small domains like \nMs Marco I played a lot of this when I \nespecially uh when I was active on that \nleaderboard in the \nearly stages when I was uh and I trained \na really strong uh \nPuri like classic IR model for this and \nI play for the MS Marco document \nleaderboard and I played a lot with like \nfusing different scores from different \ncomponents and I had two options to use \none is linear fusion and another using \nthis non-linear GB model and uh and I \nonly in one case I was able to get uh \nsomewhat \num noticeable \nperformance boost on top of the linear \nmodel so yeah so linear works well \num although with the caveat that that's \nwithin a single domain \nand once you go out of domain you're not \nonly \nthis coefficient maybe make efficient \nmaybe become like known invalid not \nappropriate and the audio scores may \nchange like a normalization confusions \nmay need to change for another domain \nit's it's really \num I I think robustness is going to be \nlike really huge topic for the coming \nyears yes more data and more \nmore everything will help but it also \ncomes with the efficiency cost and \neventually would want to run these \nmodels maybe only even on your phone \nyeah so it's uh it would have to be \nsuper efficiency \nyeah yeah it inspires a lot of thought \non like if you have this yeah it's like \na very tuned system for this domain of \ndata uh because you not only have the \nembeddings that come from maybe a \nparticular like if that's if you \nfine-tune your embedding model on your \ndomain and then you have the rank Fusion \nis a fine-tuned parameter for your data \nthe cross encoder maybe also is \nfine-tuned for your data and then that \ndomain shift maybe like don't like uh \ndistribution shift detection I I'm not \nlike super caught up with those methods \nbut maybe that kind of thing could help \nuh like you know like maybe the idea of \nyou in the vector space you cluster it \nin like hdb scan can like do a good job \nof telling you like this is an outlier \npoint in your vector space kind of \nyou know that kind of thinking uh yeah \njust \noh yeah \num uh that's that's Again The Good The \nGood the good reminder that the there is \nalso the difference between more like \nkind of academic style of \num \nthe machine learning where you just \ncompute an average score and be done and \nthe data scientists who work more like a \nreal problem they care much more about \noutliers they care much more about the \nwhat sort of the what's in the data and \nwhat's like specific results for the \nspecific they dive much deeper and they \ncare about like the the whole Spectrum \nyeah but anyways so I I think it's a \ndifficult problem uh I'm I I can't I \ndon't have a \nunfortunately I have to admit that my \ncrystal ball is not good enough I made a \nlot of mistakes about what things are \ngoing to be in the future so that's why \nI don't want to even make any like \npredictions maybe the scale will do a \ngood job for us although we will have to \nbe efficient uh although it may not do \nmuch more beyond what we um \nwe see already but it's hard to predict \nbecause it all those things there is no \nTheory it's just like your intuition it \ncan be wrong mind was wrong many times \nso I don't want to make this prediction \nabout things that are not uh clear \nbut I'm pretty sure that it's become \nit's not even like it's become very \nclear that the the Deep learning the the \nlanguage modeling the generative models \nit's there is no slowdown there is no \nlike winter per se some may be going \ndown in terms of like I don't know \nfinances some layoffs no but it's not \nlike a real winter some a little chill \nbut that's a huge topic it's probably \nthe area to be in the only thing that I \ndon't want to be really narrow IR \nresearcher I think it's probably \num worth \ntrying to be kind of more generic and \nkeep an eye on several sub problem \nseveral sub-domains so that's that's \nprobably \num what I I could recommend personally \nas \nas a researcher and engineer \nyeah I think that's really great advice \nas well again I think it can be kind of \noverwhelming trying to keep a tab on \nlike all the all the little subtopics \noh yeah uh somebody uh somebody use like \nis quite like really really great uh \nterm for this it's uh \nit's breakthrough fatigue \nnothing less that breakthrough fatigue \nso in the old days like IBM where they \nchess playing machine IBM with the you \nknow beating human champions in Jeopardy \nand that happened with like you know \nfive to ten years yeah and now like we \nbeat humans and go we beat humans in \nthis and then like our pH systems are \nsuper human kinda and the chat GPT is \ndoing so much stuff oh it can't do math \nyet but I don't know maybe like tomorrow \nit will be able to do math too so and \nhow soon will it happen you never know \nand those things that not only just like \ngreat papers but all those uh superhuman \nclaims of superhuman performance their \ndensity in time is just like really uh \nyeah you can get a fatigue from just \nfollowing all that stuff let alone \nworking on on any problems and trying to \nimprove things yeah yeah I've had some \ninteresting time definitely interesting \ntime to be an AI and deep learning \nyeah for sure yeah I I feel the \nexcitement of like I think the \nBreakthrough fatigue is very interesting \nbecause I also like was like with the \nstable diffusion thing I don't know what \nit was about me but I kind of just like \nwas like all right yeah it's cool but \nbut this new Chat gbt thing to me this \nbreakthrough is like I love it it's so \nfun like it's so much fun to play with \nit \nyeah it's definitely nothing like we saw \nbefore \num it's uh it's absolutely amazing in \nmany ways \nyeah awesome well Leo thank you so much \nfor joining the wevia podcast I think \nthis was such a collection of \ninformation and a tour from the you know \nthe cross encoders the re-ranking the \nfusion the uh you know the non-metric \nspaces in Paris light of course and I \nI'm so excited to play around with in \nParis light I think that generating data \nfor the custom Training of people's \nparticular models even just benchmarking \non these data sets and facilitating with \nthat I think that idea is just massive \nso thank you so much oh thank thank you \noh thank
