{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the 61st episode of the Weaviate Podcast! I am beyond excited to publish this one ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching the weba podcast I'm super \nexcited to welcome Rohit Agarwal from \nPort key portkey is a super exciting \ncompany making it easier to use llm \nserve them in production and routing to \ndifferent LMS saving costs all sorts of \ninteresting details that we're about to \ndive into firstly Rohit thank you so \nmuch for joining the podcast \nexcited to be here Connor looking \nforward to the discussion \nawesome so could we kick things off with \nkind of the founding vision of Port key \nsort of the problem that you you know \nset after to tackle \nabsolutely so I think when building llm \napplications will last three years or so \nat multiple companies and as we built \nout those applications we realized that \nbuilding out the first version is super \neasy you can do it as part of a \nhackathon and you get really excited \nbecause it's been 48 hours you've built \nsomething that's worthwhile it's \nvaluable and llms and Vector DBS are \nlike really powerful tools that you are \ndisposing so you build it out and yeah \nyou're now excited to show it to the \nworld uh and the minute you start doing \nthat or getting to production you \nrealize that a lot of the engineering \nchallenges that were solved in the \ntraditional engineering world are \nprobably not solved in the lln \nengineering world so think about uh \nyou're so used to using data DOC for \nlogging but how do you put these large \nchunks of strings in data dog it doesn't \nwork similarly Vector databases behave a \nlittle different than regular databases \nso how you're monitoring them how do you \nmake sure that your app stays reliable \nsecure compliant a lot of these things I \nthink the gold layers of devops have not \nbeen built for the llm world \nyou know an example I often like to take \nis for every other API you get a success \nor an error so it's very deterministic \nbut for an llm or even a vector database \nit's like it's all probability \neverything is between zero and one so \nevery system sort of has to adapt to \nthis new reality of probabilities and \nnot deterministic outputs so that was \nsort of the background where we felt \nokay there needs to be an llm Ops \ncompany uh we had written down sort of a \nManifesto back in December January on \nwhat this could look like but then we \nstarted building this out uh in early \nMarch \nis so many exciting points I like the \nyou know data dog the monitoring thing \nis core topic to weave yet I want to \nstay like hello llm Ops versus ml Ops \nmaybe uh separate the two a little more \nabsolutely I think and it's very \ninteresting I think they're they're very \njoint to some extent I've had \nconversations with people where they say \nthat llmops is probably a subset of \nenvelopes \num I would disagree a little bit I think \nthe difference core difference is that \nmlops focused a lot more on servers \nwhile llmops is more on Services uh for \nML Ops you had core metrics like drift \naccuracy \nEtc whereas these terms are probably \nalmost unheard of in the llm world \nunless you're building your own core \nfoundational model where you'll worry \nabout drift Etc 99 of the use cases \nyou're using a deployed llm model that's \npre-trained and steady to use so then \nyou're more worried about using the apis \nwhat's the latency of these apis how \naccurate are these which is where you \nknow stuff like evaluations output \nvalidations \nretry metrics or if these things come \ninto play versus the amylopes metrics so \nI think \nit's a little bit different analog in in \nsome places it can be extremely \ndifferent which is where I think \neven think of the concept of test data \nand train data right for an llm \na majority of the companies are not \ndoing any testing or training at all if \nyou just pick an API and just start at \nit so I think that's that therein lies \nthe big difference between ml Ops and \nllmops \nyeah I think before we step further into \nmaybe almost the more like academic \ntopics around the whole you know LMS and \nmachine learning I'm I'm just kind of \nreally curious about like the state of \nthe market kind of like you know \nyesterday I was you know Eric was \nlooking into llama 2 from weviate and \nwe've we've saw how you can serve it \nwith replicate and there's like brev and \nyou know I've known about like modal \nbanana like kind of like serverless \nwhere you wrap kind of info and just \nlike hug just like so many options to \nrun models like well it's kind of the \nstate of that like model inference API \nMarket \nyeah I think it's amazing right till \ntill you're back or till two years back \nyou had to deploy everything on your own \nso people would rush towards you know a \nstage maker kind of a setup where you're \ndeploying your own models you're testing \nit out and there's so much stuff to be \ndone and everybody was busy for six to \neight months something would come out \nyou'd I trade and go forward from there \nbut then I think with these uh inference \nAPI endpoints that came out it the game \ncompletely changed now most the \ncompanies are very happy with I'm just \ngoing to deploy or let somebody else \nmanage my deployment \nhow they speed up their gpus how they \neffectively utilize the entire core of \nthe machine is not my expertise I'm not \ngoing to spend time doing it but what \nyou can do is use these apis for you \nknow solving my business problems and I \nthink that's where we also see I mean \nMosaic posted this very interesting stat \nright or there was a database I think \ndatabricks posted this stat that said \nllms are probably their fastest growing \nand fastest adoption segment across \nanything that they've seen before and \nthat's probably because \nearlier you were constrained by you know \na lot of data science machine learning \ntraining testing that needed to happen \nbefore business Logics could be \nintroduced and now you're seeing \nbusiness logic introduced on day one and \nthen maybe some testing training \nhappening a little Point down the line \nwhen you're really looking at accuracy \nor latency or cost \nso I think \nwe digest a little bit from your \nquestion but uh \nit certainly is that inference API \nendpoints have made it super easy for a \nlot more companies to utilize \nTransformers as the technology \nand then because of that nobody wants to \ndeploy these foundational models anymore \nbut you do want that you know next level \nof fine-tuning or data privacy or \ncompliance metrics and in those cases uh \nthere's a there's a variety of companies \nout there that just offer these services \nat a very very affordable price I mean \nwe work with players like banana model \nbefore and it's just so easy to work \nwith them and they'll say hey we already \nhave these models pre-deployed you can \nfine tune with us go live and it just \nbecomes so easy deploying a model so \nit's almost like the llm world to a \nlarge extent is getting commoditized \nreally really fast wherein I don't need \nto manage all of these gpus myself so in \nfact you know I see almost three layers \nof companies evolving one is companies \nthat are providing bare metal gpus so \nyou deploy a model you train it and \nthat's for that's not for the \nfaint-hearted that's where you've got \nthe ml expertise you've got your data \nscientists in place and you're like okay \nfine I'm gonna do this on my own that's \ngreat then you have these next level of \ninfo companies which are like we're \ngoing to deploy all of the open source \nmodels or you tell us what you want us \nto do or fine tune and we'll do it at \nourselves so it's it's more a managed \nmodel service you know dlfx does this \nobviously to some extent with MPT and \nothers but and then there's this third \ncategory which is the open AI anthropic \ncohere which is like Hey we're doing end \nto end you just need to worry about your \nAPI key and everything else is managed \nso I think almost three layers depending \non how deep do you want to go or how \nmature you are as an AI company uh \ncompanies tend to choose different \nlayers \nyeah I definitely want to like later in \nthe podcast take your temperature on the \num like you know run a closed model the \nend to end versus fine-tuned language \nmodels and just like kind of wear your \nsentiments out on that one but I kind of \nwant to stay on like kind of Port key \nthe product first of all that was a \nreally great tour I love the three \nlevels of you know bare metal up to like \nthis kind of like um running open source \nmodels or running uh models where you \nfine-tuned it but hey you don't need to \nworry about now deploying it I'm gonna \ntake care of that I I really think \nthat's a super interesting emergence of \nthis Market but okay so something I \nreally took away from portkey that I \nfind is fascinating is um you say I have \num you know I use gbt4 I use anthropics \ncommand nightly and I use cloud and I'm \ngetting rate limited by open AI so I so \nnow I can pivot how do you think about \nlike managing multiple llms in uh in \nyour apps \nabsolutely so almost think of this as \nthis \nso I end up drawing a lot of parallels \nfrom the traditional devops world so the \ntraditional devops world has the concept \nof API gateways and load balancers now \nwe've sort of implemented the same \nthings here so you know think of an AI \nGateway or an llm Gateway and that is \nconnected and load balancing across \nmaybe multiple keys or multiple accounts \nof open AI or even between open Ai and \nanthropic so this could be load \nbalancing this could be fallbacks this \ncould be retries this could even be \nCanary testing and portkey makes all of \nthis possible wherein we are in the end \nconnected by all of these different \nproviders closed doors open source \nbanana everybody else \nand the user just needs to call one \nendpoint and Define a configuration \nsaying how do I want this call to \nTraverse and quad key can essentially \norchestrate the entire call and make \nsure that you get \nyou know the fastest call with the best \naccuracy \nwhich is also cost efficient so that's \nsomething that we do on our side but \nyou get to choose whichever model you \nwant at any point in time and portkey \ncan manage the rest \nso quickly let me ask about \num so so the kind of model inferences \nthat we're routing are are you mostly \nseeing you know open AI cohere or maybe \nlike you know Azure Bedrock kind of like \nsome of the more like major Google uh \nlike the major uh Cloud products like \nwhat what kind of um ensembles of apis \ndo you tend to see organized this way \nyeah I think so it's been surprising to \nme the most common actually the most \ncommon isn't surprising it's open Ai and \nAzure because people are trying to go \nover the rate limits and Azure gives \nthem the extra rate limits uh sometimes \nit's faster than open AI inference \npoints so multiple accounts of open AI \nor open Ai and Azure are the most \ncommonly load balanced system that we \nsee on 4K today \na lot of companies are not trying out \nanthropic uh as a fallback because \nthey're saying you don't want to get \nwhen they're locked into only open AI we \ndon't know how their model evolves so \nthere are companies that are falling \nback to anthropic and also building \nthose capabilities and I think just \nbecause portkey makes it super easy to \ndo this you don't have to set up \nanything at your end and we're just \ndoing uh you know we're falling back to \nmultiple providers as well the other \nthing that's interesting and it's just \nbegun to happen and we discussed this \nabout players like banana Etc is as \ncompanies become a little more mature \nand they're serving a lot more calls and \nthey have the data to fine-tune a \nfoundational model for a very limited \nuse case then they're saying hey let's \ntry a load balance between open Ai and \nmy fine tune model and evaluate the \nresults \nwhich is we'll do an 80 20. again if I \ndraw from the traditional engineering \nboard you have these blue green \ndeployments I want to use the fine-tune \nmodel but I have no idea if it works \nwell enough so let's do an 80 20 test \num I'm going to send 80 of my calls to \nopen AI 20 to my fine tune model \nused evaluations and human feedback and \nthen compare the performance and if it \nstarts to do well then just start \nincreasing the load until I get to 100 \nthere yeah so that's that's something \nthat you're seeing and that's actually a \nvery interesting space for companies as \nthey mature \nyeah that or yeah I think that's you \npainted the picture perfectly how you \nthink about deploying a new model and \nhow you're going to integrate it with \nyour software definitely you know yeah \nit's all very clear I guess like um yeah \nmaybe we could just kind of step into \nthis broad like you know fine-tuning \nllms you know I I maybe just to tell a \nquick story I've been looking heavily \ninto the gorilla models so this is where \nyou like fine tune a language model to \nuse a particular set of apis and so in \nour case we're fine-tuning language \nmodels to use the weeviate API so what \nthis could result in is like an auto API \nwhere you would come to wevia and you \nsay hey I want to make a bm25 search but \nyou don't know the graphql syntax yet so \nthis language model would produce the \ngraphql for you and and so so this has \nbeen my experience with you know \nfine-tuning language models and so yeah \nso this kind of like you know it's \ngetting so easy there's like a replica \ntutorial on llama too this is like how \nto find a tuna llm obviously Mosaic ml \nbeing Acquired and so it's like yeah \nthis kind of General thinking on \nfine-tuning llms can you just maybe if \nwe could even step out of just like what \nyou're seeing in the market just like \nyour sentiment on oh well yeah it's like \nthe city has sentiment on the evolution \nof how common that's becoming to do \nyeah I think again it's almost the \nmaturity curve of organizations adopting \nllms so as you you'll always tend to \nstart with something that's very safe \nyou know this is you know very well \ndefined and then you sort of say okay \nnow I want to extract the next level of \nefficiency so I think there are probably \ntwo three factors that play one is \nobviously maturity so as you go more \nmature you want to fine tune you want \nbetter results you want to outsmart the \ncompetition you want to build your modes \nso that's where fine tuning really \nbecomes useful the second is I think \nI've seen companies which are really \nparticular about data and privacy they \nwant to only work with their own hosted \nfoundational models so it's interesting \nthat Azure today offers \nyou know co-located servers I don't know \nwhat exactly they call it but they say \nwe can deploy or we'll VPC pure the \nopening apis to your API and that's how \nwe work so \nI think that's where companies are \nbecoming more and more interested in \nfine tuning foundational models uh \nbecause I mean llamato is really good in \nterms of \nuh actual business use cases and how you \ncan get started with it especially for \nsmaller use cases like gorilla is a \nbeautiful example I'd love a world right \nwhere you don't need to probably invoke \nor remember the API endpoint make \nmistakes in the body of the post request \nand then fail rather than just sending a \ntext query saying that hey this is what \nI want and if something fails it just \nreplies back in text and I can again \nreply so I think that can be a really \nnatural conversation the same way maybe \nConor and rohith are talking on a \npodcast can servers talk to each other \nusing natural language and that becomes \nlike the new API standard so that'll be \nfantastic and these use cases which are \nvery limited can be done much much \nfaster and using a fine tune llm so \nI think that's where people are now \ntrying to figure out what are these \nsmall use cases pick them out and create \nuh fine-tune llms on top of it I think \nit would be \nit would be unjust not to mention but \nalmost everybody is right now looking \nforward to open air releasing fine \ntuning capabilities for 3.5 in gpd4 \nthat could be a major step forward for a \nlot of people because these models are \nalready really good and if I am able to \nfine tune them on my own data and get \nthem you know get \nall of its latent capabilities to my \ndata that would just be fantastic so I \nthink fine tuning is going to become \nI mean I am definitely looking forward \nto more and more use cases on fine \ntuning both on foundational models as \nwell as on the the players that already \nare ruling the market \nyeah I have a couple interesting things \nwith fine tuning that I've been thinking \nabout the first well the the first one I \nI don't even know if it's worth \ncontinuing on the conversation but it's \nthis idea like earlier I think maybe uh \nseven months ago I had Jonathan Franco \non the podcast from Mosaic ML and he was \nexplaining this idea of like continued \nlanguage modeling on your data so you \nknow say I want to do again this gorilla \nmodel that writes we V8 apis If instead \nof just going right to uh instruction \ntuning with the did you write the API \ncorrectly I also continued language \nmodeling like a gigantic data set of \nlike we VA documentations like so like \nthat kind of intermediate step and so I \ndo think a lot about is that needed and \nso that's like one topic but the second \ntopic that I think is a little more \ninteresting especially for weaviate and \nparticularly retrieval augmented \ngeneration \nthis is another nugget I took out of the \ngorilla paper is that they're um they're \ngoing to be doing retrieval aware fine \ntuning so what this would look like as \nyou know most of these like uh how to \nfine-tune an llm with replicate is like \njust kind of give us the data right so \nyou would you would retrieve and then \nyou would put that in the data and then \nit's still uh instruction to so you \nwould put yeah put the retrieval with \nthe input and \nit's I think this kind of retrieval \naware tuning it because you know \nespecially for us maybe if I could ask \nyou this broad question of how you see \nretrieval augmented generation because \nthat's especially with weaving and \nVector databases that's like the you \nknow the hot Gold Line \ntotally yeah I think no ID \nuh is definitely the flavor Everybody is \nusing it's also \nit's amazing when it works right so I \nremember there was this blog post by \nGuan back in like late 2020 where he was \ntalking about context stuffing to make \nyour LM outputs a lot better and context \nstuffing earlier was examples or context \nor everything that you can give the llm \nbecause then you're constraining \num the output that it produces and that \nwas something a lot of companies and you \nknow early content generation companies \nused quite a bit and then once the RDG \npaper came out uh I mean not the paper \nbut the RG implementations came out it \nwas just amazing how people are getting \nto use this for a variety of use cases \nright and \num then so you have base RNG then you \nhave these interesting Chain of Thought \nexperiments on top of rig which is I've \nasked you a question let's do a Chain of \nThought analysis let's reason let's \nclassify and get to the right answer \naccurately so I think that entire chain \nthat started to evolve \num is obviously very very interesting \num Rog itself has multiple flavors \num somebody yesterday but we're talking \nabout how internal company use cases \nversus external companies cases the rack \ncan be very very different for internal \nuse cases you need a lot more \npermissioning access management Control \nManagement Etc versus for external use \ncases so if you're doing uh you know \nlike a customer service spot then maybe \nit's lesser restrictions or \npermissioning but a larger set to search \non so how do you do that using say \nhybrid search in review so those are \nvery interesting Concepts that people \nare now \num looking for \nuh interestingly data leakage was \nanother thing we've been discussing with \nthe customer very actively so they're \nworried about your leakage because now \nyou have all of this so earlier the data \nis very very segmented in their database \nbut as we know these embeddings to a \nvector database how do the embedding \nstay as segregated as their data here \nand what are the you know compliance \nrequirements for that so those are all \nthe things that people are now getting \ninto as they understand Rag and then \nthey're taking these rag implementations \nto Legal security to their instances Etc \nyeah \nyeah I can I oh I'm not sure I see it \nwith embeddings all the way yet but I \ncan I remember with the language models \nhow you'd be like um you prompt it with \nlike uh the email these like from Bob \nVan light to and then it's start yeah \nthat could be a problem with language \nmodels yeah yeah and I mean yeah that \nmulti-tenancy kind of thing you know \nrv8120 introduce a major revamp for that \nand people listening you know Eddie and \nDelacruz CTO he explains that and yeah \nthat's something that um you know that's \nsomething I wouldn't have known about \njust academically looking at the papers \nyou know that's something I think you \ngot to go out there and see a little bit \nto understand what a problem it is but \nyeah it's all really interesting I guess \num so I get then kind of on this topic \nof fine-tuning and yeah there's def \nthere's you know compliance and it's \nhuge issues from you know just \nsensitivity within business I think also \nlike you know it's kind of related to \nlike can gbt really be your doctor or \nlike that kind of thing and um but kind \nof pivoting a little bit I want to come \nback to \num this kind of like Port key and this \nkind of um you know just like the cost \nSavings of running inference and so I \nmaybe we've talked about a load balancer \nthat kind of like um you know is uh \nsaying mostly from the perspective of \nlike this is rate limited do you also \nlike you know yeah I think people are \naware that if you start paying it too \nfast it says hey stop it and so you you \nknow you go but you also think of it of \nmaybe like first ask the question to the \ncheaper language model see the answer \nthat comes back and then say okay and \nsend that to the user versus like no \nlet's give that to the more expensive \none \nyep absolutely I think we're starting to \nsee those implementations now when \npeople are \nuh and that is you know so llm call to \nthe cheaper model evaluation and then \ndecide if you want to send it forward or \nnot uh a simpler implementation of this \nis also make the cheaper API call uh \nbecause I know that it works 80 of the \ntimes the user has the capability to \nregenerate especially for very low \nhanging use cases so where it doesn't \nreally matter and the users totally fine \nregenerating the second call goes to the \nGPT 4 API so it's like a mixture of \nthese two but definitely the LM call \nevaluation second LM call is usually a \nvery interesting plate if you're \nstarting to see some companies do very \nmuch and this is almost a 10x price \ndifference so it becomes so much easier \nand you know even in terms of \nJanuary testing a lot of people will \nmake calls to both apis initially figure \nout the similarity between these apis so \nthat you have at least a minimal level \nof confidence that this model performs \nat least 80 percent of the times and \nthen I can start to expose that a little \nbit more \nyeah because I think well I think \nthere's already going to be so much \nvalue I imagine you know with just \nrouting it with rate limiting and then \nrouting it for accuracy but then kind of \nyou know dreaming into the academic \nthing and like one thing is there's this \nidea it's kind of related to gorilla \nwhere you have like gbt4 is kind of like \nthe Master model and it would route to \nlike in the gorilla sense it would route \nto a tool and then you have a smaller \nllm that uses that formats the request \nto the tool particularly like alleviate \nthe graphql API or there's this other \nidea where it's like um you turn like \nthe hugging face model Hub into like um \nyou could think of each model as an app \nI don't know if I love this but like you \nknow you're the image segmentation model \nso I go get my segmentation mask then I \nsend that to the classifier stuff like \nthis so do you think about that kind of \nlike orchestration of models as being \nmaybe like an a direction Port key would \ngo in \nyeah I think \num not right now uh we're mostly focused \non production use cases where we've seen \ncompanies already go to production with \nit I think this is clearly in the realm \nof so you first have agents and tools \nwhich are yet to go to production in a \nreally large way \num from our perspective uh and then you \nyou're thinking about models as Tools in \nagents I think that is clearly an area \nof Interest right now a lot of academic \nPursuits happening in there but I have \nnot really seen anybody deploy this in \nfact we've seen the reverse wherein you \nhave a very uh simplistic prompt router \nwhich which is written before the llm \nwhich decides which llm should I send \nthis call to or should does this need \nadditional context so I need to send it \nuh to my Vector database to get the \ncontext from there and then push in the \nllm so I think that smaller model is \nactually more efficient also because \nmore business most business use cases I \nwould not like the added latency of you \nknow the entire chain running and then I \ngetting an answer so you'd want to drop \noff at the right point so you definitely \ndon't want to introduce additional \nlatencies in play and I know we'll talk \nabout caching a little bit later but I \nthink semantic cash is one of those \npieces right which is how can I return \nan answer faster so I think latency is \nsomething that businesses really really \ncare about so for anything that's \nasynchronous and you don't care you're \ngonna get a reply later then yes we can \ndo this you know interesting routing \nacross multiple llm calls and then get \nour output but for most other cases you \nwant it as fast as possible so yeah \nyeah uh yeah I love kind of like I've \nbeen studying a lot of llama index and \nthese query routings kind of like where \nyou have one language model that takes \nthe query and says you know is this my \nfavorite example is like is this a \nvector search query or is this a SQL \nsymbolic query \nso that kind of routing you don't need \nlike uh 300 billion parameter model to \nto do that yeah I think that's really \nit'll be really fascinating how this how \nthe um llm Frameworks evolve with the \nhosting of different models needed for \ndifferent kind of routing or tool \nselection it'd definitely be a whole a \nhuge thing but but yeah you mentioned it \nand let's get into it our debate topic \nwhen we met in Berkeley was um you know \nsemantic caching I I admit when you know \nwhen we first started talking about it I \nwas kind of cold on the topic I didn't \nreally like because I kind of think that \nlike the the Nuance of prompting is it's \nso particular but you know you explain \nto me about question answering and and \nyeah and so I do agree that this kind of \nsemantic caching of LM calls could be \nreally interesting could you maybe uh \nset the stage on the topic \nabsolutely so I think caching has been a \nthing that's been long uh drawn we've \nseen caching use cases across llms very \nwell but when we implemented caching so \nthis is almost something that we learned \nacross the way right so when we \nimplemented caching for our users we saw \na cache trade of approximately two \npercent and I mean it's no surprise is \nthere because everybody's probably \nasking the same questions but they're \nall asking it in a very different way \nand the whole \npromise of llms is that there's no \nannoying what clicks anymore so there's \nno deterministic inputs which means \ncaching becomes that much harder because \nit's not the same query anymore right \nbut if you still look at it for customer \nsupport use cases employee support use \ncases ID support knowledge search \n60 to 70 percent of all of an employee \nquery or a customer queries are going to \nbe similar they're going to be somebody \nwould have asked them in the last seven \ndays even if I take a very short window \nso how do you go about really making \nsure that I can serve responses faster \nif I've already seen that question so \nfor example somebody asks does vv8 have \na free developer plan or somebody else \nI'm a developer \nnow these are both the same questions \nand the answer is whatever it is but \nthen how do I go and make sure how I \ncould either do it through a complicated \nllm call or \nif I can \nscrape the intent of the question from \nThe Prompt coming in \nstore it as an embedding in a vector \ndatabase \nand then match every incoming query to \nmy list of already answered queries then \nI can essentially build a very effective \nsemantic cache so I think that's where \nwe started saying okay this seems like a \nstraightforward enough problem let's \nbuild semantic caching and let's go to \nlet's try it out so I think the results \nwere \nI think they were just amazing wherein \nwe saw without any optimizations 20 of \nall of our queries would give us a 90 95 \n96 accuracy so and 20 of these queries \nwould be 20x faster \num I think the challenges and this is \nwhat uh I think milvis launched with GPD \ncash uh and which also I think which is \nalso why you were skeptical and I \nremember discussing it then then I think \nthe base semantic cash the base semantic \ncash implementation is probably just a \ntheoretical uh foray but it doesn't \nsolve use cases because in the five \npercent that it fails it's gonna give \nyou a an extremely absurd answer and \nit's going to give it extremely fast so \nyou will feel like you know it's coming \nfrom cash it's absolutely wrong and \nyou've probably leaked some data because \nyour question and answer are completely \ndifferent that was a question asked by \nsomebody else the context was very \ndifferent and now I have leaked data so \nand this is where I think we started our \njourney of just understanding semantic \ncash how it works I think that's where \nwe ended up implementing uh you know \ndismatch patch libraries \num we take out relevant parts of the \nprompt which need to be cached because a \nmajority of the prompt is similar so I \ndon't need to Cache it so how do we take \nthat out \num there's a lot of post-processing \ninvolved then to make sure there's a \nquick eval check to see you know is the \nquestion and the answer relevant to each \nother \nand then there's a constant evaluation \nmodel running to say that before I \nintroduce semantic caching let's what is \nthe right Vector confidence to set so \nthat I get a 99 or 99.5 \nso it's this entire production chain \nthat builds you a very robust semantic \ncache \num and that's where I think we've spent \na lot of time just tuning these small \nlittle things to make sure the entire \npiece really works but now yes we are \nseeing customers when they start they \nstart on day one with 15 to 20 percent \nof their responses being served from \ncash \nand in some cases we've seen it go as \nhigh as 60 percent of their responses \nwhich is like phenomenal for them most \nfrom a cost savings perspective as well \nas in terms of user experience I think \nyou still have to get we're constantly \nworking to keep getting accuracy better \nand better uh but I really think we've \ngotten it to a stage where it's super \nuseful for Enterprise search use cases \ncustomer support reg \nyeah it just makes sense there \nyeah as first I think there were a ton \nof nuggets on the great details and I \nreally enjoyed it I like the as you \nended with the kind of well yeah this \nthinking of like the how do you check \nthe failures case can you maybe \ncalibrate the vector distance of the \nsimilarity from the query to the \nquestions you have cached I find that to \nbe very interesting at wevia we've \nlooked into Auto cut where we we look at \nwe plot like you know Vector distances \non the on the y-axis and then X is like \nresult and then you try to check a a \nslope to say only give you like three \nout of the 100 search results to try to \nlike but but yeah just for the top one I \ndon't see a good solution to that I mean \ncalibrating your vector distance scores \nfor your particular you know that I \nthink like I'm going off topic but like \nthere is like conformal prediction like \nthat that seems to be like when you know \nlike causal inference like how they're \nlike these buzz like these emerging \ncategories of research I see that that \ncoming up a lot so it does seem like you \nknow uh the research and uncertainty is \ncatching up but um yeah maybe even just \ntake a step back like I remember like \nwith weavier when we were brainstorming \nhow to add a site search to eviate \nI thought one thing that would be really \ninteresting is just to kind of you know \ncreate a frequently asked questions and \nthen just the embedding of the query to \none of the frequently asked questions \nwould be a way to do it but then you \nkind of mentioned like this cold start \nof like 15 to 20 evolving to 60 because \nit's like you might not have a \ncomprehensive FAQ yet so you can start \nusing your you know language model QA \nsystem until you build up this base and \nnow this cache thing is really critical \nand yet it's really fascinating I mean I \ncan imagine also like um you know you \nmentioned like data leakage like if I if \nI'm coming to and I tell you about my \nparticular schema as I'm asking you this \nquestion about my bug and then you end \nup like giving away some questions I can \nimagine maybe a language model that \ntakes that and then says and then says \nlike please rewrite this to up to you \nknow make it more abstract and then that \nresult is what's saved in the cache yeah \nI think it's a supercharger for question \nanswering systems and I think that like \nyou know chat with yeah like the whole \nquestion answering part of that is just \none of the biggest applications but I \nguess kind of my question then is um \nthis kind of like embeddings for \nquestion answering there's also like \nembeddings for classification \nis like how do you see like when a task \nis ripe for just embeddings and just \nVector search alone is the way to do it \ncompared to when you're like no you need \na generative model for this kind of task \nyeah I think for anything to do with \nclassifications \num classification topic modeling \nanything that has a deterministic answer \nit's a deterministic question you need a \ndeterministic answer or at least you \nneed options which are deterministic I \nthink in those cases yes an embedding is \nprobably the best solution unless so \nmaybe let's let's do this right so you \nhave deterministic input deterministic \noutput embeddings \num \nsubjective input deterministic output \nmay be functions so use Json form or \nfunctions or embedding so it can be both \nso you can have an llm call which \nreturns Json or you can have an \nembedding you'll have to see which one \nworks better \nsubjective input subjective output then \nyou need an llm call with a cache on top \nif you see a lot of these similar \nquestions coming in which is where I \nfeel \nrag use cases q a use cases search use \ncases these three are all subjective \ninput subjective output which is where \nyou need an llm call with the vector DB \nin place \nthat's what I think but what what has \nbeen your learning from seeing all of \nthese systems at bv8 so far \nwell I think um one uh you know email \nand Finn set up uh Kappa AI with \nleviated it's really cool I think they \njust got into Y combinator and it you \nknow they're you know going to the moon \nand it's really cool and it makes me \nthink about how um a lot of people \ncriticized uh apps that that were \ndescribed as like a rapper around a gbt \nAPI but if you're a Kappa and you're \ncollecting uh you know customer question \nanswer for you know like we via slag is \nin the Llama index Discord and like so \nlike you build up this data and now your \nremote is that uh data set that you \ncould then cache for cost savings and \nthat's kind of the light bulb that's \ngoing off in my head is I'm thinking \nlike you don't need to create a moat \nnecessarily by fine tuning with \ngradients with I think that's like a lot \nof what AI people would think is that he \nlike you you know train train it really \nnicely and yeah but like having a having \na really curated data set for retrieval \naugmented generation it's yeah yeah I \ndefinitely let me pass it back to you on \nthat kind of like the debate between you \nget better performance by fine-tuning \nthe language model or just by really \nhaving great data for your retrieval \naugmented generation stack \nyeah I think I would love to do like a \nlike a proper Benchmark on this I \nhonestly haven't seen one \nI think my general guess would be if \nit's a very repeatable use case \num \nuh then maybe fine tunes might work out \nbetter \nso you know it's the same character \nlength output it's gonna contain almost \nthe same information \nthe parameters might be different then I \nfeel so fine tuning is great for \nconstraining outputs right so you can \nkeep improving accuracy up till the \npoint and you can keep constraining your \noutputs as much as possible whereas and \nI think that's where fine tuning is \nreally shines so if you're doing product \ndescriptions just keep constraining keep \nfine tuning keep getting a great data \nset and then your product descriptions \nare gonna look great \nbut the minute you're going for variance \nI think that's when you do need \nembeddings and Vector search \num at least that's been my practical \nlearning so far that fine tuning \nand these can still coexist in fact I \nwould love to see an amazing lag use \ncase where you fine-tuned a model and \nthen you're passing in the right context \nand this always knows that I've got to \nbe helpful this is my tone this is how I \nreply I've seen these questions I've \nseen these things before Etc so I think \nbut definitely giving it the context in \nthe prompt is more valuable than relying \non its memory or the llm's memory \nbecause there's just so much stuff \ninside it that's very hard for it to \nprioritize which one to pick at what \ntime \nyeah \nI \num yeah there's definitely I think um \nwith me with my sentiment on fine tuning \nI think like so that gorilla experiment \nI mentioned earlier is retrieval aware \nfine tune where you retrieve the API \ndocumentation and then you know you get \nlike the schema the API for like how to \ndo bm25 search and we get and then it \nwould write bm25 query and so I guess \nfor me so you mentioned fine tuning is \nlike how you steer it into that narrow \npocket of the space so it's like this is \nthe thing that you do and yeah like if \nif I fine-tuned it on so on like you \nknow I have 60 apis and we via search \napis and it I've trained on 40 and then \nit can't generalize to the 20 or or what \nhappens is I train it on the 60 and then \n20 new ones come out and it can't \ngeneralize to the new ones as well as \nthe you know gbt4 can that would firstly \nbe kind of that would hurt my sentiment \non fine tuning pretty pretty massively \nbut I guess the other thing is like um \nI've been experimenting where I \nsummarized these podcasts with like one \nof those summarization chains where it's \nlike you will receive the clips one by \none as well as the summary so far and \nthen you know you use the localizer and \nso because it doesn't really deeply \nunderstand \nyou know like um just what we're talking \nabout right now right it'll it'll it'll \nusually just kind of collapse uh topics \ninto like comma lists so like with that \nuse case I think heavily that if I \nfine-tune the language model doing that \nlanguage modeling thing we talked about \nwhere you continue language modeling it \non weeviate you know just like as much \ninformation as I can find but I actually \nso sorry I kind of want to Pivot the the \ntopics a bit back into kind of you know \nbeing at The Cutting Edge of you know \nwith Port key and you know this kind of \nlike you know this layer between the LMS \nand overall understanding that this is a \nnew layer in the software cycle gets us \ncloser to cheaper llm inference I want \nto kind of talk about two things that \ncheaper llm inference would unlock and \nsorry if this is a context switch but \nthe first is this tree of thoughts thing \nwhere you could \num go several Pathways you know it's \naside from kind of the caching I suppose \nmaybe you could cash paths but like this \nas as inference gets cheaper we'll be \nable to do this kind of thing and what \ndo you think could be the potential of \nthat \nyeah absolutely I think so a lot of the \nthings that \num you needed deep decision trees to \ndecide can now be left on reasoning by \nthe llms \num I think it's going to be a function \nof cost as well as latency so you need \nto be able to process this fast enough \nbecause if your router is going to take \nthree seconds then your infant's gonna \ntake another three you've necessarily \ndoubled your latency which which nobody \nwants so I think cost is definitely \nwithout it getting cheaper you \ndefinitely cannot route but then if I \ncould do you know two queries on add a \nlevel cost and inference time that would \njust be up that would be mind blowing \nbecause then I would imagine a lot of \nsoftware developers will just stop \nwriting workflow code at all I mean why \ndo you need to create workflows and \nsoftware which are essentially just \ndecision trees and these decisions can \nbe taken extremely fast extremely cheap \nextremely accurately by an llm itself \nyou know so a very interesting example \nfor this is \nuse and throw software I think that I \nfeel is going to get on the rise because \nof this wherein could I just spin up a \nquick replied instance and half charge \nGPD write me some code that says hey I \njust want to create 50 PDFs with this \ntext in it these are appraisal letters \nfor all of my employees create these \nPDFs upload them to my Google Drive Link \nthat's attached here ask me any \nquestions and then if the llm could \nnavigate the entire piece and give me \nthe output which basically \nit's doing routing plus inference plus a \nlittle bit more then I think it's it's \nbecomes really really interesting \nbecause you don't need workflows anymore \nyou can just rely on the lln building \nthe workflow and I think this is \nslightly different from Agents because \nagents are doing multiple inferences \nGathering data points from those \ninferences and then using it out versus \njust saying that create the entire \ndecision tree framing which is the \nworkflow and the llm is then in control \nbut I'd love to see a time that it comes \npossible I don't think we're anywhere \nthere yet because you need extremely \nhighly extremely fast inference and \nextremely cheap inference to even make \nthat happen \nyeah I agree completely with that \nperspective I and earlier we made \npodcast Colin Harman had described that \nyou know like Auto gbt it's yeah it's \nlike the search of a workflow and it \nalso kind of reminds me of demonstrate \nsearch predict from a marketab and the \nlab at Stanford where they give like a \nfew input output examples and you're \nkind of like compiling the the workflow \nthat would produce those input outputs \nand so yeah I I think all that kind of \nthinking and \nyeah it's fast I mean as the the cost of \ninference gets cheaper so this kind of \nbrings so then the next thing I wanted \nto kind of talk about with as the \ninference gets cheaper is uh we've had \nthis we've been trying to like \nevangelize this generative feedback \nloops or the ideas that you know you do \nsome kind of generation and then you \nsave it back into your vector database \nand so you know a simple example could \nbe I get my new blog post and then I \ntake my crms and I write a personalized \nhey why you should care about this blog \npost to everyone in my CRM and you know \nI and then you know I that kind of \nthinking that I save that back in a \ndatabase so maybe first you let me take \nyour gauge your interest in that idea \nbroadly like that kind of thing of how \npeople use well because we've already \nkind of talked about it with some it's \nactually semantic caching is kind of \nexactly this idea because you're \nanswering the questions and saving it \nback but um \nso the the the big headline thing that \nreally excites me is like you know like \nvector search is about scaling Vector \ndistance calculations like people kind \nof troll it on Twitter by saying like \nhey I just implemented a vector database \nbecause you've like numpy Brute Force \nlike 100 000 vectors but I think really \nthe exciting thing is once you're \ntalking about searching through like 10 \nmillion 100 million billion so on how \nbig of a number can I say right now but \nlike but um this kind of I feel like \nthis kind of generative feedback loop \ncan be the Evangelist for like where \neverybody is thinking about having data \nof that scale to search through like you \nknow I I pointed to my blog post and it \nlike writes it Compares parts of the \nblog post I don't know it does useful \nthings such that it's like it creates \nthis latent space what do you kind of \nthink of that idea yeah no I think it's \ninteresting I haven't given it a lot of \nthought honestly until now but I'm \nalmost now imagining people build data \nLakes before this just to store a bunch \nof data so that I can query it and I can \nuse it for training or I could do so \nmany things with it I think this is \nalmost like the vector data lake or a \nvector link you have so much embeddings \nthrown in it that now I can do various \ndifferent computations calculations and \ntraining on it so that's actually a very \ninteresting concept exactly semantic \ncaching is exactly that right so it's \nstoring the outputs back in for a \nspecific use case but then I can \ndefinitely think of \nevaluations as another use case \num maybe some validations maybe \nfine-tuning at some point in time so \nthese could be interesting things what \nare other use cases you guys seen for \ngenerative feedback loops \nwell that um yeah well firstly I agree \nthat I think the semantic caching might \nhave to be the new Evangel the new like \nheadline thing for this but the you know \nthat that thing I mentioned initially of \num you know you go through you you have \nlike your newsletter and you then have a \nCRM or something and you're writing like \npersonalized that's a pretty interesting \nthing and then um there's another thing \nthat's particular to search which is \nlike if you have like you know say I \ntake our podcast and I start indexing \nthis this is like my favorite data set \nto kind of like dog food the technology \nwith is like um if I just take the raw \npodcast clip and then I pass that to a \nlanguage model and I say please \nsummarize the content and then I index \nthe summaries I actually I get way \nbetter search results with this with the \nindex because you know like this like \nbecause like um if it's like totally \nruin the embedding sort of not totally \nruin it but like it's not as good as the \ntransformed and so that's been probably \nmy favorite thing in the search case is \nyou transform it for a better index \nthere's there's yeah there's also like \nyou extract structured data from the \nchunks and \nthe chunking like chunking text of the \nvector databases that's quite a deep \ntopic but yeah totally \nyeah I think kind of the headline here \nthough is like the you know Technologies \nlike portkey and this whole emerging you \nknow llm inference is getting cheaper \nthere are more options we've got this \nllama 2 model like is the latest one as \nwe're recording now you know we had MPT \n30 billion come before that and like it \ncontinues to get cheaper and cheaper so \nthat's why I think this like tree of \nthoughts and maybe like generative \nfeedback loops I think those things are \ncurrently blocked by the cost \nand yeah \nyeah 100 I think it's just the cost of \ninference as well as I think the \nresistance of pre-produced multiple \nlanguage models today I think I'm we're \ndefinitely going to see over the next \nfew months people start to use maybe two \nthree ten twenty different models for \ndifferent use cases and then there's \nsome orchestration between them just to \nmake sure you're getting the best you \nknow on the cap theorem so cost accuracy \nperformance you have the best on the cap \ntheorem and then you've got this tiny \nrouter sitting in the middle making sure \nthat the calls are being distributed to \nthe right \num llms there and that I think will \noverall \nenable companies to collect more data \nstore more data \nobviously I'm guessing the way llm \ninference is getting cheaper I'm sure \nVector searches are also going to get \ncheaper and as that happens people will \ndefinitely want to store a lot more \num I think just search a lot more of \nthese data sets as well \nyeah no I definitely I think kind of \nlike Bob gave me this term like \nspeculative speculative design Theory \nwhere we're like kind of going out way \ninto the future but yeah I think just \nright now what you mentioned on managing \nlike yeah 15 to 20 model inferences \nwhether that's like gbt cloud or or how \nyou're going to introduce models that \nyou've fine-tuned I think that's \nabsolutely like a super massive emerging \nspace of this whole like AI market and \nso on so yeah awesome thank you so much \nfor joining the podcast I think this is \nan incredible coverage of these topics I \nhad so much fun uh picking your brain \nabout these things and you've definitely \nchanged my mind on semantic caching I \nthink that you know it's totally flipped \nI think it's very useful and awesome I'm \nso excited to be following along with \nportkey and see how all these things \ngrow \nabsolutely it was great chatting with \nyou I think as I was talking with you a \nlot of new ideas also popped into my \nhead so I'm going to write about them \nnow but thanks so much for inviting me \nConor was amazing doing this video \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Rohit Agarwal on Portkey - Weaviate Podcast #61!", "path": "", "link":
