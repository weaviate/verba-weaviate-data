{"text": "Join \u202aConnor Shorten and Bob van Luijt for the third Weaviate vector database Podcast. During the show, they will be discussing\u202c ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nchecking out another episode of the we \nv8 semi technologies podcast i'm here \nwith bob van light ceo and co-founder of \nsemi technologies me personally uh bob \nhas told this story that has really \ncaptured my interest in the we v8 vector \nsearch engine \nyou know listening to his story telling \nit on \ndmitry khan's vector podcast and all the \ndifferent uh youtube videos on wev8 has \nreally captured my attention and caused \nme to be really interested in vector \nsearch engines so i'm sure that this uh \nyou know another \nedition of listening to bob tell the \nstory will help you also be further \nconvinced of how exciting this \ntechnology is so as we do this podcast \num on the semi technologies youtube \nchannel we're sure most of our listeners \nare \nalready pretty familiar with the basics \nof vector search engines if you're not \nuh there's an introduction to we v8 on \nsemi technologies i've made one as well \nin henry ai labs there's all sorts of \nresources to get caught up with the \nbasics we're going to kind of go into \nthe details and flesh out these visions \nfor the future these exciting ideas like \ngraphql knowledge graphs neurosymbolic \nsearch these recent advances in \ninformation retrieval and supervised \nlearning multimodal learning like image \ntext search the demo endpoints the demos \nand how we see that playing out all \nsorts of really exciting things going \ninto the research and the future and all \nthese kinds of exciting things so that \nsaid um i think the first thing uh to \ntalk about will be uh like what is your \nvision how did you think of this graphql \nknowledge graphs because i think this is \na really unique flair of we've that i \ndon't see a lot out there a lot well \nyeah first of all uh uh thanks for \nhaving this conversation with me on the \non our own podcast i guess \nbut um \num yeah so \nso the originally the idea came from the \nfact that i was very intrigued by \neverything that had to do with the with \nthe semantic with the semantic web and \nthose kind of things and if you deal \nwith a semantic web then you're very \nquickly into the space of um ontologies \nand there was this one thing in \nwhen i went to conferences when i spoke \nto people that just fascinated me and \nthat was that if we talk about the \ndefinitions that we have in ontologies \nis that people don't agree on things \nit's just i that's something that \nfascinates me and that this is causing a \nlot of problems right so because the um \nuh if you wanna if we wanna search \nthrough specific data sets or if you \nwanna wanna find something then um \nthat that's hard to do and i once gave a \ntalk in greece and there was like this \nuh this guy and he said like yeah and he \nwas like he was upset about this as well \nbecause he says he said like i'm working \nfor the european union and i'm test by \ncreating the ontology \nfor rivers lakes and seas in \neurope but he said you know what the \nproblem is i said tell me \nand he said like so what the rest of \neurope calls a lake \nthey call a sea in germany i said like \nso we couldn't agree so i he said like i \ndelivered the ontology and then the \npeople in germany said like no no no \nthat's not a lake that's the seat and so \nthis wasn't a a constantly occurring \nproblem and if you see like public \ndiscussions like relative wikidata etc \nyou see that this is a this is a \nconstant problem so \nthen i got introduced to \neverything related to factorization in \nnlp bear in mind this is i'm not that \nold but it's like this is before like \nbirth and transformers and that kind of \nstuff \nand i i remember that the first thing \nthat i saw that it was that famous \nexample i believe that it was like uh \nking minus men plus women and then queen \nthat the result that was like the moment \ni saw that for the first time i was like \nboom it just i was like wow \nand a few years later i got this this \nvery simple idea which is a very \nvery hacky idea right um but i got this \nidea that i said like \nwhat if i just have a bunch of \ndocuments just three documents edges or \nparagraph of text or something i just \ntake the individual words \nand i just calculate a centroid of all \nthe individual vectors of this \nof these paragraphs i just wrote that in \npython so it was really slow but the \ngoal that i had back then was just to \nfigure out like can i \ncan i find that document by searching \nfor context rather than for keywords \nand when i was able to do that i was \nlike i had this thing that was like \nboom this is like an opportunity because \nnow \nwe can we can target a note in the graph \nwithout knowing what the current \nanthology is or the keywords are we just \nhave to describe it and then we can find \nit and from there on we can traverse the \nthe graph so \nthat is what the what the original idea \nwas and and there's way more to say \nabout this but we'll probably touch up \non this and \nrelated to graphql that's another thing \nbecause i am a very very strong believer \nin \na developer user experience \nand now you have like a problem if \nyou're dealing with a graph like data \nmodel and the problem is this \nso how much flexibility do you want to \ngive the end user to traverse down this \ngraph right so do you want to be \nsuper expressive then something like \nsparkle is interesting \nor do you want to be less expressive but \ngive a lot of make it easier to use and \nthen we of course have something like \nlike graphql \nand just asking developers about you \nknow their you know what was very \nintuitive for them and and and what you \nknow how they um i wanted to use the \ninterface we actually learned that a lot \nof them liked graphql \nand that's also what i see when i give \ndemos i just i don't even i i sometimes \nsay it's graphql and if people say like \ni never heard of graphql it's like don't \nworry because i'm going to type it out \nand it's going to be intuitive and \num \nplus the fact that we are not a graph \ndatabase but really a vector database we \nsaid like we we don't have to \nsupport all these specific graph things \nlike neo4j does or or draft does that's \nfor them to solve \nwe have this graph like data model \nwhere we want to target these nodes and \nwe're going to use graphql to do it \nbecause we believe that it's the easiest \nway for people to use it so that is the \nthe history of that uh interface i have \nto say um \nthat was just the the concept the actual \ndesign uh is done by my colleague laura \nand she saw there's also some videos \nfrom her online and that kind of stuff \nwhere she explains what she did there so \ncredits for the design go to her but the \nthe overall concept was like how can we \ngive the best ux to end users to get \naccess to these \nvectorized data objects yeah and i think \num one of the like visualizations of \nvector search that we like the most is \nsay image search like where we say take \nfashion mnist and we go find the nearest \nlooking bags but that's missing the \nmetadata of uh of the underlying image \ndata and so having that metadata and \nthen using the graph syntax to be able \nto traverse it is something that i think \nis a very exciting visualization and you \nknow the graphql demo the semi console \nit's a very cool way to start playing \naround with vector search engines and \nsomething that i'm also working on is \nlike a tutorial on using graphql but \ngenerally it's pretty easy to get \nstarted and wevg8 has at least 15 \nexamples on the documentation for anyone \nout there looking to get started with \ngraphql and and again wikipedia uh \nwikidata and also news articles are up \nthere already if you wanted to start \nplaying around with uh graphql so to \nbacktrack a little bit you were talking \nabout uh text embeddings and graph \nembeddings and this idea that you would \nuse the say average of a paragraph about \nand lakes in greece to get a text \nembedding and then go hit the semantic \nweb \ngraph and i was recently talking to \ncharles pierce akinius about how they uh \nhow they have this \nscientific literature suggestion where \nyou highlight some text and then it goes \ninto the knowledge graph of a citation \nnetwork so is that the vision that you \nstart off with the text embedding and \nthe text embedding takes you into your \nposition of the graph and from there \nit's about traversing a knowledge graph \nyeah so so the original idea was a \nlittle bit more abstract so the original \nidea really was like \nhow can i target this data object \nin in the graph \nwithout knowing what's in it how can i \nsolve that and that is what the \nembedding sold for me \num that can be text embeddings but that \ncan also be as you mentioned image \nembeddings and those kind of things \nwhat's also important to bear in mind is \nthat i i came from from somewhere else \nas where for example data scientists \ncome from so a data scientist might come \nfrom hey this is really cool we can can \nbuild a recommendation engine so i'm \ngoing to take mnist etc \ni really came from the from the \nengineering slash database perspective \nso like how can we have build a database \nthat is just smarter air quotes in um \nstoring data so it was a completely \ndifferent approach and that is for \nexample why i love the case of of uh \ncharles and kenya so much because \nthat is that is the that idea in action \nso they're using that exactly so you \nhave a database that makes it easier for \nthem to search for the um into the \ncontent so that's it's a little bit of a \ndifferent \nuh point of view and the embeddings are \njust and i have to be honest here we're \njust also a little bit lucky right so \nwith with everything that's happening in \nresearch because we're now often talking \nabout uh \nimage or text embeddings but um we're \nlooking at use cases for cyber security \nembeddings and healthcare embeddings you \nname it and you can store all these \nembeddings including the meta that are \nin in wi-fi \nso i really think that the coming one \ntwo years we're gonna see so many cool \nuse cases from stuff that people are \ncreating embeddings off so that that's \ngoing to be yeah that's just going to be \namazing yeah and we'll definitely get \nmore into all these different use cases \nand the multimodal and \npersonally i'm working with uh the \nwe're working with the memorial \nhealthcare system data where we have \nconvalescent plasma therapy treatments \nfor cover 19 and we're trying to do this \nkind of vector search where we're \nlooking for patients and it comes back \nto this topic that we're talking about \nwhere you have an underlying symbolic \nschema and this kind of idea of neural \nsearch and symbolic search and the way \nthat you really want to do neural search \nso a lot of the times and um charles and \nkenius outline this really well with \nthis concept serendipity and i hadn't \nheard this term before and i think this \nreally describes it if you do a text \nembedding the result that you get might \nkind of confuse you compared to a \nregular expression matching so if you \nsearch for keywords \nor like whatever search you do you're \ngoing to expect the keywords to be in \nthe result kind of like it's just kind \nof i think how we're biased to use \nsearch engines given google and just our \nexperience with this technology of \nsearch engines so i think we're still \ngenerally getting used to this neural \nsearch and symbolic search so wev8 is a \nneurosymbolic system i think one of the \nbest one of the you know most applicable \nneurosymbolic systems that have come to \nexist so is this something that uh this \nneurosymbolic kind of categorization do \nyou think this is something that \nmotivates and trading off some symbolic \nqueries as well as this neural search \nand how do you think about those two \nkinds of searches yeah so so um uh first \nof all i i love that example because i'm \ndealing with that as well so so just for \nsome context so what am i doing like \nmostly on a daily basis i'm \nhelping users and talking to users like \nhow do you use it and one of the things \nthe patterns that i see is that of \ncourse people have like a status quo \nsearch engine that they use and then \nthey move to something new \nand indeed keyword search is very binary \nin its results right it's true or it's \nfalse so if you search for apple and \nit's it shows you an article about uh \ntoothpaste then you go like ah that's \njust wrong it's a you can like in a \nbinary face like this there's something \nwrong with this thing because i search \nfor apple and i get toothpaste \nthat's of course different when we're \ndealing with um \na vector search engine because now we \njust search for something in the in the \nvicinity of something and \nthe interesting thing was i was talking \nto two researchers doing a lot of of \nwork in this space and i \nlike a year ago or something i said like \nhow actually how do we know \nand he says like well intuition right so \nif i if i type in \nlandmarks in paris and i happen to have \na document about the eiffel tower and it \nreturns the eiffel tower or then it's \nour human intuition that says like oh \nyeah \nthat that makes that makes sense so \none of the things that we're playing \nwith \nis that we're saying like well we are \nreturning of course in the results also \nthe what we like to call certainty which \nis a little bit of an algorithm it's \nvery simple algorithm like how to \ndetermine based on the distance \nyou can also return the distance we're \nalso going to work with with different \ndistance metrics and then you can say \nsomething about for example cut off \npoints in the distances where it's \nprobably a relevant um \nresult so that's that's the first part \nof my answer the second part of my \nanswer about keyword search that will \ndefinitely \nplay a role i have a um an example on \nthe um \nin the in the in the demo data set in \nthe wikipedia demo data set \num where we deal with named entities so \ni i often like to take \nmusic examples so i i believe that the \nquestion that i have there in the demo \nthat it says like what was michael \nbrecker's first saxophone \nwell if you run that query you will get \nthe answer but it's like on the third or \nthe fourth result and there's just one \nright answer so what you can do is you \ncan mix in the where filter on the end \nthe named entity that's in there \nmichael brecker in this case so you \nstill have the semantic uh \nquery what was microbreakers for \nsaxophone but then you're only saying \nthe where filter this must be related to \nthe keyword match michael brecker and \nthen you still get the right result so \nwhat we see happening a lot is that \npeople start to mix in these named \nentity recognition things where they \nsaid okay if the query contains a \nnamed entity we're going to do a a \nscalar search or just a bare filter \nsearch in our case on that named entity \nand the rest of the question we're going \nto match \nbased on the on the semantics of the \nquestion really depends on the use case \nthe third thing that i want to say about \nthat that is about that word serendipity \nbecause i love that that word as well \num \nwhat we see from uh from that point of \nview is that people come up with a lot \nof very cool creative ideas to actually \nuse the serendipity to their benefit \nan example is this \nso \nwhat i did years back when i tried this \nout with creating centroids on the \nindividual words we now see people do \nthis again for example in e-commerce \nso let's say you have 100k products \nand they all have individual factory \nrepresentations that they got for \nexample from a sentence uh birth um \nembedding \nso these they have these embeddings oh \nsorry model so they have the sentence \nbird embeddings to them and now somebody \nadds something to that card so three \nproducts to the card what you can \nactually do is in with yet you can say \ni'm gonna take the three embeddings of \nthis product in that cart \nand i'm gonna represent the user \nbased on the centroid of these three \nembeddings \nso now if somebody searches for \nsomething else you can bias the result \ntowards the centroid of what's in their \nshopping cart \nso if somebody has so we we \nare about to release an e-commerce demo \nbased on this so if somebody has like um \nall kinds of sporting wear for like a \nwomen's sporting wear in there and then \nsomebody searches for a jacket \nthen you can actually buy his results to \nfor example women jackets or \nif somebody has a lot of things related \nto yoga in there and somebody and then \nyou search for example for bowl \nthen you can actually show yoga bowls \nfirst \nbefore showing soccer balls and those \nkind of things \nso \nthat is an example where that \nserendipity is actually used to improve \nthe results and the um \nand create better search engines for \nwhatever use case people have yeah \nthat's such an interesting uh like \nanother way of looking at the \nserendipity thing is the \nbiasing it with the nearest neighbor to \nfilter the search and i think generally \nfor everyone listening i'm sure a lot of \nour listeners have heard about this yet \nbut what makes a part of these vector \nsearch engines so different from say \njust running your data through your \nneural network and then taking the \nembeddings and putting them into memory \nand doing some comparison is there are \nthese uh data structures like the \ncentroids bob is describing that speed \nup these searches so h and sw is a graph \nthat traverses these centroids to help \nyou find nearest neighbor vectors so you \ndon't do order n compute that you know \ngo through the entire vector set to \ncompute the distance with everyone which \nwould be impossible for massive \ndocuments and all these kinds of things \nso that's a really interesting idea the \nserendipity of you bias it you say i \nwant something that's kind of similar to \nthis and then the h sw graph can be like \nokay great i've already built up this \nindex that already helps you do that \nkind of filtering \nso then um coming back yeah the idea of \nthe the human intuition that helps us \ninterpret these results and so another \nkind of topic and i love the idea of \nthese user interfaces for human \nintuition things like as you mentioned \nthe certainty that gets returned at the \nneural search is i've personally \nuploaded my keras data set into eva and \ni've been playing around with searching \nfor nearby code snippets in the keras \ncode examples and having that certainty \nthat matches it and tells you it's 72 \npercent or 0.72 \nas you go down and you see the certainty \nthat that really does improve the user \ninterface and it helps you feel more \nlike okay i i'm getting more of a sense \nof how this is working and yeah the \nnamed entity tagging i love that idea \nbecause you can um you can have like the \nkeyword filtering on \nto come back to the keras bird example \npeople out there are familiar with chaos \nit's a library for deep learning \nyou might want to have it tag entities \nlike use the attention layer if you're \nsearching for implementations of new \ntransformers so that attention layer is \nlike a named entity \nuh layer of the keras \nso then kind of a big a big topic to \ncome out of and then start talking about \nis going from human intuition to \ncomputer intuition and this idea of \ninformation retrieval and supervised \nlearning so i think you were really \nahead of this and thinking about this \nearly on with the just the modularity \nand the building in of the question \nanswering modules so what was your \nthinking early on with the modules and \nhow are you thinking generally about \nthis kind of adding the supervised \nlearning modules functionality on top of \nvector search yeah so that's a uh um \nthat's a great question thank you \nbut um \nso one of the things that i was doing is \nthat i knew from the work that i was \ndoing back then so basically helping \npeople to build systems for whatever \nthey were trying to solve \nwas that i knew that if i if we would be \nworking on a on a database that as i \nalways like to describe is the distance \nbetween the problem that the database \nsolves and the problem that the end user \nneeds to have solved there's a gap \nbetween there because \na very simplistic example is \num \npeople don't directly connect their app \nor their front end to weave it right \nthere's always a piece of middleware \nthat does something for their for their \nuse case like you do with any database \nthat's not different for but we \nappreciate it \nso but i tried to what i thought about \nlike so what can we do \nto um \nbring make bridge that gap right so how \ncan we bridge that gap what kind of \nthings can we release what kind of \nthings can we make to that and the \nmodules are an example of that so then \nwe said like well you know if the \nmajority of people are using for example \nsentence transformers \nwhy not have a modular infrastructure to \nactually um \njust \noffer that to people and \nlikewise when it comes to the for \nexample the hsw plugin which had this \nhere the the whole the credits go to uh \nto hn for that \nidea but \nprobably we will see others in the \nfuture as well besides hnsw so let's may \nalready be prepared \nthen we can just you know change it and \nswap something else in so it's more like \nfrom the from the inside out and and i'm \nlooking from the outside in 2d to the to \nev8 and that's where the idea comes from \nand now the cool thing is the connor and \nthat is um well i can use the word \nserendipity again \num that we have one like power user \nwho's like hey wait a second wait a \nsecond we have like hundreds of models \nthat we use \ncan we actually automatically in the \nkubernetes cluster spin up and shut down \nthese modules around we evade whenever \nwe need them and we're like yeah sure \nyou can so now we see these new use \ncases where people start to intertwine \nthe ml stuff with the devops stuff and \ncreate this super huge systems where \nthese models pop up shut down and what \nhave you all thanks to the modular \ninfrastructure that we have so i think \nthat's a \num \nyeah that's just amazing to see and and \nagain to recap this the goal here is to \nbridge the gap from the database to \nwhatever the problem the end user is \ntrying to solve yeah and that modularity \nconnects to sort of the \nchampion open source the hugging face \nmodels and it's such a nice modular \nintegration \nand yeah you can just switch out the the \nmodules if you have a question answering \nsystem that's going to be uh performing \nthe task you can just swipe it out with \nhugging face and hugging face is really \ngreat to upload your models to just a \npersonal testimony to it it's it's \nreally nice to train like a language \nmodel push it to the model face model \nhub and then you can have the mask demo \nnow they're building out \nhugging face spaces they've acquired \ngradio they're really building this demo \ninterface and you can take all these \nmodels and plug them into wev8 and the \nmodularity of that is so exciting i love \nthe modularity of how you can \nswipe out all these different components \ni agree i agree with you and what you \nsee is like not only this like because i \nabsolutely am so the hugging face \nplatform is fantastic and and and we we \nbenefit from that as well so that's \ngreat but let's also not forget like \nplatforms like docker hub for example \nright so every time somebody downloads \num uh we're slowly approaching 600k \ndownloads by the way but uh \nthat's that's thanks to the docker \nplatform so so so hugging face docker uh \nkubernetes of course we we benefit from \nthese from these platforms so that is \nthat's just fantastic that they exist \nand yes and to come back to our \ninformation retrieval and supervised \nlearning discussion too i personally one \nof the systems that first caught my \nattention was co-search from salesforce \nresearch and this was around uh you know \nthis was during peak kind of covet 19 \nhysteria where we're trying to look for \nalso whatever application deep learning \ncan be used for and one of the most \ninteresting ones was scientific \nliterature mining and so there was a lab \ni think from johns hopkins and other \npeople they tried to build a labeled \nquestion answering data set but they \nwere only able to get like 124 pairs and \n23 hours of late of their work quickly \nyou know this rapid scramble kind of \nthing but so they weren't really able to \nbuild a big data set that we were used \nto using with deep learning so we're \nlooking for these information retrieval \ncomponents and co-search was this system \nthat said here's our vector index here's \nhow it flows into a re-ranker question \nanswering abstractive summarization all \nthese different tasks and you see how \nall these different components kind of \nflow through one another and build this \nkind of complex system where the \nmodularity of being able to replace \nthese different components is so \ninteresting and so we've seen also some \nreally exciting trends in information \nretrieval like super charging supervised \nlearning i think most recently well \nwe'll talk about the most recent one but \ndeepmind's retro model \nis an exciting example where they \nrelease two language models this gopher \n280 billion parameter model and everyone \nyou know says 280 billion parameters wow \nthen they're also saying here's retro if \nyou add the information retrieval it's \nbetter because it has the \nhas the context better \nthat makes a lot of sense to have the \ncontext so then kind of coming into the \nmost recent thing and i think \ntransitions really well to weaviate and \nthis idea of computer intuition as we \ntalk about how you use these kinds of \nsearch engines and then how machines use \nthese search engines it to me it started \noff the first paper i became familiar \nwith was facebook ai researchers had a \npaper titled internet augmented \ngeneration where they're querying the \nbing search api \nto \nto do the information retrieval so it's \nnot clearing a vector search index it \nqueries the bing search api and now \ntoday or yesterday we have open ai's web \ngpt where the same idea you query the \nbing search api \nbut similar to what we're talking about \nwith computer intuition and how you use \nsearch engines they're using \nreinforcement learning to train the \nmodel on how to interpret the results of \nthe bing search api \nso what we've a lets us do is we have \nour neurosymbolic search and again \ncoming back to this idea of serendipity \nsymbolic filters traversing graphs the \nmodels can learn how they're going to \nreally query this \nsearch api so they can um you know do \nthese things like question answering and \nthen learn how to use their information \nretrieval component which is something \nthat i see as being such a powerful \nsupercharger of this yeah no i i agree \nand i think so what's interesting about \nwhat you're saying um right there is \nthat from a from a research perspective \ni completely get this right because you \ntry to solve a problem and then there's \nthe bing api \nto give you these results but if we look \nat one there was also one of the eye \nopeners that i had that was like \num \nlet's if we would have if it would live \nin a world where all data would be \npublicly available \nthen there would be no room for \nexistence for something like we've hit \nbecause you just go to bing or to google \nand you find anything right \nso the idea is that i that i had was \nlike so how much data are we talking \nabout actually so how much data is \nbehind closed doors and how much data is \nactually publicly available \nand um \nyou know microsoft and google are quite \nopen about how much data they have in \ntheir search engines and then if you \nlook at estimations about how much data \nthere's there actually is in the world \nyou get to a number of like 0.0001 \nof data that google actually has indexed \ni mean i might be a a \ndecimal point off there but the point is \nit's far less than one percent so that \nwe thought like hey wait a second so you \nhave the the data you have the models \nbut you also need that search engine if \nyou want to apply this to your own data \nso if you're like if you're a bank if \nyou're an insurance company if you have \na startup with with which that's \ngenerating their own data \nand \nand that is what plays so well together \nwith these existing models that are \ntrained on this um \nthe information that's publicly \navailable and \ni think one of the one of the things \nthat i often am in discussion about with \nwith people \nis the whole concept of fine-tuning \nright so \nand that i say \ni i understand the academ the academic \nargument for saying like in theory for \nevery case you need to have a fine-tuned \nmodel \ni get that argument but in practice how \npeople use it \nthese general purpose models already \nbring them the results that they need \nand \nand i think that based on these examples \nthat you just gave \nconor i think we will see more and more \nof these general purpose models as i \nlike to call them being used by more and \nmore people because they are already \ngiving them the results that they need \neven if they are trained on \nstuff or getting to results that come \nfrom the bing api or whatever they are \ncoming from right or \nthe common crawl or those kind of things \nso \num i think the point i want to make is \nthat i think like the the \ntrend that i think that i see in the \nusage of these models \nis that because these models become so \nmuch better over time \nusing them for general purpose use cases \nbecomes easier and easier as well so you \nneed to do less you don't you don't need \na phd anymore basically to um \nuse such a model for your for your \nbusiness or whatever you \nyeah i think okay so i'm gonna push a \nlittle back on the fi on the abandoned \nfine-tuning idea and i i thought you \nwould i thought you would \nbring it on yeah so uh so i'll go \nthrough a list of citations and the \nfirst of which is uh don't stop \npre-training it was one of the acl 2020 \nbest paper rewards or it says you know \nbasically they set up their data set of \nyou have news articles imdb movie \nreviews biomedical papers and computer \nscience papers and they showed how pre \nhow continuing the pre-training for the \ndomain of interest is extremely useful \nbut \ni think and and i do agree with this \nidea that foundation model these bigger \nmodels on more data are more generally \nuseful but so i think the next paper \nthat we can kind of learn from is i \nthink it's the allen institute \nwhy is ft i've made a paper a video \nexplaining this paper on my youtube \nchannel if interested and what it is is \nit shows this relationship between these \nlarge pre-trained models and then these \nfine-tuned models with respect to in \ndistribution accuracy and out of \ndistribution generalization and \nflexibility so if you fine-tune the \nmodel basically and the algorithm is \nthat you fine-tune the model and then \nyou have a weight space ensemble along \nthe path from the fine-tuned model from \nthe original starting point \nso i think that that \nis going to be a very successful way to \ntrade off the out of distribution the \ngeneralization the flexibility of these \nlarge pre-trained models but then you \nalso want to have you know your \nin-distribution kind of fine-tuned \nnature and i i guess generally as a phd \nstudent it does kind of break my brain \nthe idea that some kind of general model \ncould be better than you know fine tune \non a particular data distribution that \nidea doesn't really make sense to me but \ni guess it \nyeah let me let me let me try to to to \nto pitch it to you right so what the \nidea is what's happening there so \nlet's go back to that example that i \nthat i gave off that we were searching \nfor \nwhat was michael brecker's first \nsaxophone right so with this out of the \nbox model based on a wikipedia data set \nwe do not find the answer so from from \nfrom an um \nfrom from an academic perspective if you \nhave defined \nyour research as can i find a answer to \na natural language question based on \nthis data set it would say no because \nit's it's not there right the answer is \nnot there however \nif you then take off your \nscience hat and you put on your \nengineering hat you can say like well \nwait a second \nthe answer was actually in the in the \ntop five results it just wasn't the \nfirst one \nso if i now run these five answers to \nthe q a module \nand i see what the highest stance what \nthe highest certainty answer is there \nthen i do get the right answer \nso you can engineer your way \nto getting the answer \nand \nwhat i'm trying to say is \nyes i agree that in the ideal world that \nis solved on the academic level \nhowever the models are already good \nenough \nto solve it \nto solve people's use cases so the \nquestions that people have so i agree \nwith your remark \nyou're absolutely right but i'm i'm \nlooking at it from a different \nperspective i'm looking at from the \nperspective of is the model already good \nenough \nto solve \nthe problem that a that this person has \nand the reason why i'm talking about \nthis and i'm doing this and i'm saying \nair quotes when i talk about general \npurpose models \nis that we see that if you engineer your \nway out of it \nthese general purpose models actually \ncan perform better \nnot on every use case of course but on \nnews articles products uh those kind of \nthings \nthen if we extra fine-tune it on these \num uh \non specific data sets of course \nfine-tuning is always better but that's \nnot always an option so i'm i'm trying \nto say like what i love to see is like \nthat you have like the scientific side \nand the engineering side and they go \nhand in hand and they help each other to \nto have these end users build \nwell whatever they want to build with \nthese kinds of databases and models \ncombined yeah so so my take on the \nengineering solution and thanks to dr \nmohit bonsal from the university of \nnorth carolina for sharing this paper \nwith me and helping me think about these \nthings is so their recent paper is vnl \nadapter so we're setting things like \ncompactor adapter high performer these \nare strategies for how we can fine tune \nclip while only really tuning four \npercent of the so particularly this \npaper they only need to fine tune four \npoint four percent of the parameters of \nclip to still retain the full \nperformance as if you fine-tune this \nwhole model so from the engineering \nperspective of that headache of trying \nto store the thing and do that fine \ntuning thing and all that kind of stuff \nthese compact adapter layers are \ndefinitely pushing that in the right \ndirection but then to kind of come back \nto one thing that i was curious about on \nthis idea when uh you mentioned that \nlike the the answer isn't in the data \nset the foundation model was say trained \non what do you think about say \nsay your goal is um is the we vva \ndocumentation right so you're training a \nquestion answering system on the we va \ndocumentation \nthen i think you need some fine tuning \nright to navigate the webview \ndocumentation because it hasn't seen \nthat data before \nso yes yes and no so so yes it always \nmakes the results better but again \nthat's so it it we need to be clear \nabout what we define what the right \nanswer is so \ni define the right answer it's like \ncan we algorithmically get to the right \nanswer in a decent amount of time \nwhich is different than \ndoes the model directly produce the \nright results and um so if you if you go \nfor the latter one then the answer is \nyes you must fine tune it \nif you go for the pre for the for the \nfirst one then you don't necessarily \nhave to fine tune it \nit will be it will yield better results \nbut you don't necessarily \nhave to do this and \ni know that i'm i know that i'm trying \nthat i'm throwing a rock in the pond by \nsaying this but the \nthe the the point that i want to make is \nthat \nis actually a very optimistic point is \nthat \nthese models are already so good \nthat they are helping a lot of people \nalready and \nyes making them better \nwill bet everybody will benefit from \nthis but i let me let me put it like \nthis so \nthe the other day so a metaphor for this \nright so the other day i was um i was \nmaking risotto and i have like certain \ningredients that i have in when i make a \nrisotto so i was getting the stuff and i \nwas getting and then i wanted to have a \nspecific type of cheese \nso i so i you know i mean in store and i \nwant to buy the cheese and guys like ah \nwe're out of this cheese \nso now the question is like so from a \nfrom a um \nuh \nair quotes academic perspective i can't \nmake my risotto anymore because i need \nto have this cheese to go in the risotto \nbut if not put on my engineering it's \nlike so what do you do you have like \nsimilar cheeses and i got like yeah you \nknow if you use this kind of wine you \ncan use this kind of cheese as well \nso i couldn't make my risotto as i \noriginally intended \nbut from an engineering perspective i \njust used the different cheese and the \npeople who ate the risotto still were \nhappy with the risotto that i came up \nwith and \nthat is what i meant is that i am very \ninterested \nin how can we get these models and the \nthings they can do with them to the \ndatabase \ninto the hands of as many people as \npossible \nand \npart of that comes with the engineering \naround it and saying like hey these \nmodels are so sentence birds for example \nso many people are benefiting from that \nwithout touching the model once because \nthey don't know how to do it right so \nthey go like i want to build this cool \napp i want to build a cool uh \nsolution i'm going to get a website or \nwhatever \nand i just want to use that model and \nthey go like wow it works so all the \nkudos to the team that that worked on on \nsentence board but i again i want to \nmake this optimistic \num \n[Music] \nyour point then say like so it's already \nbringing so much value to people \neven though from an academic perspective \nit can still be better \nyeah i think yeah i think we're \ndefinitely on the same page with the two \ndifferent kinds of like most \napplications yeah like right out of the \nbox the sentence bird is so great and \nit's so interesting if you have that \nhuman intuition and then on the academic \nside as we you know look at things like \nwhat deep mind is doing what openai is \ndoing and our creativity goes crazy and \nwe think you know computer intuition the \ncomputers are going to be able to do all \nthese tasks and we get so excited about \nthat idea and then i think we think \nabout two different ways of using we vva \nwhere on the left hand for where you \nhave some use case and you have the \nhuman intuition already you just the end \nto end system is good whereas i think \nthe other side you're looking at the \npython client the api and how you can \nput that sorry how you can put that into \nyour into your training workflows and do \nresearch with it because it's a really \nexciting uh research platform we've it \nis like a product and it's like a \nscience platform the science platform is \nreally what excites me a lot as my \ncoming from my background and so i think \nthe transition let's talk about the \ndemos that we have and the apis that are \navailable for the demos and how this \nenables this kind of research so so with \nthe demos we have uh wikipedia and \nwikidata and you can you talk about your \nconversations with wikidata and how \nexciting that's all been yeah that is \nthat is fantastic because the so \nthere was like so the wiki data it's \nactually funny story because um \ni found this repo \nfrom \nfacebook research or meta research \none of the two \num \nwhere they had this this big graph \ndata set that they trained on \nwikidata and \nso one of the things that i constantly \ndo is that if people like something that \nthey're seeing i want to know why so i \nasked them why do you like this \nso what we noticed was that we did a \ndemo data set with wikipedia data and \nwith wikidata so \nthe wikipedia one was just interesting \nfor people to see this at scale they \nthey love it they mostly engineers or as \ni like to call them tech savvy product \nmanagers that play around with the api \nand you're like oh this is great i want \nthis in my solution as well \nbut but um the b graph one wasn't was \nanother one so somebody was very um \nenthusiastic about this and so i said \nlike why \nand um \nthis person told me the following he \nsaid \nwell he said so we do \nwe do the research \nwe generate the model and now we have \nmany gigabytes of vectors and um \nthe end the wiki entities related to it \nand we gotta kind of assume that it \nworks \nbecause how are we gonna test that in \npractice are we gonna gonna load all \nthese things in memory in a python \nscript and search for it on our laptops \nno we don't because it just it's not \npractical he said and what you did with \nwe've yet it's just you were actually \nshowing in action what how it works we \ncould actually try out this model that \nwe that we were so um enthusiastic about \nand that was such an eye opener for me \nbecause \num \nthat step \nthis proof that step that i always say \nlike you need the in this new \nml first worlds right so you need the \ndata you need the models but you also \nneed the database to search through it \nand \nwe got so much positive uh feedback from \nfrom the folks even on wikidata we were \nlike the tool of the week \nand and then you go like oh this is \namazing because people are actually they \ncan they can work with it they can play \naround with that and we're definitely \ngonna do more work on making that data \nset better we're just going to keep that \ncompletely open source for people to \nplay around with it i even already know \nabout people who reached out to me that \nare \nchanging it they forked it and they're \nchanging it to build it even in their \nown solutions and our own products and i \nwas like yes that's exactly what we want \nand i hope that that early next year i \ncan share some more cool things about \nthis as well yeah it's so cool seeing \nthe graph embeddings and really looking \nthrough graph embeddings \nwikidata is probably the best example \nmaybe like if we constructed a twitter \ngraph where it's people who follow you \nand then your nearest twitter neighbor \nor something like that would be another \nway of seeing these graph embeddings in \naction because when you pointed me in \nthe direction of pytorch big graph that \nwas really the first time i'd really \nlooked at uh pi source big graph do you \nhave any other kind of like examples of \ngraph embeddings that inspire your \nexcitement about these kinds of ideas \nlike wikidata graph embeddings yeah so i \nso sometimes the ideas come from data \nsets that i see sometimes the ideas come \nfrom the models that i see \nso i was immediately intrigued by a \nmodel which is called cyborgs and cyborg \nis it factorizes cyber security \nlogs \nand bear in mind so what the problem \nthere is so the problem is um that if \nsomething comes from like a weird ip \naddress you can immediately block it \nbut if something else is happening that \nyou can't solve algorithmically and a \nhuman needs to look at it that's an \nopportunity to do something with these \nembeddings so people started to create \nembeddings based on cyber security logs \nand i was like oh boy that's amazing \nbecause now you can store all these logs \nin the weave gate and if new logs come \nin comes in you can do a similarity \nsearch on \nthreads from the past and say like is \nthis somehow related to each other so \nthat's just just one idea \nanother idea that i had was the \ntremendous amount of work that i see \nhappening for example gene2vec and those \nkind of things \nyou can easily store a human genome in \nweaviate with its vector representations \nand search through it \ni would love to do some work there as \nwell so essentially we have genes we \nhave \nsame goes for proteins \nbut also customers right so you have a \ncustomer that behaves in a certain way \num you can create an embedding based on \nthese graph embeddings for this customer \nso now you get all your customers and \nalleviate and say like how are they \nrelated to each other \nthe the graph relations that people make \nare amazing so for example \num i saw an example about like \nhotels and \npeople \nso where you can say okay i have um i \nhave like connor and i have bob right \nbob booked hotels \nnow we get like \njohn doe in \nand john doe \nbooks one hotel or behaves in a certain \nway so the embedding that's created for \njohn doe might gravitate towards you \nso then you know okay let's also show \nthe hotels or the types of hotels that \nconner is interested in opposed to the \nones that bubba is interested in because \nthis person behaves in a similar way \nthat conor is doing and this can go very \nfar this can we're not only talking \nabout the hotels that people booked but \neven how they search for the website \nwhere they where they click on and those \nkind of things \num and what we also see and now i go a \nlittle bit away from the embeddings but \nsomething where the embeddings are used \nis that there's this whole thing \nhappening with privacy and like a post \ncookie world \nhere embeddings help as well because now \ni can create an you can create an \nembedding about somebody without knowing \nwho this person is so it's very privacy \nsafe if you will but you can still give \na great user experience for whatever \ntool you are creating based on the \nembedding that you are creating for this \nuser so \nit's just there's so much happening \nthat's just fantastic yeah graph \nstructure data representations is such \nan exciting idea and uh shout out to \nzach jost at uh welcome ai overlords is \nhis youtube channel and uh he's working \non this problem of like fraud detection \ncyber security and how you can make it a \ngraph structured problem really \ninteresting idea and all sorts of \ncontent about graph neural networks \ngraph data is kind of the \nmost natural way to represent some kind \nof data and yeah biology the protein \nprotein interaction networks the drug \ntarget \ndrug repurposing being like the big \napplication sort of to look at \nall these kind of graph structure data \nis so interesting when i first was uh \nlooking at graph structured data i was \nthinking in this context of like system \none system two kind of thinking back \nwhen that um when that book thinking \nfast and slow came out and that was kind \nof an exciting idea in deep learning \nresearch and so i always thought of \ngraph structure data as being like the \nsystem two component and kind of like \ncausal inference like the way that we \nyou know if we talk about information \nretrieval and then supervised learning \nbeing like system one is information \nretrieval system two is uh supervised \nlearning reasoning say i always thought \ngraph structured representations would \nbe limited to that second part but now \ni'm seeing more how \ngraph structure can help you build the \nembeddings of the data as well as sort \nof like raw text representations so one \nkind of question and you know \nwe can just pass this if it if you \nhaven't thought about this but i was \nthinking about like how do we combine \nthe wikidata graph structured embeddings \nwith the wikipedia text embeddings how \ndo those two things play together oh \nactually i love that question because i \ndo have some thoughts about this so \none of the things that we have within \nwev8 and that's on purpose is that you \ndon't choose a model \nto attach to a weave yet no \nyou choose a model that you attach to a \nclass that's in your weave yet so you \ncould create a weavieate that has like \nthe paragraphs from wikipedia with the \nsentence \n[Music] \nburton bettings \nbut you can have another clause in there \nthat represents the wiki data \nand that you say like okay we're going \nto use the the big graph \nembeddings to store that in the same \nweave yet \nnow now you might say like well but they \nare completely different vector spaces \nthat is true that is but what you can do \nfor example is that \nlet's say that you somehow start from \nthe perspective of the wikidata \nthe big graph uh embeddings and you you \ntraverse the graph and you end up with \nstanley kubrick as i always gives an \nexample and now you say okay i want to \nnow know more about this director then \nyou can just do one simple query and say \nokay i found this \nwikidata node in the graph now jump \nto the most similar \na note in the in the part of the \nwikipedia embedding in the sentence and \nburnings and that is they are not \nclosely related from a from a \nembedding's perspective because there \nare different embeddings but you can do \nthe query so you can say oh i know from \nthe wiki data that it's a director with \nthe name danny kubrick and then you can \ndo the semantic query that's handled by \nthe sentence birth model to find it \nthere so you can jump back and forth in \nthat graph and that's really what's \nsolved in the database so um \ni would \ni would even like there to go a step \nfurther i think that a year from now \nwe're gonna see more and more use case \nwhere people have like \nfour or five models \njust zooming in harmony in in one we've \nhit instance yeah wow that that's really \nexciting and i think from here we'll \ntransition to multi-modal learning and \ngetting into this idea of four or five \nvector spaces and combining the vector \nspaces but just quickly before we \ntransition that i also wanted to just \nagain like there's wikipedia wikidata \nand i think another problem that might \nmotivate listeners into doing this \nresearch is scientific literature mining \nwhere you have citation networks and \nthen you have say the text embeddings of \nthe papers i think that's another \nvery inspiring kind of application \ndomain i see so many scientific \nliterature mining tools out there and \npeople tackling this problem because i \nthink it's a really fun way to think \nabout it and build a research career \naround \nthese kinds of problems so let's talk \nabout multimodal learning and you know \nwe're talking about combining vector \nspaces with queries with class property \nreference class references we're talking \nabout the graphql kind of structure \nbetween different things but let's just \nkind of start with like the image text \nand the idea of the clip in the v 1.9 \nfrom wev8 and how we do image text \nsearch and connected to all these kind \nof exciting ideas yeah so they're like \nthere there are two things \num that i think are that are interesting \nto to say about this so so the first is \num \nusing multiple models like for example \nclip and and and sentence embeddings in \none we've gate i i will talk about it in \na bit but the second thing is \nthat i wouldn't be surprised if at some \npoint and this is out of my realm of \nexpertise but i would not be \nsurprised if at some point somebody \nsteps up and says okay wait a second \nwe can make relations \nusing v8 as the search engine between \ntwo completely different models so for \nexample the the the big graph model and \nthe sentence bet embeddings sends bird \nembeddings for the wikidata i can say \nsomething about their distances by \nhaving a natural language query in \nbetween \ni'm gonna train a new model that is \ngonna try to predict these relations i \nwould not be surprised if we see that \nhappening and if anybody's listening to \nthis podcast who wants to do a uh \nsome kind of a research project around \nthat then they should reach out to me \nbut to the first thing what we see a lot \nis this so \nsometimes you have use cases \nwhere \num \n[Music] \nyou somehow want to mix image search and \ntext search but also \ndifferent types of model search into one \nso so we see people create multiple \ngraphql queries \nand then you have something which we \nlike to call the the business logic \nlayer or the middleware layer where they \ndo something with these results that \nthey're getting back \nbecause um um \nsometimes somebody uh \nmight uh uh let's say you have an an \ne-commerce uh solution somebody types in \nin natural language what they're \nsearching for \nbut on the page that is being presented \nto the end user you might want to have \nnatural language results so there the \nproducts come to the sentence embeddings \nbut maybe you want to have an overview \nof three products that are \nsimilar to the image of the first result \nor \nimages that are being returned based on \nthe natural language input so then what \nhappens is you have like a e-commerce \nfront-end somebody types in a \nwhatever they're searching for in wev88 \nwe get do a sentence embedding search \nand a clip search \nthe sentence embedding search returns \nnatural language results so that can be \nproduct descriptions reviews \nbut the clip results return images and \nthen people do super cool creative \nthings in actually showing that to end \nusers \nand how they can um \nfind the products that they're looking \nfor so um \nthat's a little bit different to your \nquestion about like um uh uh those \nmulti-modals but what i meant is more \nthat \nit sparks the \na clip for example gives people the \ncapability \nto now go from a natural language to the \nimage something they couldn't do before \nand they built very cool things with \nthat and so the more of these types of \nmodels we see \ni don't know what people will come up \nwith but the you know going from doing \nsomething with video or with audio or \nthose kind of things \nour users benefit from that again \nbecause they get they get more \ncapabilities to \nget to potential results in these search \nresults so that serendipity that we \ntalked about earlier to present that for \ntheir end users and use these models in \nin in practice so \num it's not a 100 answer to your \nquestion but it's like it's more like an \nexample how these \nnew models like clip are being used and \nwhat we see people build with them yeah \nand it's so exciting like um how it \nreally enables that kind of like turning \nsay instagram into a uh like a standard \nkind of e-commerce platform like if you \nimagine the way that say like i shop for \nnike basketball shoes i just look at \nlike the standard shot where they're \nlike centered in the white background \nand they're like right in the middle \nimagine to like wanting to see you like \nwhat do they look like on the court like \nwhat does some players wearing them look \nlike and that kind of search and doing \nthat kind of nearest neighbor where you \ntake this little static picture of them \nin the shoe box and then you go see what \ndoes it look like in action so to say \nand that is a super sorry for quickly \ninterrupting but i love this example \nbecause that is exactly the example \nwhere you have multiple models in the \ndatabase \nzooming you know and just constantly \ncreating these vectors but that allows \nyou to create these kinds of \napplications and exactly the example \nthat you just gave \nwas hard to achieve \nif not impossible without clip but now \nwith clip you can do these kind of \nthings um on the fly so that's nice yeah \nand clip this has to be in like the top \n10 \nbreakthroughs it's such an exciting kind \nof thing it really definitely is \nyeah so i agree \nyeah and then so just like two other \nthings i wanted to just touch on it's \nkind of like just image nearest neighbor \nsearch but also with the metadata \nannotation and coming back to \nneurosymbolic search where you know \nwe're talking about text neurosymbolic \nsearch which is kind of obvious because \nyou put the regular expression so to say \nand it's in the original data point it's \nnot really like metadata compared to say \nwhen you have an image and then you have \nthe metadata so to give an example of \nwhat i'm working with with the kova 19 \nconvalescent plasma therapy thing that i \nmentioned earlier we have chest x-rays \nand we want to it's kind of like this \nidea of precision medicine enabled with \nvector search where we want to try to \nfind like the nearest patient who had a \nsimilar experience to you and kind of \nwhat treatment worked for them and \nsearch through these large large \ndatabases and see you know how we can \ncustomize your treatment so to say so \nwhen we're searching for nearest chest \nx-rays maybe that's something we're \ninterested in we could add the metadata \nlike whether you're a cancer patient as \nwell whether you had some kind of \npre-existing heart condition and that \nkind of information would be really \nuseful for interpreting these kinds of \nmedical images and that kind of idea \nanother interesting idea is this new \ndata set that's being led it's ton of \ntons of researchers i think stanford \nberkeley i don't know the whole list \nbecause it's a very long it's one of \nthese favorites with like 20 30 authors \non it \nbut the data set is called wilds and so \nwhat wilds is it's about annotating data \nfor the sake of measuring domain \ngeneralization \nand so we have this kind of additional \nmetadata annotations on our image data \nsets our molecule data sets our text \ndata sets and this metadata that you can \nintegrate through this graphql interface \nthat's what i think really brings home \nneurosymbolic search and that and that's \nkind of one of the things that really \nhas excited me so much about this and \nhelped me keep my interest on this \nparticular idea so i think we've you \nknow covered so many topics and about \nlike the technical ideas and these \nvisions for the future but i think a lot \nof people out there would be curious \nabout like your journey as a \nyou know ceo co-founder of wev8 and you \nknow recently featured in techcrunch and \nkind of like so what's your experience \nlike with building this out as a company \nand your vision for the future on how \nthis kind of \ngame is played so to say oh where to \nstart answering this question so the uh \nso so first of all it's like \nthe joy that you have if you see like \ndownloads going up positive feedback \nthat you're getting that is fantastic \nand what you said about techcrunch thing \netc that's just \nthat's just amazing and that just is \nproof of showing like hey there's \nactually stuff happening in the in the \nworld people the mindset of people is \nmoving towards using these vectors in in \nin production and \none of the things that is my personal um \ngoal is to \nhave these things like \nfor example the research that is that is \nhappening so that's that knowledge that \npeople like for example like you have \nthe engineering that is happening that's \nthe knowledge that for example h-n has \nthe the user experience part of it so \nthat's for example knowledge that lara \nhas \nmy role is combining these things \ntogether and figuring out how that helps \npeople on a day-to-day basis right so \nthe example that you gave about the uh \nthe the the medical use case right with \nthe x-rays we we have we we know \nunfortunately i can't say much about it \nyet but we have these kind of cases as \nwell \nthe most beautiful thing is if you sit \nwith a doctor and you show the first \nresults \nand this person was does have is like \nzero knowledge about how it works just \nlike this looks great i see where this \nis going and i like it very much what \ni'm seeing \nthat is like in the in the journey \nthat's the most \num that's the most beautiful thing and \nevery week i'm uncovering more and more \nof these cases so that is one of the \nthings that i'm very excited about like \ni keep just being surprised how big the \nopportunity is there's like i haven't \nreached the limit yet so that that's \nand the third thing is like \nsome people who have looked at uh we've \nhate might have seen some hints about it \nalready \nand that is if you find a note in the \nweavier graph it has its own \nscheme created to it so it's like you \nsee we've ate colon slash \nlocalhost slash \nand then you find the node in the graph \nwell the fact that it has localhost \nthere \nassumes that in the future it can maybe \nbe something else than localhost so then \nit can be somewhere else over the \ninternet and \none of the things that is my personal \nbig dream with this if this keeps \ngrowing \nis that the big problem that we talked \nabout earlier about the semantic web and \nhow do we connect these things together \nis that you can actually say well let's \nsay that i have \na dozen \nor ten dozen you know we've yet \nspread over the world \nand i just spread a query over the \nnetwork \nand i let these models solve the answer \nand return the results \nso very simple example let's say you \nhave a vvh from the new york times and \nyou have a webview from the wall street \njournal and somebody says like okay \nwhat's happening now with covet \nyou shoot it over the network and both \nof these vp8 instances return the \nresults and you can in graphql represent \nthem to the end user so you get like a \nas i like to call it the knowledge \nnetwork and that is something that i'm \nreally excited about about these kind of \nthings as well it doesn't exist yet but \nif you look at we've hit you see all the \ningredients already being there which is \njust \nbe allowing people to connect data sets \ntogether to connect \nknowledge together to connect insights \ntogether outside of one instance and \nthat is something \nthat i'm also super excited about so \nthat that would be my answer i guess \nyeah that is an exciting vision i really \nlike that \nlike \nlike with um hugging face spaces and you \nknow big thanks to merv and omar for \nhelping me with my personal experience \nof setting up my kerasper with henry ai \non hugging face bases is yeah they're \nbuilding up all these demos of deep \nlearning models and it's all in one \ncentral thing and imagine putting all \nthe demos of we've yate and then you \nbuild a model on top of that and that's \nthat's exciting \nyeah and that is the beauty of course of \nthe whole open source nature of it so i \nhad the hugging face has that we have \nthat it's like \nit allows people to work together and \nbuild these amazing things and back to \nyour question about like what my role my \nthe only thing that i need to do is \nactually just make sure that these \nthings resonate in harmony that's \nbasically that's what i do \nso other people do the hard stuff i just \ni just try to make them resonate in \nharmony and um well some people might \nargue that but that's another \nfor another podcast but uh \num \nuh and that is just amazing to see how \nthat works and how enthusiastic people \nget about it and and that's just i \ni wouldn't be surprised if this goes x \n10 next year right so that's just uh \nthat's just fantastic yeah it's amazing \ni mean like you're definitely a \nvisionary you see these things ahead and \ni think that's really exciting to be \nlearning from you about that and yeah \nthat idea just then was so exciting to \nme and all these things so so thanks so \nmuch bob i'm sure we'll do you know more \nof these podcasts on our webview semi \ntechnology podcast i think this is a \nreally great one and thanks again for \ndoing this with me \nnow thanks also for having this \nconversation with me and as always it's \nalways great to talk to you connor so \nthank you so much \nyou \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Podcast #3: Vector search use cases, GraphQL API UX, multimodal models, and more...", "path":
