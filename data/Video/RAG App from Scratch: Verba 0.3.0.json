{"text": "Hi Everyone! In this video, I cover the architecture design of Verba 0.3.0. Verba is an open-source RAG application that allows you ... \nhi everyone welcome to this video where \nI'm going to cover how you can build out \nyour brag pipeline from scratch rather \nthan using various Frameworks I'm going \nto show you how to the architecture \ndesign in each step of the process so \nwe'll start off with how you import your \ndata chunk your data \nvectorize understand your data and what \nkind of questions that you can ask and \nthen we jump to the fun part where you \ncan generate text from your specific \ndocuments let's get into it verba has \naccess to all of the we documentation \nblog posts and YouTube videos users can \nask questions that are specific to weate \nin our various features in this video \nI'm going to show you how you can build \nthis from scratch by starting off with \nthe reader manager the way that my \ncolleague Edward has built out beautiful \nverba is by assigning an assignment to \neach manager so we'll start off with the \nreader manager and what that's doing is \nit's taking the path of the file path \nthat you may have it's also taking \ntaking in PDFs as an option for you to \nload in your custom data and start \nchatting with it in like a quick rag \napplication verba 0.3 is going to allow \nyou to upload data directly on the UI so \nin this example I'm dragging in a \ndocument called llama index blog post \nand I'm uploading it onto the front end \num what this is doing is it's going to \nimport this PDF file and then it's going \nto go through the process of chunking it \nnow I'll jump over to the chunker \nmanager what this is doing is ensuring \nthat verba is retrieving the right \ncontext and not going over the token \nlimit um so depending on the model that \nyou're using because we are modularized \nright now we're um using open AI but \nwe'll eventually allow you to use the \nsentence Transformers uh model so \ndepending on the model it has different \nuh token limits uh so what the chunking \nis doing is the first one being the word \nchunker what the word trunker is doing \nis after each word it's chunking it so \nthe' is one word then next jumping over \nto the sentence trunker once a sentence \nends it that is trunk one jumping over \nto trunk two will be be the beginning of \nthe next sentence next is the PDF reader \nand I have a video on the PDF and \nmarkdown reader and what this is doing \nis where there is a beginning of a uh \ntopic uh so like in a research paper you \nhave abstract and introduction abstract \nis one trunk in introduction is the \nsecond trunk and so forth uh moving on \nto the markdown reader what that is \ndoing is taking the heading so it could \nbe heading two and just assigning it to \ntrunk it based off of the markdown \nheading now that we have our trunks we \nwant to be able to embed our data so \nlike I said in the first version we only \nrelied on open AI but we're now adding \nmore models for you to transform your \ndata into embeddings um so we'll have \nthe sentence Transformer and the cohere \nMultiLing go model what is really cool \nabout that is that you can import maybe \ndocuments that are in Spanish and then \nchat with it in English and it's still \nable to retrieve the documents that have \num the query that still have the \ndocuments that are similar to The query \nthat you are looking for now that we \nhave our data uploaded it is trunked and \nwe have factorized it now the part that \nverba is doing is retrieving the context \nthat is important or relevant to your \nquery so the retriever manager is \nassigned the task to make sure that the \nquery is that is relevant in blog post \none is retrieved and it's not uh \nretrieving uh documents from document 10 \nper se um this is the way to just ensure \nthat your query is getting answered \ncorrectly now that we have the retrieved \ninformation we can generate text from it \nso in Wei we have our generative module \nwhere in step one we are retrieving the \nblog posts or YouTube videos that are \nthe most relevant and and then we jump \nover to the generation text of it so \nmaybe you have a query that you want to \ngenerate text from so you take given \nthis blog post I want you to write a \nFacebook ad about it or maybe a poem \nthat is what the generation manager is \ndoing and as you can see we have \ndifferent models that are enabled with \nthis um so you can use open AI you can \nuse cohere or palm and this is that like \nmodularized ecosystem that we discussed \nand that we want people to have so verba \nis open source and rather than just \nusing the we documentation you can load \nin your own data I hope you enjoyed this \nvideo and I'll catch you in the next \nupdate for verba bye \n", "type": "Video", "name":
