{"text": "Hi Everyone! In this video, I cover the architecture design of Verba 0.3.0. Verba is an open-source RAG application that allows you ... \nhi everyone welcome to this video whereI'm going to cover how you can build outyour brag pipeline from scratch ratherthan using various Frameworks I'm goingto show you how to the architecturedesign in each step of the process sowe'll start off with how you import yourdata chunk your datavectorize understand your data and whatkind of questions that you can ask andthen we jump to the fun part where youcan generate text from your specificdocuments let's get into it verba hasaccess to all of the we documentationblog posts and YouTube videos users canask questions that are specific to weatein our various features in this videoI'm going to show you how you can buildthis from scratch by starting off withthe reader manager the way that mycolleague Edward has built out beautifulverba is by assigning an assignment toeach manager so we'll start off with thereader manager and what that's doing isit's taking the path of the file paththat you may have it's also takingtaking in PDFs as an option for you toload in your custom data and startchatting with it in like a quick ragapplication verba 0.3 is going to allowyou to upload data directly on the UI soin this example I'm dragging in adocument called llama index blog postand I'm uploading it onto the front endum what this is doing is it's going toimport this PDF file and then it's goingto go through the process of chunking itnow I'll jump over to the chunkermanager what this is doing is ensuringthat verba is retrieving the rightcontext and not going over the tokenlimit um so depending on the model thatyou're using because we are modularizedright now we're um using open AI butwe'll eventually allow you to use thesentence Transformers uh model sodepending on the model it has differentuh token limits uh so what the chunkingis doing is the first one being the wordchunker what the word trunker is doingis after each word it's chunking it sothe' is one word then next jumping overto the sentence trunker once a sentenceends it that is trunk one jumping overto trunk two will be be the beginning ofthe next sentence next is the PDF readerand I have a video on the PDF andmarkdown reader and what this is doingis where there is a beginning of a uhtopic uh so like in a research paper youhave abstract and introduction abstractis one trunk in introduction is thesecond trunk and so forth uh moving onto the markdown reader what that isdoing is taking the heading so it couldbe heading two and just assigning it totrunk it based off of the markdownheading now that we have our trunks wewant to be able to embed our data solike I said in the first version we onlyrelied on open AI but we're now addingmore models for you to transform yourdata into embeddings um so we'll havethe sentence Transformer and the cohereMultiLing go model what is really coolabout that is that you can import maybedocuments that are in Spanish and thenchat with it in English and it's stillable to retrieve the documents that haveum the query that still have thedocuments that are similar to The querythat you are looking for now that wehave our data uploaded it is trunked andwe have factorized it now the part thatverba is doing is retrieving the contextthat is important or relevant to yourquery so the retriever manager isassigned the task to make sure that thequery is that is relevant in blog postone is retrieved and it's not uhretrieving uh documents from document 10per se um this is the way to just ensurethat your query is getting answeredcorrectly now that we have the retrievedinformation we can generate text from itso in Wei we have our generative modulewhere in step one we are retrieving theblog posts or YouTube videos that arethe most relevant and and then we jumpover to the generation text of it somaybe you have a query that you want togenerate text from so you take giventhis blog post I want you to write aFacebook ad about it or maybe a poemthat is what the generation manager isdoing and as you can see we havedifferent models that are enabled withthis um so you can use open AI you canuse cohere or palm and this is that likemodularized ecosystem that we discussedand that we want people to have so verbais open source and rather than justusing the we documentation you can loadin your own data I hope you enjoyed thisvideo and I'll catch you in the nextupdate for verba bye", "type": "Video", "name": "RAG App from Scratch: Verba 0.3.0", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbR0l4OKzzI", "timestamp": "", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
