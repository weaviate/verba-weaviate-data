{"text": "Weaviate Academy Unit 2: Aggregate. \nhey there to welcome back in this video we'll introduce you to aggregate queries a powerful way to compile information from multiple objects and gain insights from your data aggregate queries allow to combined information from several objects into a single one providing you with an overview of the group this is especially useful when you want to extract insights that describe the results set as a whole such as how the search results might differ from the rest of the data set the Syntax for aggregate queries is similar to get queries but there are some key differences let's take a look at the basic Syntax for an aggregate query with aggregate queries you can retrieve what we call Meta properties such as the count as well as aggregations of each properties now as you might imagine different operations are available to you depending on the data type of the property while we could aggregate numbers to obtain the mean maximum or the minimum we couldn't do that for texts and similarly operations like getting count of tokens would only be available for texts in other words the available aggregations depend on the data type of the property being queried you can also use Vector search parameters like near text in an aggregate query but because Vector search finds objects by degrees of similarity it doesn't exclude any objects so when performing aggregations with a vector search it is crucial that you do what's called limiting the search Space by setting an explicit limit or threshold with the limit or distance argument for example to further refine your aggregate queries you can use the group by argument this allows you to compile information from multiple subsets results based on specified properties the aggregate function is a powerful tool that helps you to compile and information from multiple objects you can use it to gain an overview of the search results or even subsets of results whether by themselves or in comparison to the rest of the data set you can use them with Vector search parameters as well as filters which you'll learn about in the next section and remember that with aggregate queries it is very important to limit search space with some sort of a threshold that's it for this video on aggregate queries and waviate thanks for watching and we'll see you soon ", "type": "Video", "name": "queries__aggregate", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi3DG6XJkmA", "timestamp": "", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
