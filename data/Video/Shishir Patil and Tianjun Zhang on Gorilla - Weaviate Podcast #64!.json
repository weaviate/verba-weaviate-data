{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the 64th Weaviate Podcast with Shishir Patil and Tianjun Zhang, co-authors of ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching the wva podcast I'm super \nexcited to welcome the co-authors of the \ngorilla large language model shashir and \nTian JN this is one of the most exciting \nlarge language models out there I think \nit's so cool how this enables large \nlanguage models for Tool use and all \nsorts of exciting topics so before \ndiving into it shashir and tanen thank \nyou so much for joining the weba podcast \nyeah thank you so much for having us \nConor appreciate it and looking forward \nto it awesome so could we kick this off \nwith kind of like this uh LOL LS for \nTool use kind of like treating tool use \nand properly formatting API calls is \nkind of like a new task in deep learning \nthis vision of gorilla being the a the \nAPI app store for llms I think it's such \na compelling Vision could you kind of \nyou know tell the story of \ngorilla yeah for sure uh so I think the \nstart off sometime around the end of \nlast year uh maybe November December \n2022 when there was like you know Char \nwas the rage and lot of people were \ntrying it including us uh and as some \nearly adopters what we soon realized was \nthat like a lot of uh these tools at \nleast from a chatting modality was good \nto maybe as a demonstration of the \ntechnology of what LMS can do but we \nfelt that probably this is not what the \nfuture would look like right in our \nminds an llm is a powerful tool powerful \nnonetheless but still a tool right and \nthen now you need to have tools need to \ninteract with other tools to get more \nstuff done and in computer science uh \nthe way different tools interact with \neach other is through API calls and \nthat's that was The Germ of the idea \nwhere we were like hey you know this is \na tool this needs to talk to other \napis um and that's how we got started so \nthis was like the original uh the story \nof the origins of \ncorilla yeah amazing I love that um like \nthe the video demo you have where you \nshow like how it can use a CLI like you \nyou have this example where in natural \nlanguage you ask I want to download the \ngorilla data set from an S3 bucket and \nall those API requests all that \nintermediate orchestration is handled by \nthis model and uh T and I remember when \nwe met at Berkeley you you showed me \nthis like GitHub CLI and how it can \nformat the GitHub CLI request could \nmaybe talk a little more about the \nparticular kind of apis that you you two \nhave started to explore uh using Gorilla \nfor yeah so we have been initially \nbecause as a PhD and also machine \nlearning researchers for the paper side \nwe choose hugging phase models and also \ntensorflow and also torch up so those \nmodels are pretty particular for um \nmachine learning audience and usually \nthe case is like they know they want to \nknow actually some model they use for \nimage classification but not exactly \nwhat model they want they may also have \nsome uh specific requirements for \nespecially the model size I oh I want a \nsmaller model under 10 million \nparameters or I want specific the resent \nfamily or what so on so forth so that's \nalso some constraint uh that's for the \npaper side and the afterwards we're kind \nof moving towards uh think about how \npeople in general are having a pretty uh \nit's just having not very good \nparticular sense of what the exact um \nAPI to use the kind sort of remembers \nsomething as also we discussed a little \nbit with shishir and the \nespecially for this GitHub stuff right \nyou want to know if I want to check out \nsome of the project base last Friday you \nsort of know the command basically \nroughly but not the exact command also \nsomething like kubernetes AWS so that \nhas been our Focus for the second wave \nespecially in terms of the gorilla SI we \nhave been working on the Linux command \nline uh GitHub and the AWS Ager um also \nthe gcp \ncetes is uh kind of the supports we are \nhaving from \nthere yeah that's really I mean I love \nthat so much I think all the time I have \nlike you know I might have like a \npicture of this podcast thumbnail and \nI'd be like could you make a poll \nrequest to the we v. website to add this \nto the podcast and it's like that little \nlike the little bit of doing the new \nbranch and then putting it in that part \nall it's like a bit of overhead that \nthis gorilla model I think can just \nsimplify that uh dramatically and I \nthink you know I really want to dive \ninto kind of using Gorilla for the we8 \napis but I guess kind of I want to take \napart a little like in the gorilla paper \nyou have the torch Hub tensor Hub \nhugging face as you mentioned you \nspecify kind of like what model you want \nto use and it has constraints like you \nknow I need a 85% Plus image net \naccuracy res net but please make it like \nless than 20 million parameters so I \ndon't have to like break my bank serving \nthis and then there's kind of like the \napis like you know GitHub kubernetes you \nmentioned like get can you tell me how \nyou see like apis for you know \nkubernetes GitHub cloud storage \ndownloads and then kind of model \ninference like picking the right model \nfrom hugging \nface yeah so I think like it's It's \nTricky and it's uh it's similar in \ndifferent ways right so one example is \nif you look at the machine learning \nspace of apis that we serve through \ngorilla a lot of times like for one task \nyou have so many different models that \nthey are doing almost the same thing but \nslightly different all right so it's \nlike oh I have an optic detection model \none could be for animals and the other \ncould be for plants say for example or \nyou know it could be like different \nmodels like you know almost the same \nthing one uses a res 18 backbone the \nother us a res 50 backbone as another \nexample so the fact that they're so \nsimilar and we still able to like \ndiscern between the different apis is \nactually pretty interesting right \nbecause that's a challenging part if I \nask you to differentiate between a \nstripe payment API \nand say a gcp API it's easy to do in \nsome sense like very different different \ndomains diverse functionalities \ndifferent modalities but to say hey look \nfrom the two very similar apis can you \nnow differentiate and satisfy the \nconstraints that I give you and that's \nquite tricky and challenging right so \nthat's why uh that's also what makes the \ninitial API bench that we have uh quite \ntricky um because you're trying to like \ntease apart these differences among the \ndifferent apis that exist now on the \nother side of \nlike T mentioned it's not it's not every \nday that you go and ask oh how do I do a \ntext to speech all right but on the \nother hand you know as researchers and a \nlot of people very often tend to use uh \nall the apis that uh T mentioned so in \nthose scenarios it's like very very \ndifferent use cases like one is more \npractical more useful and like looking \nahead like this was more like from a \ndaily uni developer or like a common \nuser perspective uh but the good thing \nis we have like this Discord Community \nwhere we get a lot of feedback and a lot \nof users uh using it and so now the new \nthing that we learned is that oh like \npeople are interested in um Salesforce \nand like service now and like all of \nthese apis and like the open API spec \nand stuff like that so now we like \ntrying to you know like train models \nwith these new apis and add that into \nthe gorilla ecosystem as \nwell yeah I love what you've done with \nthat this like API Zoo this \nI you know I see a lot of the thumbnails \nyou know like YouTube video you there's \nquite a lot of reaction to gorilla and I \nthink that kind of API app store for \nllms is the thing that like the headline \nthat people are loving um so yeah so \npeople you're starting to so starting \nfrom the model apis and I think there's \nquite a lot of interesting things that \nyou've done with like the abstract \nsyntax tree for how you evaluate if you \nformatted that particular request \ncorrectly but I guess they just want to \nkind of maybe even stay on this just for \nour listeners to say like this API Zoo \nyou're building up a big data set of of \ndifferent apis whether it's you know \nkubernetes or GitHub CLI how do you see \nthat kind of API Zoo \nevolving yeah so soak the other the \nother interesting point is that a paper \nis a snapshot in time whereas the open \nsource project evolves almost daily \nright uh so so and and we have this at \nthe back of our mind uh even when you \nstarted off which was like look but at \nthe same time you want something that's \nset in stone to Benchmark against \nbecause if you have a moving Target then \nyou know how do you know how well you're \nperforming Etc so this was a thought \nprocess where you would have like the \nAPI bench which released as a part of \nthe paper this would be like one yard \nstick that you can use to measure you \nknow all the different uh molds that \ncome out and that's why we have tried to \nmake it as easy as possible we put out \nthe evaluation scripts and we have all \nthe Train the eval split neat and clean \nuh so people can try try the different \nmodels bench Market Etc and this would \nevolve much slowly right uh on the other \nhand what we also learned is that \nthere's way more apis than what you and \nme or the three of us could do or even \nyou know like a small subset of people \ncan do so the idea was that you know \npeople can contribute their own apis uh \nand then we can now use this train the \nmodel and then serve many other people \nand one thing that's critical is that \nunlike you know there's been like a lot \nof oh legal questions around can you \nscrape this scrape that Etc is it okay \nto like for an llm to learn this data \nand serve it apis are meant to be \ndistributed right like the more people \nuse a particular API the more in Bound \nit is for the people whose apis people \nare being used right uh people whose API \nare being used right so in some sense \nlike this is the incentives are purely \naligned right like in fact people \nactually put out uh documentation \ntutorials Swagger documents that other \npeople can use to actually use their \napis and build on top of it so this was \nthe idea and uh and there's been like a \nlot of interest in like oh how can we \ncontribute our apis into the API Zoo \nbecause then we can train the model and \nthen many other people can use this \nmodel uh to then you know um get get \ntheir work done with a very small or \nlike very quick ramper \nperiod yeah add a little bit also \nanother Point like this uh apis like \npeople are building apis every day there \nare new apis or or maybe even changing \nthe API versions and then like this this \nis not um one time shot uh time stamp \nlike static data set it's like meant to \nbe dynamic and people can building their \nnew apis people can update their \nversions of apis or even the usage of \nthe apis so that's also an another \ninteresting question we want to study by \nempowering this API Zoo because people \nare now freely to update and then we \nwant to also we can also study how the \nlanguage model can the to the best \nsupport this Dynamic change of the \napis yeah so it's super interesting I \nthink kind of quickly before we go \nfurther into the training of the llms \nthe gorilla LMS let's let's kind of \ndifferentiate between this gorilla LMS \nand like the open AI funks with the Json \nwhere you kind of give it like this Json \ndictionary of how to format the \narguments like obviously it's like zero \nshot versus fine tune but maybe like do \nyou have any thoughts on like what the \nlimitations of that kind of open AI \nfunks approach might be compared to this \nkind of train a llm specifically for uh \ndata for the AP yeah that's that's a \ngreat question and I think the way I \nthink of open functions is that you know \nyou know what API to call you just want \nto fill in the arguments into that API \nand you and you get the response right \nand con there's also very similar to \nwhat they did with plugins in the chat \nGPT scenario where you go and pick a few \nplugins that you want and uh then you \nknow to give a question it would answer \nwhat we're trying to address is the Step \nZero which is API Discovery right uh \nlike we have a friend who's trying to \nbuild an app and you know now he wants \nto integrate Payment Processing into \nthat while stripe has a bunch of apis \nand there's like a bunch of other people \nwith different apis which one do you \neven call right like how do you do the \ndiscovery and in many scenarios you \ndon't even know what's a good Discovery \nmechanism right like if you want a good \ndatabase on your for a react app that \nyou have on your iPhone what do you use \nuh if you're in the domain then yes \nprobably you know what your colleagues \nare using but otherwise how do you know \nso it's like API Discovery is something \nI think that's I think is an an open \nproblem that we're trying to solve with \nGorilla which is that you know you go \nwith a you go with an intent and then \ncan you get the right API and it's even \nbetter where if you can also like fill \nin the right documents itself and then \nyou just get that \nas in a single attempt kind of thing \nyeah that vision is incredibly uh \ncompelling to me and especially like as \nwe step into the details of how you \ntrain these gorilla llms this kind of \nretrieval aware training you say API \ndiscover Discovery how do I find the \nright API I take a natural command like \nhey I want to add a you know secure \npayment processing in JavaScript in \ninterface something like this and then \nyou retrieve from this database to get \nthe API can we kind of Step into the \ndetails like how you're seeing this \nretrieval aware \ntraining yeah so we see this retrieval \naware training is uh actually slightly \ndifferent from just a f so in the paper \nwe have two versions We compare to one \nis purely zero shot basically we don't \ndo any information retrieving but one of \nthe bottom neck for this is as most of \nthe language models are still they are \nalso having today is like they cannot \nkeep their knowledge up to date if I ask \nanything that is late happen later than \ntheir training data set end date they \nhave no clue what's going on here \nalthough there are a lot of the uh other \nstudies like retriever aware generation \nor um different varus of retrievers \nbasically enabling Google search and \nother various sours of informations to \nconnect between this upto-date \ninformation and also the language model \nitself but what we think the retriever \nWorld Training is like the beauty of \nthat lies mostly in you can actually \nread your documentations like you the \ndocumentations can be updated like daily \nor even week daily or weekly right it's \nmuch lower the frequency you will want \nto train your large 70 billion language \nmodel or 170 billion language model so \nwe can actually we want to actually \ntrain the model to read these \ndocumentations and actually figuring out \nhow you can from these documentations \nwrite the corresponding apis and then \nthe users or the developers can update \ntheir documentations every day or giving \nnew function names or even update their \nversions and uh this kind of is what we \nsee also sort of missing in the current \num language model scenarios because we \nhave actually identified a couple papers \nsaying that if you put a bunch of the \nretrieving results and some of them are \nincorrect or some of them are Irrelevant \nthis would definitely dramatically hurt \nthe current language model's performance \neven in gbd4 so that's the part we \nactually want to dive into and try to \nsolve using the retriever World training \nthat part of the con \nyeah and the and you can think of the \nkey inside with a with an example right \nso for example you say look I want to \nclassify uh an image uh and then if I \nand you use a retriever and then \nargument your prompt with what the \nretriever gave you so the retriever told \nyou hey why don't you use this uh you \nknow like a V Vision Transformer \nbackbone then you're like well okay this \nis relevant information I'm going to use \nthis this if the retriever is correct \nbut if the retriever is wrong and it \nsays oh you want to detect you want to \nclassify this image excuse me uh why \ndon't you use this text to speech API \nthen in some sense what we train the \nmodel to do is to actually ignore that \nto say hey look recognize that the \nretriever can be wrong so I'm first \ngoing to determine if the retriever is \ncorrect or wrong if it's correct then \nI'm going to use that API if it's wrong \nthen I'm going to discard that retrieved \nAPI and instead rely upon my knowledge \nbase to then generate the right call for \nthis particular task so there's like \nthis high level one bit information \nshould I use this information or should \nI discard this information is what we're \ntrying to teach the uh llm which I think \nis pretty critical because retrievers \nare never accurate right we we all know \nthat \nuh yeah I mean like kind of especially \nin our world of weeva we think a lot \nabout like rag pipelines and what that \nlike you might um ret like your \nretrieval might be like bm25 and Vector \nsearch Hybrid search some waiting \nespecially if it's like a you you know \nhow do I use the pipe API like how do I \nuse the hybrid search API that those \nkeyword matches I imagine especially for \nthis application but then you have say \nmaybe you want to rerank you know rerank \nwith a cross encoder the top results or \nas you mentioned like you could have \nsomething where you pass in the query in \na candidate document to the llm and just \nask it is this relevant please say yes \nor no and if no throw it out and there's \ndefinitely so many interesting ideas \nthere which which is exactly what I want \none thing I wanted to ask you is this \nkind of like there was this paper called \nLost in the middle which is about you \ncan't really just fix it by retrieving a \nlot to put into the language model right \nso like are you thinking about trying to \njust put one API in the you know \nhopefully the perfect API reference \nright the one API or do you maybe have \nsome K API to put in that input \nwindow right so I think uh so in our at \nleast in in our evaluations and numbers \nwhere so this is like basically recall \nat K right and we were like hey let's \nlet's look at recall at K where k equals \none because we're not trying to like in \nsome sense rank to retriever Etc and \nthat's also why like we do comparison \nwith bm25 which is a popular Retriever \nand then one that uses like some GPT \nembeddings to compare which today most \npeople consider to be pretty good if not \nthe state of the art and we also have a \nOracle retriever right so like if God \ngave you the correct API then how can \nyou do and the and the idea is because \nwith this we're trying to just \ndemonstrate that there's going to be \nsome noise in the process what we want \nis to so there is a community that's \ntrying to like reduce noise right I'm \nsure uh for uh for VV this would be come \nin terms of how well can you improve \nyour recall at K uh but in those \nscenarios where you have this long tail \nwhere you still cannot fit this because \nyou know the queries are UND spec Etc in \nthose scenarios can we like make the \nmodel itself robust go ahead and Tackle \nthis so if you make a better retriever \nyou benefit from it and in those \nscenarios where the retriever falls \nshort you can still determine what's the \nright analysis is and get the result of \nthe \nuser yeah and also um if this is like \nfor one of the if if you determine your \ntask where you know for sure your task \nonly requires one API but ofing the case \nyour task \nrequires um like stacking together words \na mixture of multiple apis let's say \nlike five 10 apis and then in this case \nyou would definitely need more \ninformation in your retri process there \nare I think definitely a lot of other \nVAR of retrieving process you can um you \ncan add to make this process more \naccurate but often the times it's like \num is it's is going to be a little bit \ntricky to or or even harder to deal with \nwhen you're actually your your context \nof API is requiring multiple documents \nor multiple \napis that's amazing I mean I I this \nmixing apis thing is what that's what \nblows my mind more than anything else is \nto have a natural language command where \nI'd say could you build me like a an \nindex of archive papers using we8 and \nllama index and gorilla does every \nsingle thing in the middle of that \ncalling the we8 apis as well as the L \nindex apis as well as maybe these \narchive data downloader apis yeah I love \nthat and something else is kind of like \nthere's there's this thing about like \nlate like with search you typically try \nto optimize throughput and you know \noptimize latency to make it as fast as \npossible because most of the time you're \nthinking about like web search or like \ne-commerce but I think with applications \nlike this I think that latency \nconstraint kind of eases off and it's \nway more important to rerank and make \nsure you have that top you know that top \none is really great do you kind of agree \nwith that opinion that that latency \nmaybe that this is a good example of one \nof those tasks where you would be \nwilling to tolerate a slower response if \nmore accurate \nyeah Conor this is critical for two \nreasons right one is what you just \nmentioned which is lost in the middle \nkind of stuff where it's been shown that \nif you have too many contexts uh then \nyou tend to lose a lot of information \nthat's in between um and retain the ones \nthat is at the front of the back so in \nour case in terms of apis if you were to \nlike give uh 10 different apis then you \nknow a lot of things that's in between \ngets lost uh so that's one and the \nsecond is and this is informed from the \ndownstream task right like when you do \nsearch today and if the search result \nshows you 10 different uh links then the \nburden of proof is on the user to pick \nthe right link and follow it Downstream \nwhereas in the case of like a lot of \nthese llms where if you're want to like \nchange these apis together then in some \nsense like you are going to pick the \nbest API that comes out so basically the \ntop one is roughly what matters and then \nyou're going to like uh pursue that and \nthen proceed with the rest of your steps \nright now suppose the top one is wrong \nand you have like an fail early kind of \nmechanism that's good because at least \nyou get a signal and then you can like \ngo cycle through the remaining but what \nif it's like it's not wrong but it's \ninaccurate right or what if it doesn't \nfail but then it continues on like some \nlong Loop that keeps uh regressing so \nthat's bad right because now you're just \nwasting time and resources without \nreally getting close any closer to your \nuh result SL answer than you were before \nso I think for these two scenarios \nespecially as we try to automate more \nand more stuff uh it becomes critical \nthat you get it right uh and in in the \nfirst yeah and I so I think just using \none IPI by itself can be extremely \npowerful like just you know the GitHub \nCI kubernetes you mentioned but this \nkind of like combined archive with weate \nwith llama index is super compelling and \nso I wonder about the the kind of the \nsystem architecture like does GPT 4 or \nlike you know the most powerful cut \ncapable like diversely reasoning ability \nthat LM does that kind of orchestrate \nthe intermediate calls to say like \narchive gorilla we8 gorilla llama \ngorilla or even just the same gorilla \nmodel for all three all you know train \non everything in the API Zoo so you know \nthis kind of like would you still use \nsome other language model to kind of \norchestrate the steps and have almost \nlike a you know Chain of Thought like to \nkind of do this then this then this yeah \nI think I think uh \nwe are actually not tied to um tied to \neither one of this let mean we could \nsupport we could imagine in one case is \nif you want a really complex task the \ntask involves a lot of reasoning and \ninvolves a lot of uh to like basically \nlike breaking down St tasks into a lot \nof sa subtasks and uh this involves a \nlot of reasoning then we could imagine \nlike at least I'm not aware of any of \nthe current open source model that can \nreally achieve very good performance as \nwell as gbd4 or even gbd 3.5 like Che \nchat gbt so this is like one of the \nunique benefits of even you do Chain of \nThought like this your unique benefit of \nreasoning capabilities in there so I \nwould say imagine like a task is really \nhard and you need a lot of reading steps \nCH of thought steps then probably the \nbest usage is you take the most powerful \nmodel up to date like gbd4 breaking this \ndown into some sub small steps and then \nyou could call and under internal like \ngorilla for example that can give you \nvery reliable and accurate tool usage or \napis for these small steps and then you \ncould chain them together afterwards but \nI would imagine also for some relatively \neasier tasks that involves only maybe \ntwo or three or a couple more steps of \nuh training apis then actually smaller \nmodel maybe can handle this well I mean \nwe don't have any results for today up \nto now but I believe we could uh as also \nthe open source models progress uh we \ncould do better and better in this \ndomains as \nwell yeah I'd love to hop in on that uh \nso so let's get into it I mean I think \nlike the 15 billion parameter is \ncurrently the stateof the r lolm at text \ntosql and SQL I think is a pretty tough \nAPI for this right like that might be \nlike the the goalpost for all this but \nso let's talk about um kind of self the \nself- instruct curation of training data \nlike how do can can llama 7B be trained \nto uh write we8 queries better than gp4 \nand how does this \nwork yes the answer to your second \nquestion is yes 100% And that's also \nwhat we show in the paper uh and \nobviously like having a specific domain \nuh gives us the benefit but the pipeline \nis the following right so you have the \ndocumentation and a lot of the times um \nthis might come in pretty \ndiverse uh formats and how these \ndocumentations are right so what we have \nis a pipeline for training where we take \nall of these documentations and the \nfirst thing that we do is like we create \na pretty dense representation of all of \nthis information and this is human \nreadable I think of it as a Json format \nbut Json are pretty hard especially if \nyou have code involved New Alliance and \nyou know I mean it's it's doable but it \nit might be hard to make in consistently \nso we have like uh small unique uh flags \nthat we use and by the way Al is open \nsourced in our repository so then we \ncreate like these dense representations \nof all the data we have and this \nincludes stuff like oh you know uh \nhere's how the performance metrics are \nor like here's latency numbers here's \nthroughput here's the QC etc for each of \nthese \napis um in terms of V8 or like any of \nLama index it would be like oh here's \nthe authentication that's required etc \netc and once we have this this serves us \ntwo purpose now one is I can use this to \nnow generate some self- instruct \ninstruct API pairs uh and for that you \nwould use like any Jal purpose llm that \ndoesn't necessarily have to be good at \napis but it has some uh language \nunderstanding that it can like you know \nread some apis and come up with uh \npotential US based questions and we \nfound that it's pretty good if we see \nthis with some uh in context examples \nourselves so we create a six I mean \nthere's no reason to be six but we have \nlike six instruction API pairs from \nwhich we sample three stochastically for \nevery generation so we give these three \nas you know in context learning and say \nHey you have seen these three \ninstruction API pairs now given this new \nAPI can you please come up with an \ninstruction that would be a good PA to \nthis uh so that's so this is how like \nyou can generate self instruct uh API PS \nbut also this dense API representation \nnow goes into our uh API Zoo which we \ncan then use in the retrieval phase uh \nso in the inference phas for the \nretrieval argument retrieval uh aware \nGenerations right so that's that's how \nwe use this and once you have the self \ninstruct then you would then go ahead \nand you would train the model and for \ntraining the model we use uh what I said \nis R the retrieval a training uh which \nis pretty critical in you know getting \ngetting accurate numbers even when the \nretrievers me or may not give you the \nexact value so this is the training \nphase in the in phase that two there are \ntwo ways one is where the user asks a \nquestion a prompt then you find the most \nuh relevant top K documents uh which \nwould be apis in this case you find the \ntop K most relevant apis give this \ntogether to the gorilla llm and then \ngorilla will come up with a response \nthat you can just execute the code and \nget the response but there's also \nanother way and this is the most popular \nuh among our open source Community which \nis a zero shot approach you ask a \nquestion directly to the L M and it \ncomes up with an API from what it knows \nthat can help you answer the question \nyeah I think even just kind of the \nretrieval database of apis for the zero \nshot is useful as well but yeah so kind \nof to talk a little bit about my \nperspective on adding this to we8 and \nbuilding we8 Guerilla what I've been \ndoing is you know I have a data set of \neach of the we8 search apis and then I \nLoop through toy schemas and I you know \ngenerate it for each of the schemas and \nthen that becomes the training data and \nI guess the big question that I'm so \ncurious with your perspective on is like \nyou know so so I am kind of validating \nthese queries and so on and I'm I'm \ncurious if you think like if gorilla \nwill be one model or if like you know \nwe8 llama index say rise AI unstructured \nLang chain like all these companies \nmaintain their own gorilla and then they \nkind of and then gorill there's like \ngorilla Hub where I put my gorilla a \nweeva gorilla into to then when you say \nhey uh could you you know get archive \nput it into we8 put it into a llama \nindex query router maybe visualize it \nwith a rise AI or like you know like \nlike do you think everyone will maintain \ntheir own \ngorilla yeah uh for real okay before \nthat con I I want to really appreciate \nhow quickly you guys were able to turn \naround and build your own gorilla uh we \nbecause I remember we just ched uh I \nthink less than a month ago and then you \nwere like oh what's this going on and \nand the next time you ping me it was \nlike oh we have all of this ready so it \nwas pretty yeah top job with \nthat well if I can butt in quickly I \nmean this has completely changed my \nperspective on how companies can train \nllms for their custom tasks like um yeah \nand yeah I mean thanks for that I \nbecause I just I love this idea it's so \ncool yeah yeah thanks Conor uh and yeah \nthat's a good question and so when we \nstarted off out right initially our idea \nwas that like we're going to have maybe \none or like a few models that's going to \nserve most apis and then when the user \ncomes uh we get them the apis but \nincreasingly I think \nour at least have started to think uh \nbelieve what you mentioned which is they \ngoing to have a with multiple baby \ngorillas and came about yeah this came \nout from uh two interactions we had one \nis we're part of a PhD lab where we like \nyou know like we have a retreat where we \nlike give presentations and a lot of \nsponsors and people are interested come \nin and they here and in one such Retreat \nwhere we were discussing gorilla someone \nsome institutions came up to us and said \nhey can we have a gorilla train for our \nown private apis and so initially I was \nlike well why would you do that that's \nslightly counterintuitive but then we \nrealized that the way you know they were \nlike look we have multiple divisions \nwithin our Enterprise and each of them \nhave their some API producers some API \nconsumers but they don't talk very much \nor like there's no free flow of \ninformation right even within an \nEnterprise uh it's quite possible that \nyour like your customer success \nEngineers are not aware of all the apis \nthat your engineering team is coming up \nwith so then in this scenario like you \nwould have Gorilla just have internal \napis to different teams within the same \ninstitution right that also just changed \nmy because you could do this with um you \nknow all of the functions and all the \nclasses in a code base right like how \nyou want to like if I'm saying um you \nknow with we8 if I'm like hey I want to \nimplement scan quantization or whatever \nand it's like you have to now you have \nto go interface with like how we8 is \ngoing to do that how it combines the \ndatabase with the quantization \nscheduling and all this so yeah I mean \nit's it's funny to think about but yeah \nyeah and the and the second one is what \nyou mentioned which is like you know \natate uh there's a new person who comes \nin and they're like they know how to use \nall the other tools very well but not \nthe new apis in that scenario then you \ncan be like hey you want to use vb8 \nhere's a smooth onboarding experience \nfor you where you can just talk to Goa \nnatural language it's going to give you \nan API call and you can get the job done \nso in the scenario you're getting the \njob done ASAP but at the same time \nyou're also like learning through the \nprocess right so for both learning and \nlike a smooth onboarding experience \nespecially when you have new \napis uh this would be a good \nexperience \nright yeah I think M maybe I stepped \ninto it too like I think still just at \nthat high level of uh you use there's \ndifferent like like levels to the apis \nand yeah it's so interesting I mean that \nIntegrations of like we8 and llama index \nis different from like then within we \nlike how does the LSM store interact \nwith the hsw so yeah yeah it's it's \nreally fascinating stuff um see so I \nguess my next question then well yeah so \nyou mentioned the baby gorillas and kind \nof it sounds like you also kind of share \nthis thing Gorilla by the way is just \nthe best name for a paper you got the \nEmoji and all but um this kind of like \nyeah like would there be a maybe a \nhierarchy to gorillas like like some \nlike the there's a gorilla that knows \nthat some of these baby gorillas fit \ntogether like particular like to stay on \nthis we8 maybe like let's add like coher \nlike you want to use coher models we8 \nVector database and then index client \nframework so like there was maybe a \ngorilla that knows that these things fit \ntogether as well as the baby gorilla \nspecific to each thing does that maybe \nsound like how the gorilla how the \ngorilla \nhierarchy could play with each \nother yeah great question and this is \nthe kind of research questions that we \nalso trying to understand this like we \ndon't have an answer yet uh but you know \nit's like yeah like you know what do the \ninteractions look like right because if \nyou're using like you mentioned like \njust CER for models llama index for all \nthe uh connectors to different data \nsources or like vv8 individually may \nmake sense but if you want to use all \nthree of them then what would you need \nand oh what if I want to like use this \ninformation to then use some other set \nof apis so then who's the orchestration \nengine here it's uh it's all yeah it's \nit's open research we're thinking into \nthat uh and I think we touched upon a \nlittle initially where you could use a \nthird party or like even own llm which \nis more general purpose it just needs to \nknow how to route it but not \nnecessarily how what needs to be rout it \nand it's yeah open open \nresearch yeah I guess like another \nquestion I wanted to ask so like this \nevolution of Guerilla what like I \nforecast it could become is kind of \nseems similar to the promise of hugging \nface sort of can you maybe tell me your \nperspective on Guerilla versus hugging \nface how they're different from each \nother or if you yeah or or cuz like I \ncould imagine hugg and face how they \nhave like image classification uh you \nknow like all the segment all the tasks \nlike API usage could become another task \nbut then I also think as you mentioned \nthis kind of like hierarch like there \nthere's and then there's probably more \nNuance to this particular task so how do \nyou see that kind of like gorilla and \nhugging \nface yeah I like it's also my personal \nview of things con is like huging face \nis like more like developers are mind \nsharing they're sharing what model they \nhave trained they're sharing their um \nlike basically the how the model is \nperforming on different vars of data \nsets but gorilla is more like in my view \na communication between the API itself \nlike also another example is uh I think \nthe Stanford AI tal paper they also \nrecently released open source code so \nimagine if you have a ton of different I \ndon't know language model agents and \nthen the sort of will have happy will be \nhaving some ways to talking with each \nChar or to communicating and to \neventually to solve a task like but Hing \nface in my point of view is like great \ntool for sharing your capabilities for \nsharing your results but the ultimately \nthe people or the different models \nhaven't been or it might be hugging face \nare trying to do something wrong but \ndifferent models hasn't been grouped \ntogether in order to solve a task that's \nmy opinion I I feel like in order to \nsolve a task you may need some for \nexample managers engineers and you may \nneed some salesp person and then you \nknow this is uh communication between \ndifferent levels of uh future agents or \nfuture apis like have a sales API have a \nengineer API where um various of like \napis they're trying to communicate \nbetween each other and eventually it's \nit's about task \nsolving yeah I've Loved this kind of \nlike I think GPT team is one of these \nlike viral GitHub projects that \ndescribes this kind of idea of like role \nplaying gpts I'm the marketer I'm the \nengineer I'm the product manager and \nyeah like the the way you've abstracted \nthis into thinking about apis has made \nthis idea so much clearer for me some \nlike more tangible kind of uh yeah it's \nreally compelling I love how you \nconnected it with the like westw World \npaper I never would have made that kind \nof connection but you can think of like \nI could think of shashir as an API that \nI ask questions \nto and yeah so um so sorry if I'm \npivoting the topics kind of hard you \nknow I wanted to ask about the kind of \nstructured output parsing I know this is \na pivot in topics like you know people \ndo things like look for like back tick \nback tick back tick Json and I'm curious \nlike what kind of stuff goes into the \ngorilla uh for doing that kind of making \nsure it follows the uh this the syntax \nyeah so I think this is actually a Qui \nquestion Conor um what we think well at \nleast what we are currently thinking \ngorilla is like it's definitely not \ncompatible with gbd4 because gb4 is um \nwe comparing to gorilla is like a super \nagent or it's more like a general \nintelligence bot that can do everything \nbut this has good things and bad things \ngood things is like uh it can do \neverything basically whatever you ask \nchat GPT or gbd4 it gets you some kind \nof pretty good response but one of the \num this advantage of that is um it's its \noutput is very diverse like for example \nif you ask it's um if if you just chat \nwith them every time usually if you \ndon't adding a specific deterministic \nsampling uh to G4 every time output is \nkind of is from different structure \ndifferent content but sort of answering \nyour same question it's like like more \nlike natural language but this thing can \nbe a little bit tricky for actually if \nyou want to generate Json files for \nexample or if you want to generate API \ncosts because you need to follow the \nexact syntax and also you need to get \nevery domain \ncorrect so what we think is like uh for \nthe first thing is like fine tuning or a \nspecial model for this structure may \nhelp a little bit because now the model \nknows I need to follow specific \nstructure and I don't uh um like also \nlike gorilla is doing right now it \ndoesn't care about maybe chatting \ncapability right now um so it it knows \nlike here is a structure output and uh I \nneed to get the structure correct also \nthe second point is with this retriever \naware training you're providing some \ndescription of your output like the \nmodel basically reads documentation \nknows what the structure should be like \nin your outputs so the model should have \na little bit more context about how \noutput is structured and getting these \nthings more reliably and clearly better \nthan in my point of view like a general \nchatbot although General chatbot are \nkind of can they do this task in a \npretty good manner I think well that's \nkind of the that's something about the \ngeneral chatbot and then like okay so \nthere's this idea of reflection \nprompting where I uh you know like I had \nit right at we query it didn't execute \nand I show it the error message and it \nsees the error message and goes oh sorry \nand here's the correct one and I I worry \nthat if you fine-tune the model in and \ncompress it you might lose the ability \nof it to do that kind of like reflect on \nthe error message unless you had another \nmodel that's been specialized on looking \nat the error \nmessages yeah I think I think that's a \ngreat question honestly but I um I think \nokay my actually to my study of the up \ntoate models uh even GB even chat gbt is \nnot good at this reflection like GPT 4 \nis very good it's to some extent much \nbetter than GPT Chad GPT 3.5 because I I \ndid actually did some of the studies on \nthe big bench tasks from the chat gbt \npoint of view the accuracy improves from \nI say 20% to 40% after you output the \narrow message \nbut for gbd4 it actually improves from \n20% to 60 or 70% so I would say this is \na very open like a um research question \nhere on how to on even how to get models \nto reflect itself reflect its answers \nand the getting the correction part \nbased on the error message at least for \nthe open source models because we don't \nknow how open I did that but this is \nactually a huge research question so we \nare we one way is to imagine you have a \nseparate model that can do this task \nanother way is how you can also in the \nmeanwhile not only teach the model to do \nthis structure output but also in adding \nother capabilities of to the model that \nis crucial to your task \nsolving it's also something like we're \nkind of exploring as well yeah I think \nit's kind of like well that last thing \nyou said about like the adding new \nfunctionality and kind of like the \nmaintenance the continual learning I \nthink it all becomes so interest I think \nit becomes \nlike uh novel in this particular kind of \ntask compared to most deep learning \ntasks because you have like kind of like \ntest cases like past fail whereas \nusually the generalization testing for \ncontinual learning is so abstract kind \nof but yeah I think all that is just \nyeah really interesting how it will be \nable to reflect I know there's like \npapers where they like have a they train \nlike a code repair model where they \npurposely break the code and it learn \nlearns those kind of differences and \nyeah all all that kind of discussion is \nreally fascinating um so awesome so \ncould we maybe conclude with kind of \nlike some like what's on the horizon \nlike what kind of things are you guys \njust thinking \nabout yeah I think uh one thing that we \nwant to like Explore More uh is this \nthing that we touched upon in our paper \nwhich is uh hallucination which we know \nthat it's a big problem for llms and I \nthink with you know like if you ask \ntoday oh how D before hallucinate \nthere's no good answer right uh there's \nno number as such it's mostly people \nhave objectives so we with abstract \nsyntax Tre we have like a clear PL based \napproach that you can vure hallucination \nso that's something that we want to like \ndouble down and explore more uh and see \nyou know what can we learn from it how \nwell can we extend it and then retrieval \na training is another approach uh which \nI think has shown a lot of promise for \nus uh with apis and just doubling down \non that and trying and seeing how \ngeneralizable it is you know does it \nhold as we scale beyond what we have so \nfar and then besides that I think \nthere's just like a lot of inbound \ninterest on you know what apis do we \ninclude uh and then the different \nmodalities to like surve it like we \ninitially had a collab notebook that you \ncan talk to the model and then a lot of \npeople were like hey can I try it uh \ninto my workflow so we gave came up with \nthe CLI tool and there's a spotlight \nthat we just doing some finishing t on \nthat we want to get into people's hands \nyeah so different modalities how people \ncan you know if you think of it all \nthese are just different ways to use \napis and once you have the pipeline \nbehind then you can like build this but \notherwise yeah we're committed to the \nopen source project uh so if people want \nto contribute uh we'd love to have \npeople on board and it's yeah it's like \na lot of it we're just listening to the \ncommunity from our GitHub from our \nDiscord and then just uh taking it one \nstep out a \ntime yeah I hope uh I hope we we are \nfirst WEA but I do also hope this \npodcast inspires more people to add \ntheir apis to this because yeah I'm so \nexcited to see how this kind of yeah the \nAPI Zoo develops and all the research on \nwhat happens as you continue to scale it \nyeah those are all really interesting \nquestions t let me let me get your \nresponse as well on the same question of \num like kind of the future directions \nthat inspire you the most yeah I think a \nBea down top a little bit adding sh's \npoint is like uh we have already we have \nalso received or a lot of the great \nadvice from the I think either GitHub \nissues or the Discord communities are \ncoming to us so that's also kind of uh \nshapes what we are heading to to some \nextent but in in general I feel like \nthis U RM like agencing is very \ninteresting but we have a lot problem to \nsolve to make it fully \nautonomous and also fully reliable \nsuccessful uh agent for RMS and a lot of \nthem including like long contacts also \nmemory uh sorry the memory of the \nprevious stuff and also tool usage and \nchaining together apis these are like \nalso great research and open open \nresearch questions and we kind of want \nto also explore how gorilla can better \nsupport Al not only uh the research \nDirection into this area but also some \nopen source Community like whether they \nadopt gorilla as um a back a backend the \nmodel or it gorilla as one component as \nyou see moving forward in the future to \nbuilding this RM agents to for task \nsolving yeah I mean I I I hope this \nisn't too redundant but yeah like that \nkind of long context reminds me again of \nthat like retrieve enough API references \nfor how to import data into WEA and then \nretrieve enough enough API references \nfor how to set up the query engine and \nllama index and then combine that into \njust generating doing the whole entire \ntask and one kind of forward pass and \nyeah and then that kind of I love that \nkind of thinking of like what how how \nwill it fit into the existing ecosystem \nbecause you know like I I imagine like \nwhat the I think llama index calls a \ndata agent or Lang chain is really \nfamous for this kind of agent \norchestration I think it could either \njust be like the future of Integrations \nis all these things have like a language \nmodel in front of them that translates \nnatural language into the thing but then \nyou also kind of have to have some \ndescription of like what you could do \nwith you know like you have to be like \nUA could do this these kind of things \nbefore you even would think to formulate \nthe question like how do I bm25 search \nand then rerank with Co here like it \nwould need to have some description of \nthat but yeah amazing shashir and T \ngenen thank you so much for joining the \nWEA podcast I think you have such an \namazing project gorilla one of the \ncoolest projects I've ever seen \nespecially in the space of agents and \nlarge language models so much fun \nbuilding this for the we8 apis and I \nhope people will find this interesting \nand yeah I can't wait to see where this \nyou know how this \nevolves yeah thank you Conor it's a \ngreat yeah and thank you so much Conor \nfor doing this it's always a thrill \nchatting with you so looking forward to \nchatting again \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Shishir Patil and Tianjun Zhang on Gorilla - Weaviate Podcast #64!", "path": "", "link":
