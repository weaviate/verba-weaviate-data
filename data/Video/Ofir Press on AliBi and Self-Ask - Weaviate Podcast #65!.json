{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the Weaviate Podcast! I am SUPER excited to publish my conversation with Ofir ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching the wevia podcast I'm super \nexcited to welcome ophir press oh fear \njust graduated with a PhD from the \nUniversity of Washington uh studying \ndeep learning and doing all sorts of \namazing stuff with long context large \nlanguage models as well as self-ass \nprompting and all sorts of interesting \ndetails I first became aware of ophira's \nwork from a recommendation from Jonathan \nFranco you know highlighting this sell \nfast prompting and ophir was really you \nknow one of the first people to discover \nthis combination of language models and \nsearch engines and this kind of tool use \nlike thing so I I was just so impressed \nby this and I'm so excited to talk to \nyou about fear oh fear thank you so much \nfor joining the weba podcast thank you \nso much Connor thanks for having me \nawesome so I think a super interesting \ntopic to start things off would be to \nget into this long context large \nlanguage models like what happened how \nhow come large language models can \nsuddenly take in like 32 000 tokens as \ninput \nyeah so for \na long time we were kind of training \nthese 1000 or 2000 token language models \nand for most of his time language models \nweren't very good they weren't very \nuseful \nand we were just \nour goal was to we were mainly judging \nmodels by perplexity \nand we were \nkind of looking at them as like an \nacademic question they weren't very \nuseful \nbut \nover the past two years they've suddenly \nbecome \ngood at some tasks and now they're \nbecoming useful and that's leaving the \nlab and it's starting to enter \nproduction \nand one of the first constraints that \nare one of the biggest you know \nconstraints that people run into is that \nthey want to generate a really long \ncodes file or they want to read a really \nlong book chapter \nor they want to summarize like you know \na bunch of newspaper articles and \nwith most models you're gonna hit that \ntoken limit \num pretty quickly and so \num \ngetting models to handle longer \nsequences \num \nbecame like a really important goal for \nthe entire community \num training on Long sequences \nis really really tough \nbecause it requires a lot of memory and \nat some point you're gonna run out of \nGPU memory and \nit also requires probably training on \nlogger documents but most of the \ndocuments that we train on are crawled \nfrom the web and most web documents are \nvery short they're like a few hundred \ntokens long \nand so for the most part even today \nwe're doing most of training like 90 of \ntraining \nand very short \nyou know 100 token \ninternet or multi-hundred token but sub \n1000 token documents crawled from the \ninternet \nand then we fine-tune for just a tiny \nbit of training maybe one percent five \npercent ten percent of training we \nfine-tune and longer \ndocuments \num \nand there's a few issues there that \num people should understand \nuh \nwhen thinking about building these \nmodels that can handle long sequences \nso \nI think this all begins by understanding \nposition embeddings so we can talk a bit \nabout that \num \nif you want to go there \num \nso yeah when the original Transformer \nmodel was invented in 2017 \nthey kind of gave you two options for \nthe position of biddings which is kind \nof interesting because everything else \nin the model it's like you know you got \nto do this you gotta do that you gotta \ndo this but for the position embeddings \num you had two options you had absolute \nposition embeddings and you had \nsinusoidal position embeddings \nand \num so let's just briefly describe both \nof them so \num \nwhen you feed in words to a Transformer \nmodel \nthey were like we don't want to just \nfeed in words \nbecause then it might not know \nthe order of these words \num \nif I tell it you know \num the table is blue how will it know to \ndifferentiate between that actually \nlet's think of um \nuh \na sentence where the word order matters \num what was like the disambiguation like \nuh the boy was running outside he went \nto get ice cream I think that's a great \none where it's like he is in reference \nto the boy from earlier kind of \num no but but there's even better \nexamples like \num uh \nof fear is teaching Conor so word order \nreally matters there because I'm trying \nto say a little fear is teaching Conor \nif we if we flip Conor and I feel that's \na different Conor's teaching of fear is \na different perfect sentence so for that \nso this we really need to know what word \nis first or where the second third and \nfourth \nand so on and so \nthe uh people who invented the \nTransformer model were like when we \ninput were to this model we also we \ndon't want the model to just know what \nwords are in the sense that I'm feeding \nin we also wanted to know what order \nthey're coming which is a very natural \nhuman uh very like intuitive thing when \nyou're telling somebody words you're not \njust giving them a set of words they're \nalso giving them in a specific order \nclear that that matters \nlater like this was two years ago \nwith a bunch of other people and me we \nshowed that you actually don't need \nposition on banks we could get into that \nlater but at the time they thought that \nposition embeddings were necessary \num and so they were like okay how do we \num tell the model the order we all \ndidn't know how to tell it what words \nwe're giving it we're just going to give \nit word vectors but now we also need to \ngive it \npositioning information \nand so they were like okay \ntwo here's the two options that we \nthought up of the first one is called \nabsolute position embeddings \njust like we're learning word embeddings \nfor every word right so we have a word \nrepresentation for cat a word \nrepresentation for Connor or whatever \nposition for teaching we're also going \nto learn position representations so \nevery time we input a word we're \nactually gonna it's actually we're \nactually going to be inputting two \nthings we're going to be inputting a \nword representation and we're going to \nadd to that a position representation so \nin the sentence of fear is teaching \nConor we're going to first input the \nword of fear with a position \nrepresentation for position one and then \nis with the position or position two \nteaching of the position representation \nfor position three and so on \nand just like our word embeddings start \nout with a random initialization right \nso word embeddings when we're done \ntraining they kind of have meaning right \nthe word embedding for teaching is close \nto the word I'm putting for taught the \nword of betting for tables goes to the \nway I'm running for a chair but when \nthey start out they're totally random \nthey're just in random places in in \nspace so the same thing is true for uh \nposition embeddings absolute position \nabundance they start out randomly \ninitialized but as training goes on the \nmodel learns certain properties for \nposition one it learns certain \nproperties for position two for position \nthree and so on it's probably putting \nposition one very close in space to \nposition two and three but very far away \nfrom position 500 but 500 is very close \nto 499 498. \nso that was their first \nkind of thing that they invented to add \npositionality and it totally worked \num so this works \nput in the paper in the original paper \nthey talk about this there's an issue \nwith this \nwhat if I train \nmy new Transformer model on a thousand \ntokens so I crawl the web I have lots of \ndocuments \nI concatenate all of them up into this \nreally long you know billion token \nstring and now I'm when I train I can't \ntrain on this entire billion uh did they \nsay billion dollar billion token uh um \nuh string I can't train the entire \nstring at once because that one fit into \nmemory so what I do is I chunk it into \nchunks of a thousand words I'm training \non the first a thousand words I'm a \nsecond a thousand words on that \num \nand so in the original paper they talk \nabout how \nthis position embedding system might not \nwork if I want to extrapolate to longer \nsequences if I want to train on a \nthousand tokens \nbut then process like you know write a \nthousand one tokens of code or \nunderstand a New York Times article \nthat's a thousand one tokens they were \nlike if we do these absolute embeddings \nand then \nwe try to input a thousand in one tokens \nwe're not going to have a position \nembedding for word a thousand and one \nand \nthey recognize that this is going to be \nan issue \nand so they were like okay \nuh let's have another thing \nand that's uh the sinusoidal position of \nbangs \nso our issue with absolute position of \nbettings was that we had a position \nembedding for each word \nthat was trained and then when we wanted \nto look at more words than we saw uh \nduring training we just didn't have a \nposition of anything and so they saw \nthis by having a non-parametric function \nso that's just a fancy word for saying \nthat we're going to have a function now \nthat has no learned \num parameters \nit's a it's like a deterministic like \nyou can write it up in Python there's \nnothing learned in there and that \nfunction \nit takes a number in int and it returns \na vector such that \num \npositions into that are close by \nget mapped to vectors that are \nclose by in Vector space \nthat's it so we're not going to get into \nall the math behind how they wrote this \nfunction \num \nbecause it's not super necessary to \nunderstand intuition here what's needed \nis just to understand that \nthey have this function and you give it \nlike you say hey what's the vector for \nposition 15 and it's like here it is \nwhat's effective for position 16. and \nthe promise to you is that the vectors \nthat they return are going to be close \nin space for positions that are closed \nup so those are the sinusoidal position \nembeddings \nand they also worked in the original \nTransformer paper \num \nand \num \nyeah that's it so the Transformer paper \nin the original paper they actually did \nnot look \ninto figuring out whether it the \nsinusoidal position embeddings enable \nextrapolation in practice they enable it \nin theory because before right we were \ntraining a thousand tokens and then we \nwould want to feed token a thousand and \none \nbut we didn't have one because we didn't \ntrain it with the absolute position of \nweddings but now with sinusoidal \num \nwe don't need to train position a \nthousand one we just ask for it and we \nget it so they were like this might \nenable extrapolation but they never \nactually \ntested it in practice yeah so that's \nposition embeddings is that \nis that does that make sense yeah super \ninteresting and I think um so maybe \njumping ahead to The Alibi attention and \nthe way I understand you know watching \nyour video is that the the way is you \njust kind of do you know okay the the \nquery times the key minus three minus \ntwo minus one to kind of do it back but \nI guess kind of as we're talking about \nthis positional embedding stuff I'm \nstill kind of missing the piece of my \nknowledge that understands \num how the kind of quadratic attention \nplays into this is like is this is Alibi \nthis kind of position embedding coupled \nwith some kind of new uh attention \noperation like what happened to that \nquadratics you know N squared attention \nthat meant that you couldn't have long \nuh inputs \nright that's a great question \num \nso \nlet me piece that back into the the \noriginal story so \nwhen the original Transformer was \nintroduced they talked about how \nsinusoidal position embeddings might \nenable extrapolation in Alibi we show \nthat they actually \ndon't in practice enable extrapolation \num \nand \nand now I'll talk about the quadratic \nthing so yeah for a long time a lot of \npeople were talking about how a major \nproblem with attention \nis that \num \nit takes quadratic time in the length of \nthe input sequence but that's \nnot actually a problem in practice \nif you look at like a seven billion in \nvery small models like less than a \nbillion parameters attention might be \ntaking up a large chunk of your \nfeeds forward computation but um if you \nbenchmark \nany model that's larger than uh like \nfive billion parameters you'll see that \num \nthe attention computation is actually an \ninsignificant part of the total feed \nforward time and I think that in very \nlarge like 70 plus billion models the \nattention the total time spent on \nattention \nis less than one percent of the total \nfeeds forward so I know that it looks \nkind of scary because theoretically \nattention is a N squared operation but \num that's like a \ntheoretical thing but the most important \nthing to do when building Transformers \nis to actually look at wall clock time \nand to Benchmark the real models \nand um it's super important because \nsomething that's theoretically o of one \ncould end up being a lot of time and \nsomething that's theoretically oh event \nsquared could end up being very quick \nand that's what happens with uh large \nTransformer language models \num as I said in the 70 billion plus \nprogram range only one percent or less \ndon't query of this but it's around one \npercent of the total feeds forward time \nit's spent on attention most of it is \nspent on the feed forward layers and so \nthat wasn't an issue \num \nI know that there were a bunch of papers \nthat tried tackling this issue by \nbuilding like linear \num \nuh Transformer models but \num yeah they in my view these papers \nwe're trying to solve a problem that \ndidn't really exist and \num none of these models actually \nachieved \nuh good empirical uh performance and so \nI've never \nneeded to to use any of those types of \nstrategies and I've never felt that \nthose were \num necessary \nso yeah so Alibi \num uh is just a position embedding \nmethod we still use the \num normal attention mechanism the the \nsquared attention mechanism \num \nyeah and you can ask some more questions \nand then they can open my slides and \nshow you uh like a brief overview of \nalibi \noh yeah sorry if this is a dumb question \nbut so I thought the problem was when \nyou're doing that query key \nmultiplication like you just can't fit \nthat on a GPU when it's like you know \n32k inputs with the embedding Dimension \nand you end up just having this gigantic \nMatrix I thought that was kind of what \nstopped you from \nyou know scaling the inputs as big as \nyou like \num it does become an issue at some point \nso it's not this is definitely not a \ndumb question but it does become an \nissue at some point \num \nespecially now when people are thinking \nabout doing like you know looking at a \nhundred thousand \num \ntokens at once it's going to become an \nissue so so now this might be \num \na research direction that will receive \nrenewed interest but all the way up to \nlike eight thousand or sixteen thousand \ntokens you can definitely fit that \num \non a GPU what can um \nbut can you also just kind of like \nsimilar to the gradient checkpointing \nand like ragnets like can you just kind \nof like you know cut up the keys and \nthen multiply the query by this set of \nkeys kind of exactly \nit's it's it's gonna be like really it's \ngonna make things slower obviously but \nyou don't have to look at all the \nkeys and queries at once you could just \nif you have 10 000 queries and ten \nthousand Keys you could uh break down \nthis computation you could compute every \nquery by itself \num \nso yeah you could definitely do that \nit's just going to be slower but yeah if \nyou have a really if you need to attend \nover a really large \ninput you could definitely break it down \nyeah really cool so maybe we could hop \ninto the slides now and um yeah let's do \nit as Opie are setting up with this I'd \nsay to our web podcast listeners we're \ntrying a new recording software and so \nif you like this kind of like half \npodcast half like show something visual \nyou know please let us know in the \ncomments and and then we'll stick with \nthis kind of format but yeah it's super \ncool I think this will be fun to kind of \nyou know go between conversation and \nmaybe looking at something because I do \nthink \na lot of conversation topics especially \nlike as we're talking about positional \nembeddings maybe kind of like seeing \nsomething might help help the \nconversation click maybe not uh great \nfor like you know people who like to \nlisten to pot I think like \nhopefully the commentary over the slides \nalso will still make this work even if \nyou're like you know listening to this \nat the gym or something where you don't \nreally like the visual component of the \npodcast but yeah it's really interesting \nyeah I'll try to \num \ndescribe as much of this uh in words \num so that anybody's just listening you \nwon't miss out too much uh anyways uh \nhere's how you implement alibi \num \nso it's one easy step but Step Zero is \nto comment out the sign of solar \nposition embedding so yeah as I said \nAlibi it's just like a drop in \nreplacement right there's like uh the \nabsolute and Senator position of \nBrothers there's now rotary position \nembeddings so Alibi is just a drop in \nreplacement for any of these \num so you comment out let's noticeable \nposition embeddings and then the one \nstep that is required to implement alibi \nis to add a bias to the attention scores \num so I just have some intuition here \nbut this is very obvious too all the \nhumans that are listening to the podcast \num if I have a sentence here like the \nquick brown fox jumped over \num and the last word is over right and \nI'm trying to generate the next word so \nover is my query and all the other words \nare my keys \nand I'm attending to all of these \nuh previous words to try and generate \nthe next word \nand as humans we know that when we're \nreading a bunch of text \nthe words that matter most to the \ncurrent context the words that matter \nmost to my prediction of what the next \nword will be other words that are nearby \nand as a as a word is further away it \nmatters less and less and less and so \nwhat Alba is going to try to do is to \njust encode \nthis intuition that all of us have into \na Transformer \nlanguage model so instead of telling the \nmodel hey this is word one this is where \ntwo this is worthy we're not going to do \nthat anymore we're not telling it which \nword is one which word is two which were \nto see we're just for every context \nwe're telling it hey this word matters a \nlot this word matters just a tiny bit \nless this word matters uh even more or \nless but and then like you know the \nsuper further away words don't really \nmatter so that's what we're going to do \nwith Alibi um and here's how we do it \nso as I said over is the last word so \nthat's a query and then all the other \nwords are our keys right so we have all \nthese dots products that's how we \ncompute attention at this current time \nstep \nand this is normal attention right so we \ncompute the dot product between over and \nover over and jumped over in Fox over in \nBrown \nand Alibi is going to just \ngently change this \nby adding or Sorry by subtracting \na bias from each of these dot products \nand the spias is going to linearly grow \nas we get further away so over and over \nuh once as a key in which is a query \nthat's the same word so there's zero \nbias and then we're going to start going \nfurther away over and jump that's one \nword away we're going to subtract one \nover in Fox we're going to subtract two \nand so on \nand this is the intuition behind Alibi \nbut in reality we actually multiply this \nconstant \num \nby \nslope it's called M here and this is a a \nnumber that um \nis not learned \nit's just a \num \na set \nfloat \num \nyeah that's it so that's what happens in \nAlibi and like the only there's just one \nmore small technical detail when you do \na tension we typically do multi-headed \nattention right you don't do attention \njust once at every time Step at every \nlayer you do it multiple times right \nTransformers usually have dozens of \nheads and so Alibi uses a different M \nvalue for each head \num \nuh so if you have eight heads these M \nvalues are going to be half a fourth and \nso on it's just going to be this \nsequence for 16 heads it's these values \nthere's just a method in The Alibi repo \nthat tells you which M values to use and \nwhat this does \nis that when every head attends \nbackwards \nto the previous words it biases previous \ncontext in \num varyingly uh decreasing weight so \nsome heads are going to \num have large biases which is going to \nmean that they're going to only look \nvery closely nearby and not really \nattend to words that are far away and \nsome hats have very very small M values \nwhich means that they will look really \nfar away before \nthe bias becomes really big and we stop \nlooking \nyeah so that's Alba \noh it's so interesting I was going to \nask if this had something to do with \nthat kind of like lost in the middle \npaper because it seems like \num you know when before you explain the \nmulti-head attention how you'd have \ndifferent values for the M I was \nthinking like well this is really \nbiasing it towards the most recent uh \ntokens and then that would really \nprobably impact how you think about the \nkind of retrieval augmented generation \nand how you pack the prompt and sort of \nlike yeah yeah so \num there's a bunch of things here so \nfirst of all \num yeah at first this kind of looks \nweird because it seems like we're \nforcing the model to only look really \nclosely nearby and not really look far \naway but we've benchmarked this against \nsinusoidal and you know rotary and \nabsolute position embeddings many many \ntimes over and every single time we find \nthat it beats or matches all these other \nmethods so even though it looks as \nthough we're kind of biasing to only \nlook nearby \nwe're actually \nwe're permitting we're letting it look \neverywhere \nand we're just using this bias \nas a way to \ninject positional \nunderstanding into the model \nkind of give these positionality hints \nwithout \nreally forcing the model to just look \nnearby it can look wherever it wants \nit just has some heads that are kind of \nhave a harder time looking further away \nbut some heads can they have this the \nspice is incredibly slow over there and \nso they can look far away and so while \nat first it might seem like this model \ncan't really look far away it can \num I think that we should look at this \npenalty of spies more of a kind of a \nhint of oh this word is further away you \ncan look at it but just FYI it's kind of \nfar so yeah so there's no \nyou don't lose anything and I mean the \nbenchmarks speak for themselves uh it \nworks and \nyeah so that's for Alibi and then of \ncourse language models \nas a whole no matter what position \nembedding you use \nhave a very strong recency bias and this \nis probably due to many many things but \num one of the reasons that this happens \nis because language has a very very \nstrong recency bias right you're \ntraining on all these documents from the \nInternet or even if it's books or \nwhatever you're training on \nmost of the time in order to predict one \nword into the future you only need to \nlook at the past five or six or seven \nwords and so no matter what position of \nbetting you're going to use your \nlanguage model \nis going to have an incredibly strong \nrecency bias \nright and that's going to make it a bit \ntougher \nif during inference you're suddenly \ngiving it like you know five papers from \narchive and asking it a question that \ninvolves kind of querying all five of \nthem that's that's going to be tough \nbecause most of the time during training \nit was like you know \ncompleting like you know 200 words \num like news briefs from like Reuters or \nsomething it was doing a totally \ndifferent and much much simpler task so \nthat's an issue \num that's a very big issue but that \ndoesn't necessarily come \nfrom the position of betting that you \nuse it's mostly I think because of um \nof how the language is \nyeah that inspires me to ask you this \nquestion so I'm very curious about this \nidea of retrieval aware training I've \nseen like you know Mosaic MPT 30 billion \ndescribes this staged training where \nthey first train with one k length uh \nsequences and then you know 4K for like \nsay the you know the first 8 000 steps \nof training are with 1K and then the \nnext 2K for that but so like this kind \nof retrieval aware training where you \nwhere you're training a model that takes \nlike 32k 100k length inputs so you kind \nof would retrieve from your you know \nVector database hopefully and uh and uh \nand do this during training to have this \nmodel so it doesn't have this you know \nI'm only completing 200 word uh Reuters \ntitles as you mentioned but it's seen \nthis kind of thing of having just an \nenormous context window right so so how \nimportant do you think retrieval is \ngoing to be kind of integrated into the \ntraining of large English models yeah \nthere's like a few different things that \nyou touched on here that are kind of \ndistinct so let me break this down piece \nby piece so \num \nso stage training is a name that we \nevent invented in \num a paper we published three years ago \ncalled short former for a process that \nwe did not invent but we I think we were \nthe first to kind of uh explore \nempirically and kind of show uh that it \nreally works \num so stage training to my knowledge was \nfirst done by Bert and um when we use \nthe term stage training we mean that you \ntrain on short sequences for a bunch of \ntime and then you train on longer \nsequences \num for a minor amount of the time so for \nexample Bert is a model that can handle \n512 token sequences but if you read the \npaper you'll notice that they trained on \n128 \ntoken sequences for 90 of training and \nthen they did the last 10 of training \nwith 512 tokens \num \nand \num they did that and then nobody else \nreally did that and then when we wrote \nuh shorts former we noticed that \ntraining and long sequences at that time \nwith the data that we had then and the \nsmaller models that we had then we \nnoticed that like even though people \nwere training on like 2 000 or 3000 \ntoken long sequences at the time we \nnoticed that it wasn't really beneficial \nand so we coined this term State \ntraining and we really explored it and \nwe showed that you can actually train on \nuh very short sequences even shorter \nthan 128 tokens uh for a lot of time and \nthen just do the last bit of training on \nlike a thousand or two thousand tokens \nand you get results that are just as \ngood \num as training on really long sequences \nfor all for the entire duration so \nthat's stage training so stage training \num \nisn't \num necessarily A retrieval augmented \nthing State training just means hey I'm \ngoing to train on really short sequences \nand then I'll train on on longer ones \num and that worked really well for Bert \nin I think it was 2018 okay or 2017. um \nit worked really well oh no but it was \n2018. it worked really well for us when \nwe wrote shorts former uh in 2019 and \nthen with Zeke recently did this with \none of their MPT models where if I \nremember correctly they traded on like 2 \n000 tokens for a really really long time \nand they fine-tuned it or they did the \nthe last bit of training on 65 \n000 token long sequences so you can fit \na 65 000 token long sequence in a gpu's \nmemory but it makes training really \nreally slow and so if they would have \ndone that on for like you know 100 of \ntraining that would just have been \nprobably too expensive way too slow \num and so uh because a lot of the things \nyou need to learn as a language model \nare really in the short term a lot of \nlearning is just in the in a hundred \nTokens The 100 previous tokens so \nthere's no real reason to train on 65 \n000 tokens for the uh entire duration of \ntraining so it was like this really \nsmart thing where they just trained on I \nthink it was 2000 uh token sequences or \ntwo thousand token long sequences for a \nlife percentage of the time and then \nthey trained \num on the super long you know 65 000 \ntoken books or whatever it was and I \nthink that's a super smart strategy so \nit's still stage training still works \ntoday \num so that's stage training and now \nseparate from that uh is the whole \nretrieval retrieval augmented models and \nthen you can I guess combine with them \nbut let's talk separately about \nretrieval \num augmented models yeah I think that \ngoing forward a lot of the things that \nwe want to do with language models will \nhave to use some kind of retrieval \naugmentation if you want to do like you \nknow co-pilot style like you know code \nassist \num for really large repos you're not \ngoing to be able to fit an entire repo \ninto a language models context \num \nif you want to do like medical search \nyou're not gonna fit \nevery medical paper that's been \npublished \nin your language models \num \ncontext window not even in two or three \nyears maybe in 10 years you will but \nright now it doesn't it's not coming \nanytime soon \nand so \num \nretrieval augmentation is just a very \nclear very simple uh \nway to kind of get the best of both \nworlds both have access to you know lots \nof content but also use the power of \nlanguage models so I definitely believe \nin retrieval augmented systems \num \nand then the question arises of should \nwe do this during training or should we \njust do this during inference and as you \nsaid if you just do it during inference \nyou have a model that was trained in \nrelatively shorter documents and that \nduring inference you ask it to uh look \nat like you know five archive papers \nit's going to have a tough time I think \nthe solution for that is to do \nretrieval augmented fine tuning or to \num \nkind of do the last bit of training with \nsome kind of \num uh log documents uh that are put into \nthe language models context I I haven't \nreally seen \nI haven't been convinced that training \nuh with retrieval for the entire \nduration of training okay something \nthat's necessary but um \nyeah I think that's something that \npeople are doing research on right now \nand it's a really interesting subject \nyeah that makes a ton of sense to me \nthat like you you want to build up kind \nof representations with the shorter \nsequences I imagine the throughput of \ngetting each you know training bash into \nthe GPU with shorter samples is easier \nas you mentioned maybe like breaking up \nthe key multiplications so that brings \nme into into your next really famous \nwork that I'm so excited to talk about \nis this self-ask prompting because it's \nsuch an interesting part of retrieval \nwhere if I ask you a question like I \nthink the canonical example is did \nAristotle use a laptop and like you \nbreak this question into the two \nquestions to facilitate the retrieval so \nI'm just so so curious what your current \nthinking on self-ass prompting as well \nas kind of what inspired you to \noriginally uh go down that route \nyeah \num \nI was just playing around \nwith gpt3 this was written \na bit more than a year oh actually a \nyear ago \num so this is before Chachi BT before \ngpt4 \nI was playing around with it \nand I started trying to figure out if I \ncould trick it \nand so I started asking questions like \num \nwhen did Israel land on the Moon \num \nwhich uh \nCanadian \num \nwas the first person to cl to explore \nEverest like all kinds of questions that \nare incorrect \nwait what did I say oh first person yeah \nhe wasn't Canadian right \num \nand it would get them wrong I mean since \nthen people have put these types of \nquestions on Twitter it's like a funny \nmeme now I like this type of stuff but \nlike people have asked it \num I can't remember who this was I'm \nsorry but somebody asked it when was the \nGolden Gate Bridge \nmoved across Egypt for the second time \nand gpt's three is like oh of course \nthis happened on like you know March 17 \n1984 whatever I don't know it's like \nit really \num \nand yeah for all those questions that I \ngave like if I remember when I asked \ngpt3 like you know when did Israel first \nsound of the Moon it would be like you \nknow \nJune 10th 1992 right \nand then I was like okay how do I solve \nthis like there's no way that \nthis can't be stopped like with just \npurely the model no retrieval no \nGoogling no nothing like just \njust the model and I pretty quickly \ncame up with a solution so \nin the world of gpt3 we weren't doing a \nlot of zero shots prompting where you \njust ask it a question we were doing \num more like you know single shot or few \nshots prompting where you would have a \nfew questions you would write your own \nanswers and then you would ask gpt3 like \nyou know a new question that you wanted \nan answer today \num \nso what I did to to \num \nto fix this issue with a false questions \nis \num I was like from now on whenever I ask \nyou a question let's break it down into \nTwo Steps step one try to understand if \nthe question is truthful \nand then only if it is truthful \num then answer it right so in the \nexample questions I would have like a \nquestion like \num \nwhen did Spain first acquire nuclear \nweapons so I would have a question when \ndid Spain acquire nuclear weapons and \nthen I would be like is this question \ncorrect question mark and then colon oh \nand then I'd be like no you know Spain \nnever has acquired nuclear weapons \nand then and then I would have answer \ncolon no answer I'm not answering this \nquestion like it doesn't make sense \nright so that's in the example that I'm \ngiving gpd3 and then I would ask it a \nnew question when did Israel land on the \nmoon and then it would ask itself \nhas Israel ever landed on the moon no \ntherefore I'm not answering this \nquestion \nmm-hmm \nand yeah this work that managed to now \nall these questions that it was you know \nwhen was the Golden Gate Bridge moved \nacross Egypt it would ask yourself has \nthe golden great bridge ever been moved \nacross Egypt no and then \num \nit fixed this this issue and I was \nreally really cool to me that just by \nprompting \nyou could \nfix these significant issues \nand I think my main lesson from there is \nthat I mean I've known this for a really \nlong time and everybody should know this \nlanguage models are kind of stupid or \nall machine learning models \nare not \nthey're kind of \ngood at doing what they were trained on \nand they're not great \nat doing things that are super out of \ndistribution and so whenever I'm prompt \nengineering \nthe thing that I'm thinking most about \nis how can I break this down if I have a \ntask that a language law has never seen \nbefore \nthe question that I ask myself is how \ncan I break this down into subtasks \nsuch that each subtask is as close as \npossible to something that it has seen \nbefore \nso asking it questions with false \npresuppositions \nis out of distribution because most of \nthe time on the internet when people ask \nquestions they're not asking these \nabsurd silly questions they're asking \ntruthful questions \nand so I think that's why it's kinda \nwent crazy and started like giving dates \nto all these like fictional events that \nnever happened it's because most of the \ntime when somebody asks a question the \noutput distribution is a date like \nyou're not going to start arguing like \nmost of the questions I mentioned are \ntotally legitimate and it's not very \ncommon that a model observes somebody's \nsaying oh actually that question is \ntotally wrong I'm not gonna act like and \nso \nthe thing that solved it was to to break \nit down into these two steps of is this \nquestion even uh \nreal and then answering it and so that \ntook me that got me to self ask so in \nself ask \nthe first thing that we kind of show is \nthat language models struggle with \num multi-hop questions multi-hop \nquestions are questions that require \nretrieving multiple \npieces of evidence to answer for example \num when was the founder of Craigslist \nborn right you first have to figure out \nwho the founder of Craigslist was and \nthen you have to \num figure out when they were born \nand we notice that language models \num really struggled with those types of \nquestions uh who was president of the \nUnited States when Billy eilish was born \nthey got that wrong and when you look \ninto it you can ask language while \nyou're so I asked gpt3 who was the \npresident when Billy Ash was born and it \ngets it wrong and then I can ask it \num when was Billy Alex born it gets that \nright and then I I take that data and \nI'm like who was president on that date \nand it gets that right too so even \nthough it has the facts that are needed \nto answer that's compositional question \nit has some kind of \nreasoning bug that doesn't really allow \nit \nto \num to understand \ncompositional questions sometimes \nand so what we did was we took this \nthinking of um uh breaking down \ncomplex things into simpler things and \nso \num The Prompt for self-ask basically \nsays hey when you get a compositional \nquestion don't try to answer it just try \nto break it down into what is the first \nsub question that I need \num to answer in order to get to the \nfinal answer so the first question in \nthe biliate case is um when was Billy \neilish born and so I'm like okay just \nwrite the first sub question great now \nwhat's the answer to that it answers \nthat and it's I'm like okay what's \nwhat's the second question that you need \nto \num yeah so who was president on that \ndate and then what's the answer to that \nGeorge Bush or whatever so the finances \nGeorge Bush so we just have uh a prompt \nwith a few examples of me doing uh this \nprocess the self-ass process with a \nbunch of \num \nuh example questions and then you give \nit your own question and it \nautomatically decomposes it into sub \nquestions answers to them and then \nanswers a full question \num and it does it better than Chain of \nThought So yeah I'll let you ask some \nquestions but I have a bit more to say \nafter that \nwell yeah I'd love to just keep rolling \ninto the \num Chain of Thought I mean I love it's \nkind of a really great example of kind \nof still making the case for a few shot \nexamples this kind of you know giving it \nexamples of when a question is \nunanswerable or you know and and \ngenerally I love this kind of question \ndecomposition I think it makes a ton of \nsense for you know all sorts of \nquestions and and you know as people are \nI think most commonly people are \nbuilding like chat with your \ndocumentation all this kind of stuff and \nyou can expect these kind of \ncompositional questions where \ndecomposing the facts is extremely \nuseful I guess yeah I I mean the the \nChain of Thought it sounds like you got \nyou have something \nyeah so so \num we talk a bunch about Chain of \nThought in our paper Chain of Thought is \nsuper super cool \nbut um \nself-ask improves upon it \num so in the paper we show that Chain of \nThought sometimes kind of loses its \ntrain of thought \num so we have this example in the paper \nand I'm not going to remember it exactly \nright but uh it's like who was president \nof the United States \num when super connectivity was \ndiscovered and we'll get into retrieval \nand that type of stuff later but right \nnow we're just talking about pure you \nknow there's just a question in a \nlanguage model there's no retrieval here \nwhenever I say the word retrieval I mean \nthe language was kind of retrieving \nfacts from within its memory or whatever \nwe're not actually retrieving anything \nfrom like a web \nso you have a language model and you \nhave a question and you ask it uh who \nwas president of the United States when \nsuper connectivity was discovered in in \nthe first uh exactly we're going to use \nChain of Thought right so we have an \nexample question with an example answer \nthat uses Chain of Thought and that \nmeans that channel thought just means \nthat you're like a human you're kind of \nsaying well uh super connectivity was \ndiscovered in 1905 the president of the \nUnited States then was Woodrow Wilson or \nwhatever so the financial ounces would \nyou Wilson \num \nbut what happens is that chain of \nthoughts others forgets what it's trying \nto do so for this specific example with \ngpd3 \nit said something like super \nconnectivity was discovered in 1905 \nwhich is correct and then it said the \npresident of the United States in 1913 \nwas Woodrow Wilson so the final answer \nor \nit said some it said the correct \npresident for 1913 but then it said that \nwas the final answer do you understand \nso it knew that superconductivity was uh \ndiscovered 1905. it did tell us who the \npresident of the answers was in 1930 but \nthat's wrong like it was the president \nof 1905 was a different person and so it \ngot that wrong it kind of it went off \ntrack \nand so what we've learned from self ask \nis two things is first of all always try \nto decompose complex queries it doesn't \neven have to be a question If you're \ntrying to build a complex SQL query \nusing gpd3 maybe try to First have it \nbuild sub queries and then combine it if \nyou're trying to write a complex story \nor marketing text or whatever maybe try \nto have it first right like you know \nthe the you know one perspective of it a \nsecond perspective then combine them so \nbreaking complex things down into easier \nsubtask is super important but then the \nsecond thing that we learned is that \nChain of Thought can sometimes be \nproblematic because it forgets where \nit's going and in general when you're \ngenerating a lot of text with a language \nmodel \nit can sometimes kind of lose track of \nwhat it's trying to do and so the second \nthing that um \nwe we think is really useful in self-ask \nis that it's constantly reminding the \nmodel of what its current sub goal is so \nself-ask gets this uh question right \nbecause self-ass says okay when was \nsuper connectivity discovered and \nlamas's answer 1905 and then it says who \nwas the president of the United States \nin 1905 and the Moss is the president of \nthe United States 1905 was blah blah so \nthe answer is and it gets it right so by \nconstantly reminding yourself of what \nyour current sub goal is \num we get the language model to be on \ntrack more and so we show in the paper \nthat our method um \nah does better than Chain of Thought \nyeah I think we all need that right like \nwhat am I doing again a reminder of my \nmajor goals and uh yeah I mean the whole \nthing it inspires my interest I mean \nthis like Auto gbt this kind of more \nautonomous AI it it you know it sounds \npretty natural but that's the next step \nI think there are just so many \ninteresting things you can kind of \nextrapolate about autonomous AI like you \ncan imagine like uh an llm that wants to \ntrain like a new LM and so it goes and \nit gives training data for this new llm \nor I think maybe just the idea of like \nhaving it make pull requests to code or \nlike you know research tasks that run \novernight or running an experiment and \njust kind of waiting for the experiments \nto be done I think there's so much to \nthat kind of like autonomous \nyou know evolution of this and I guess \nkind of um I hope this isn't too off \ntopic but I wanted to get your opinion \non these Guerrilla large language models \nas well which which is like a large \nlanguage model that's been uh \nspecifically trained for a particular \nset of apis and so kind of the thinking \nwith this self-ass prompting and this \nquery decomposer kind of concept is like \nif I need to uh split my question into \nmaybe a complex query or if I need to \nsplit it into like you know spinning up \nor like using the GitHub CLI to format a \npull request these kind of specialized \nllms in the middle seem to make a lot of \nsense and it's almost like uh API usage \nas a as a task like instead of that kind \nof like open AI functions thing where \nyou output like a Json that has the \narguments of the function you instead \nhave these intermediate llms specialized \nto formatting API requests so I'm just \ncurious if you've seen this paper and if \nyou you know if you think that this is \nan important Direction going forward \nyeah I haven't seeing that specific \nthing but I can \ntalk about my view about integrating \nlanguage models with external tools so \nin self ask \num \nwe had this thing where we integrated it \nwith Google search and we weren't the \nfirst paper at all to integrate language \nmodels with search Google had a paper \nwhere they integrated language models of \nsearch but \na lot or all the previous work \nhad to do a lot of very complicated like \nreinforcement learning fine-tuning for \nthe language models in order to get \ntheir language models to understand how \nto operate a search engine API \nand in self-ask we showed this really \nsimple thing I don't know how we were \nthe first to \ndo this but we were the first to show \nthat you don't need to train your \nlanguage model to follow a search API in \norder to understand how to use web \nsearch you can just kind of trick it \ninto using a search engine and so \nare \nprompt is very structured it's always \nlike you get an input question and then \nit's like okay sub question one \nwho was president of the United States \nin 1905 sub answer one blah blah blah \nsub question two \nand so what we did was we used the same \nself-ask method and prompt but this time \nuh so this system is called uh \nself-askplus search engine software's \nGoogle search so \nwe have a question \nlike who uh you know uh \nwhat was my question that I liked \num \nwhat is the current time in the country \nthat's hosting the World Cup \nright so if you ask \nGPT 4 gpd3 this question they have no \nchance of knowing this because I think \nthey were trained before the World Cup \nhappened and they definitely don't know \nso they don't know where the World Cup \nis happening and then they definitely \ndon't know what time it is right now in \nQatar or whatever right they don't have \nany real-time data \nand so we did this before gpd4 and \nplugins and web scraping \num and it's still simpler than those \napproaches but what we did was uh we at \nwe gave this question to gpd3 with a \nself-asking prompt and it was like okay \nthe first question sub question I want \nto ask is \num what country is currently hosting the \nWorld Cup right and that's like answer \ncolon and then we stop it so it's about \nto answer itself we stop it we go to \nGoogle we extract the first question \nthat it asks because it's really easy to \nextract because it literally says you \nknow sub question one colon so super \neasy to parse out we send it over to \nGoogle we used serp API \num and then Google gives you back an \nanswer and then we just take that and we \nput that into the language model prompt \nand we're like here's the answer so the \nlanguage model thinks that it asks \nitself and it answered itself even \nthough it was Google but it doesn't know \nthat it doesn't need to know that and \nthat's like okay uh sub question two \nwhat is the time in Qatar and we're like \nah wait a second we pause it we take \nthat question parse it out send it to \nGoogle Google tells us the answer we put \nthat back into the prompt and it says \nokay the final answer is you know 7 pm \num \nso yeah we did this like a year ago and \nit's super simple and it's really really \nuseful and it's super powerful and a lot \nof the previous approaches had the \nfine-tune language models I think one of \nthe previous papers for some reason they \nneeded like humans to like they had to \nkind of \num use like human annotators uh and \nrecord how they did Google searches in \norder to use that to like very very \ncomplex stuff we did none of that it was \nall super super easy \num \nbut yeah uh \nuh I'm \nvery much \nin favor of Simple Solutions \nI've been using \num gpd4 to write python code for me \nand \nit's almost always executable and it it \nalmost always runs and then whenever \nit's not correct I'm like hey this it \nreturned this bug or whatever and then \nit just rewrites it for me sometimes it \ntakes it like 10 tries but \num \nat some point it will return something \nthat's or I think for like 70 of my \nquestions it ends up returning correct \ncode so \nI I'm not sure that right now I see a \nneed for specific \nlanguage models for specific apis \num I would just \ninclude like the API in the prompt or \nthe relevance function calls in the \nprompt and ask gpt4 to program for me \nbut yeah if you want to automate this \nit's it's not currently \nas I said only like 70 of the time does \nit return code that runs so it's not \nsomething that would \num \nyou couldn't put this in production and \nexpect it to work all the time \nbut I I'm not \nI don't currently see \nuh the benefit of fine-tuning your own \nmodels on your API \nwell I think um to speak to a bit to the \nweeviate cases like um kind of I think \none of the big things about these Vector \ndatabases is kind of adding like \nsymbolic filters like where do you want \nto search so like you know if you say um \nyou know what what what's the latest \nopinion on Al by attention and whether \nyou want to search Twitter or or XR \nyou're going to search X or if you want \nto search archive and then you could you \nknow tailor the search accordingly maybe \nyou want to add a filter to that one \nlike date is greater than July 5th 2023 \nor something like that and then I think \none other important kind of lever for \nformulating these queries and the reason \nwhy you would want an element that knows \nhow to control the API is um you know is \nthis a vector search query or is this an \nSQL query so I think there are cases I \nlove that reflection prompting thing \nlike where you get the output from the \ncode executor and then you just keep \nchaining that and I think that could \nalso work with search where um you could \nget the search results and say okay do I \nneed to re-rank this or should I \nactually use like a hybrid search \nbetween M25 and dense Vector search and \nI think they're yeah I think the whole \ntopic there's quite a lot of uh \ninteresting things with this but yeah so \num kind of another topic is uh you know \nat the end of your dissertation you're \ntalking about new directions for new \ntraining data and you just mentioned \nkind of you know I think we're all just \nwildly impressed by how well it can \nwrite code uh and I think kind of you \nknow it's extremely powerful like as \nwe're talking about this topic of like \nautonomous AI I just love how with code \nit can run it can come up with whatever \nexperiment it wants kind of so it's like \nthis kind of expiration exploitation \nlike the you know reinforce and learning \nall that kind of coming into it how do \nyou see that kind of language models \ntrained on code and how that how that \ncould change everything \num it seems like code is really critical \nfor building strong language ones I mean \nwe still haven't really had \na very good thorough large empirical \nevaluation of this but it might be that \nthe reason that gpd4 is so \num good at tasks that aren't even \nprogramming like it's really good at \nsummarizing like math papers like why is \nthat happening that might be because it \nwas trained on a lot of codes codes \nmight um \nuh make models smarter we don't know yet \nbut that's a hypothesis of people are \nthrowing around I'm just \num \nI know that lots of people uh have been \nusing LMS for like you know legal stuff \npeople are trying to show that language \nmodels are really good at answering \nmedical questions \nand I think that might be a very \nbig use case in the future \nbut the current thing that I'm most \nexcited about \nis code assistance \num because I mean almost everybody that \nI know is using AI to help them program \nright now it's already made such a big \nimpact \nbut there's still \num a lot more to do there so a lot of \nthe time gpd4 will program something \nincorrect and I'll show it like you know \nthe runtime errors and I'll tell it hey \nit's not this isn't good this isn't okay \nlike and we'll be like sorry what about \nthis sorry what about this and like \nwe'll be in like this infinite Loop That \nNever Ends of just incorrect proposals \num so there's still a lot to do there \nit's not \num it's not at the place where it can \nautomatically \num \ndo things correctly we're we're far from \nthat it I give it a function description \nsometimes \nand it hallucinates things \nthat I never asked for \num \nsometimes it's trying to be \nsmart smarter than it needs to be and \nthen and ends up writing like silly code \num \nso yeah there's a lot to do there \num \nwe still have a lot of understanding uh \nthat needs to be achieved in in in \ngetting \nlanguage wants to hallucinate this to be \nmore consistent but a lot of times so in \nour paper we showed this in the self-ass \npaper we showed this silly example of \nlike you know \nGPD free with chain of thoughts saying \nsuper connectivity was discovered in \n1905 the president in 1913 was like this \nhuge inconsistency like we were asking \nabout like the president in 1905 why did \nyou go to 1913 right in a very short \ncontext it's not like it had said 1905 \nat the beginning of the page and then \nwritten like you know 17 pages and then \nit went to 1950 no it was inconsistent \nwithin like seven words \nand that was a problem with GPT through \na year ago but it's still a problem \nright now \num \nand so yeah there's still \na lot to be done there \num \nyeah but I I really like the the \nprogramming announcement hmm \nyeah I I guess kind of just sending it \nin sorry to be kind of coming back to \nthat other topic but like with the \nability of the language models to write \napis yeah it's like if as you're \nfine-tuning it for the API it loses that \nability to have like that reflection \nlike see the output see why it failed \nand then kind of revise it accordingly \nthere's all sorts of stuff going on with \nlike structured output parsing and uh \nyou know trying to enforce the output \nalmost like a compiler like to to follow \nthe grammar such that it you know you \nwould only sample tokens that follow the \nyou know the acceptable Grabber and yeah \nI think it's all just such an \ninteresting Direction writing code and \nyou know the the code interpreter I \nthink is just getting so many people's \nimaginations on what this kind of stuff \ncan do and you know I love using it to \njust like I could just you know grab a \nbunch of data and then I can ask it hey \ncould you parse this out and turn it \ninto a CSV or visualize it and I think \nall that is just incredibly powerful uh \nso one other thing is I'm talking about \nthe the potential of video transcript \ndata can you tell me a little more about \nuh how you think that's unique from the \ninternet Text data and the opportunities \nthere \num yeah so there's another rumor going \naround that openai train gpd4 on \num transcripts of YouTube videos \num \nI think there's a bunch of benefits \nthere \num that you might not have in like \nyour typical language model training \ndata \num some YouTube videos like podcasts are \nreally long and there are conversations \nabout the same topic that maybe make \nreferences to something that was said 30 \nminutes or 40 minutes ago so that's \nreally gold for language modeling for a \nlong time \n[Music] \nall the text we had was like really \nlike had short was either incredibly \nshort or was slightly longer but it \nwouldn't make like wouldn't have long \nterm dependencies and so \nas we're trying to build language models \nthat can \nhandle more complex tasks like analyzing \na large legal document or taking like \nfive code files and figuring out how to \nwrite a sixth file as we're trying to \nmake language models handle these more \ncomplex tasks we need training data the \nchallenges our models during training as \nmuch as possible and it could be \nthat long uh YouTube videos \nor long podcast uh transcripts \nare a way to get \na lot of that training data \num for cheap \num \nyeah you know that's music to my ears \nbecause my favorite like project is to \ntake these podcast transcriptions and \nlike you know build up the semantic \nsearch index with them and you know try \nit through Rag and I mean I think it's \nso interesting like if you took these \npodcasts like the Wii podcast and you \nmade that the data set you probably and \nthen you're retrieving from some other \ninformation Source you probably want to \ntag it with the date as well because \nmaybe you know some new information some \nnew perspective is discovered from later \non and if you retrieve that but yeah I \nlove it I think they're I love that \nangle of where do we find this kind of \nlong context data and yeah this whole \nconversation of fear thank you so much I \nthis coverage of Alibi attention showing \nthe demo of How It's computed and how \nthis enables extrapolation to longer \nsequence lengths I think this self-ass \nprompting thing is just so powerful I \nyou know I I think still kind of the \njury's out on how to really maximize it \nin these kind of Auto gbt this more \nautonomous kind of query decomposition \nand Tool use and then I think these \nperspectives on what we can get by more \ntraining data with code and video \ntranscripts is also exciting so fear \nthank you so much for joining thank you \nso so much Connor
