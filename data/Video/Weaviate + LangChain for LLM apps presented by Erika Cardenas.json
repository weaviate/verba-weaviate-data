{"text": "We are super excited to publish this overview of how LangChain and Weaviate work together from Erika Cardenas! Erika explains ... \nhey everyone I'm super excited to share \nthis presentation on using line chain \nand leviate to build awesome \napplications using large language models \nlet's begin with what Lang chain is just \nin case you aren't familiar \num so this quote is taken right from \ntheir documentation and it states that \nlarge language models are emerging as a \ntransformative technology enabling \ndevelopers to build applications that \nthey previously could not but using \nthese large language models in isolation \nis often not enough to create a truly \npowerful app the real power comes when \nyou are able to combine them with other \nsources of computation or knowledge and \nin this presentation we'll really see \nhow using leviate helps the large \nlanguage model the presentation goes in \nthis order so first we'll start off with \nthe llm chains and what this does is it \nenables it enables us to combine \nmultiple inferences together so this is \na step-by-step task \num so in this presentation I have an \nexample of asking the AI chat bot to use \nthe previous output as and can take that \ninto consideration for its next output \nnext I'll go over combined documents so \nwhat this is is it solves the problem of \nThe Limited token length so I will share \nfour techniques that are implemented in \nlink chain and I have a pres a \nvisualization for each next is tool use \nand this connects llams to tools that \ncan help execute it so for example \nconnecting it to webiate or a calculator \nand again I have a a quick demonstration \non that and then for chat Vector DB \num in the beginning we'll go through the \ndocumentation in line chain and then \nwe'll end with a demo on using line \nchain and mediate so make sure you stick \nto the end as you can guess from the \nname sequential chains execute their \nlinks in a sequential order so it takes \none input slash output then it uses the \noutput for the next step so let's look \nat an example of sequential chains and a \nconversation between a bot and I before \nwe get into it I want to credit the \noriginator of this example their name is \njaguely on GitHub and in the blog post I \ncredit the author so you can link right \nto the GitHub repository all right let's \nget on to the example \nall right so here I'm asking the bot \nwhat type of mammal lays the biggest \neggs \nand the response is the biggest eggs \nlaid by any mammal belong to the \nelephant and as you can see in the Emoji \nthat's a little confusing there's a \nlittle bit of hallucination going on so \nwhat I'm going to do is ask it to it's \nlike a fact Checker so I'm gonna say \nOkay given this statement how can you \nimprove your answer so let's see \num so here's a statement and it's the \nblue text that's why it is colored \ndifferently so given the above output \nmake a list of the assumptions you made \nwhen producing the above statement so \nhere it gave four assumptions that it \nused to generate the statement above so \nnow I'm going to ask okay so for the \nlist of assertions determine whether it \nis true or false \nand you can see that in the curly \nbrackets and in the color text this is \nwhat it's using all right so let's see \nwhat it says \num the first one is true so the elephant \nis a mammal mammals lay eggs is false \nand it also gave the um it also fact \nchecked itself a little bit with most \nmemos give birth to live young the third \none eggs come in different sizes it's \ntrue and then the fourth one is false \nelephants do not lay eggs so all right \ngiven that \num how would you answer the question \nwhich is which mammal like the biggest \neggs \num in here all right and then we can see \nthat it has uh this question cannot be \nanswered because elephants do not lay \neggs and most mammals give birth to live \nyoung and there you go it has it right \nand that's kind of the sequential \nchaining that I was referencing earlier \nof um it kind of fact checking itself \nall right let's go over combined \ndocuments so what this does is it \novercomes the limitation of the input \ntoken length \num so in line chain there are four \ntechniques that are implemented and I \nwill go into greater detail but at a \nhigh level I'll be going over stuffing \nmap reduce refine and map rebrink I just \nwant to make a note that there is not \none that is better than another \nperformance wise it is just based on \nyour application so make the decision as \nyou wish \nokay the first technique is stuffing and \nthis is the simplest method where you \nstuff all of the related data into the \nprompt as context and then you pass it \nto the language model next we have \nmapreduce so what this does is it \ninvolves an initial prompt um so what is \na golden doodle and it is used on each \nchunk of data so we're going to the \nvector database we're grabbing the \nrelevant documents and now we're going \nto \num we're going to add in our initial \nprompt \nall right \nso then a different prompt so here we \nhave a golden doodles and mix um we have \nthree different responses and now the \nnext prompt is to collect the answers \nand combine it into one sentence goes \ninto the large language model and boom \nwe have a golden doodle is a mix of a \ngolden retriever and poodle \nokay next is refine this one is \ninteresting because it has a local \nmemory that is used to refine the output \num so an example of this is for the \nlarge language model to summarize the \nsearch results one by one and use the \nsummer summary generated so far to \nrefine its output um so as you can see \nin the animation the green and blue \ndocument went into the large linkage \nmodel outputted the orange document and \nthen on the next round it used the \norange document and the remaining search \nresults to Output the answer of a golden \ndoodle is a mix of golden retriever and \npoodle alright so mapri rank is a method \nthat involves running an initial prompt \non each chunk of data and from here it \nwill assign a score based on the \ncertainty of its answer so here we have \nthree seven and five and now we're going \nto rank it \nand then we're going to use similar to \nthe stuffing method we're going to put \nthat into the large language model to \nOutput the \nresponse next we'll be going over tool \nuse so this is equipping language models \nwith tools like weeviate a code execute \nor even a calculator I am asking it to \nwrite python code for the bubble sort \nalgorithm \nand I'm asking it to generate code \nI'm passing it through the python repo \nwhich is a code executor that is \nimplemented in langchain and it \noutputted the response and then from \nhere I'm asking the language model is \nbased on the output is this python code \ncorrect \nand then it says yes now we'll get into \nchat Vector DB so linktrain has many \npre-built chains so we're going to go \nthrough an example of using chat Vector \nDB of it pointing to our Vector database \nand we'll take a deeper dive into how \nthis is implemented in light chain \nokay so now we're in the code base for \nthe chat Vector database we have the \nbase dot pi and prompts.pi all right \nlet's start off with prompts \nall right so the template is that given \nthe following conversation and a \nfollow-up question rephrased a follow-up \nquestion to be a standalone question all \nright so we have the chat history and \nthe follow-up input as a question and \nthe Standalone question is using the \nprompt template and then the prompt \ntemplate is using the following pieces \nof context to answer the question at the \nend \num if you don't know the answer just say \nthat you don't know don't try to make up \nan answer and this is um helping with \nthe hallucination problem all right so \nit takes in the context and it has the \nquestion and then the prompt template so \nthis will only output four search \nresults and you'll see this in the base \ndot Pi file and you'll see that right \nhere so in this \num in this file you have the two main \ncomponents of the uh using the chat \nhistory and using the query to the \nvector database now on to the fun part \nof using Lane chain and leviate together \num so on my screen you can see that this \nis where we are connecting to our revate \ninstance \num just localhost 8080 and then in \nVector store this is where you're \nspecifying which class you want Lang \nchain to see and then along with the \nclass the property \num so I'm using the podcast search demo \nthat Connor has created on GitHub \num I can add a link to it and make sure \nthat you star the repository but within \npod clip which is just the \ntranscriptions of I think almost 20 \npodcasts it has content so that's the \nconversation that Conor is having with \nwhoever he has on the podcast this is \nwhere we have the QA so the chat Vector \nDB chain from llm We're specifying the \nopenai model and then we're storing the \nchat history so just using the stuffing \nmethod that we went over previously \nit's really cool that this is so simple \nand it's what almost like 20 lines of \ncode \num just to get this started so let's get \ninto it with going into the terminal and \nasking the large language model what \nwere the features released in 117 first \nlet's make sure that we are running the \ndemo \nall right so let's ask a question what \nfeatures \nwere released \nin aviate \n117. \nall right so replication and hybrid \nsearch as well as rough to back were \nreleased in 117. though reptavec is \nspecific to Evie and that is a cool \nthing with having it the large language \nmodel connected to a vector database is \nthat it's able to grab the \num context that is relevant to your \napplication so um I guess if I ask like \na general large language model what is \nrough to back it'd be like I have no \nclue what that is but when we add in the \ncontext of the webiate podcast it \nunderstands it let's ask a follow-up \nquestion of explaining hybrid search \nwhat is hybrid search \nand there you go it's also able to \nexplain what hybrid search is and that \nit was also implemented in mediate 117. \num so it's just a quick demo and a few \nqueries of using this but you are able \nto run this on your own and I recommend \ncloning the repository of the podcast \nsearch to get started using this \nI hope you enjoyed and happy chatting \nwith your data bye \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate + LangChain for LLM apps presented by Erika Cardenas", "path": "",
