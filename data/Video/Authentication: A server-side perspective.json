{"text": "See how to configure Weaviate to allow various authentication options. Learn how to allow public access, or to set it up to require ... \nhi there in this video we'll show you \nhow to configure weeviate from a \nserver-side perspective \nyou probably know that wev8 offers \nmultiple authentication options which \nare Anonymous access API key \nauthentication and or IDC Authentication \nwe'll show you how to configure these \noptions with examples using a Docker \nbased vb8 instance note that the \nprinciples are applicable to kubernetes \nas well although the variable names \nmight be different for Helm charts \nplease also note that these are \ncurrently not applicable WCS instances \nbecause they come pre-configured let's \nget started let's start by running \nweeviate without any authentication now \nyou might remember that running waviate \nwith Docker involves setting up a \nconfiguration file like this running \nDocker compose up Dash D on the shell \nand running Docker PS we can see there's \na wave 8 instance running and notice \nthis variable in the configuration file \nas the name suggests it means that \nanyone can access this instance user GPU \nnotebook sale that I've set up for this \ndemo will instantiate a client here and \ncheck its connection and just confirm \nthat it can perform different types of \ntasks we'll read the schema and then \nwrite a new object \nand running the cell you can see it \nworks just fine now let's see what \nhappens if we switch Anonymous access \noff \nand restart waviate by running Docker \ncompose down and Docker compose up again \nand now if we run the same cell as we \ndid before \nyou'll see that it takes quite a long \ntime \nthen aviate eventually throws an \nexception \nbecause it has refused our connection \nso now let's address that by introducing \nAPI key based Authentication \nto allow users to authenticate by API \nkey we need to set up these three \nenvironment variables \nwe'll start by enabling the API key \nAuthentication \nand we'll add to a list of allowed Keys \na test key \nand we'll add me as an allowed user and \nwe'll just restart wave 8 by running the \nsame command \nand to log into wavegate we can just go \nback to our GPU notebook and add the API \nkey that we've defined as a parameter \nlike so \nand with the API key defined you see \nthat we can happily perform all three \ntasks \nnext we'll show you how to define \ndifferent levels of access for different \nusers \nto do so we need to Define authorization \nvariables which are these ones shown \nhere \nfirst we'll need to enabled admin list \nand we'll Define users who will be part \nof the admin list \nand users that will be part of the \nread-only users list \nlet's add a new user called Dave as a \nread-only user \nadd him to the list of API key users \nand the corresponding API key as well \nnow if we save those settings and \nrestart vb8 once again and go to our \nJupiter notebooks and swap out our key \nas the new key for Dave and run the cell \nyou'll notice that the first two \ncommands without any problems \nbut we couldn't run the right last \ncommand as Dave does not have sufficient \npermissions to create objects \nif we did want to give Dave full read \nand write access we can do that by \nsimply moving his name from the list of \nread-only users to the list of admin \nlist users going through the same steps \nnow all three commands run without any \nissues using Dave's API key setting up \noidc is a very similar process to \nsetting up API key access we need to set \nup these variables to match the settings \nof the token issuer \nlet's start by enabling IDC \nnow the rest of these settings will be \nunique to your token issuer \nin our case we'll use WCS as the token \nissuer and you can find those settings \nby navigating to the authentication page \nin our documentation \nnow when you scroll down you'll see our \ninstructions on how to configure \nweeviate as the resource these are the \noidc settings to be used \nso we can just start to copy these \ninside configuration file \nstarting with the oidc issuer \nthe client ID \nand the username claim \nand lastly just as we did before we'll \nprovide a specific level of permissions \nfor the user and we'll do that by adding \nmy username to the list of admin users \nlet's now restart waviate and let's see \nif those credentials allow us to access \nwaviate \nwe'll just comment out this line \nspecifying the API key \nand let's create a new variable \nspecifying the oidc credentials the \nclass to use here is the auth client \npassword class and we just need to pass \non the username and password as \nparameters like you see here I've saved \nthem as environment variables just for \nsecurity \nonce you've done that pass on the \ncredentials \nwith this parameter as we did before \nand if we run the code \nyou can see it works just fine \nspecifying on oidc credentialed user as \na read-only user is the same as before \njust get the username and instead of \nadding it to the admin list to users \njust add it to the read-only users so if \nwe run the same cell we see that just as \nit did before it runs the first two \ncommands just fine but it's not able to \ncreate an object as I don't have \nsufficient credentials \nwe hope this video gave you a good idea \nof what you need to do to set up \nauthentication and authorization for \nyour webiate instance \nthe variables set up are those that \nstart with authentication and \nauthorization like these and note that \nyou can set up a combination of API key \nbased access as well as oidc but keep in \nmind that Anonymous access will be \ndisabled once API key or oidc \nauthentication is switched on \nthanks for watching see you next time \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Authentication:
