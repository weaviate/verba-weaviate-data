{"text": "Useful links: Generative Search docs: ... \nforeign[Music]air I believe this is the fifth episodeso we are just one away from half a yearcelebration I think we should get a cakeor something next time why not thisshould be really really cool so fortodayumuh first of all I want to say toeveryone thank you for coming and andspending your time to watch and listento everything that we want to share andand thank you for being part of thiscommunity if you're watching it live orif you're watching it later on pleasegive us a like it always helps with thevideos being more reachable andaccessible and you'll come up more oftenso maybe we can get more people comingover and then watching with usparticipating asking questionsEtc and speaking of questions please askquestions as we go so I will be morethan happy to answer any reasonablequestions yeah well there's somequestions that will probably moderateout or something but in general if youask good questions we're more than happyto ask any questions you may haveso today we have few topics that wewould like to coverum I'll quickly I'd like to quicklycover the topic of meetups because westarted doing more meetups around vv8and we are visible in many differentlocations so I'd like to talk about thatlater we also kicked up Google summer ofcode campaign for this year so I'd liketo talk about this as well we will talkabout search in viviate this issomething that many of you asked us formany many times and it's workingprogress we're not there yet but we'dlike to show you what we have so far andand that will be a pretty cool topicand then also we'd like to talk to youabout a pipe API proposal this is reallycool topic of something that we are inin process of making we are not readyjust yet but you'll be really great foryou to learn all about it and then alsoshare your opinion your feedback and ofcourse I am living The Best For Last uhwe've had this huge announcementyesterday which is uh really great tosee actually we had pretty good responsefrom all over the world uh so we'd liketo talk to you about the generativemodule and how it works there will bedemos there will be conversationthere'll be questions hopefully a lot ofquestions from everyone involved in hereso these are the topics and I hope thatyou all enjoy watching it as we sharewhat we have to share sosince I I have the floor so I'm gonna dothe the annoying thing and then kind oflike continue talking to you and thenthe first thing I want to talk to you isa meetups so basicallythis month we are going to have a coupleof meetups so we'll have one Meetup inToronto and that'll be run by Zen andthen we'll have another Meetup in Bostonwhich will be run by Erica and Connorand I actually decided to jump on theplane and then come to both thosemeetups so if you anywhere near thoselocations uh definitely come and join usso just a quick reminder for Boston it'sgoing to be on February the 21stuh while the Toronto one you'll be a fewdays earlier so that's February 16th sowe're talking yeah next week Thursdayand then two weeks from now should bepretty cool and we also have meetups inother locations so if you have a curiouswhat locations uh for we have formeetups and where you can meet us andsee us then you can go to wivid IO andthen at the very bottom we have all thelocations so you can see Amsterdam NewYork San Francisco so we have links foreach of those currently we don'tnecessarily have scheduled Meetup justyet for those additional locationsalthough a little Barry is telling methat Dan is planning something for oneof the last couple of weeks of March todo in San Francisco so yeah if you're inSan Francisco or nearby then definitelycould be a cool option for you and thenI also want to do something early Marchprobably in Amsterdam so that should bepretty cool if you feel like there's alocation that we definitely not coveringwhere you feel like oh there's a few ofyou that like the meet up to happen giveus a shout there's many options maybeyou could run it and then we provide yousupport or maybe we could help organizeit ourselves uh let's see how it goesbut if you feel like there should be ameet-up I'm more than happy to hear allabout itnext topic I want to quickly cover isGoogle summer of code so I'm not sure ifany of you is new to it but the wholeidea is that Google open up this reallycool project wherevarious companies especially open sourcecompanies can join in and then proposevarious project ideas and then verystudents can apply to participate andthen the way it works is basically asthis like you could go and review someof the project ideasthat we have so you know we could maybebuild a new demo with a jupyter notebookor if you know about Django or any CMSthat could do the Vivid integration thatcould be a pretty cool topic we arelooking also for a way toImplement code examples into ourdocumentation that are interactive sobasically ones that people could go andexecute in the browser but also makechanges to them and then ideally itwould be great to have them you know inPython in JavaScript but also like goand and Java that would be pretty coolum we also would like to see like a animportant tool so it's something that JPshowed a few months ago that we had aproof of concept we just didn't get tobuilding it just yet but if you'd liketo be part of this that would be reallycool andmaybe you could help us build a new vb8module there is all sort of differentideas and and options like maybe therecould be another like uh image to vecttype a module using Ray uh why not thatwould be pretty coolum we also looking to make someimprovements to the Vivid client so ifyou are interested in helping us makeour either python Java Juice or go theydon't have to be all of them uh clientsthen give us a shout and perhaps thiscould be a great project forcollaboration and if you have cool ideasthat I didn't cover right here there isalso an option for like go and proposeyour own idea right and then in order toapply and here's how it works usually uhthe first step is you go and apply for aprojectand we have two places where you have toapply for one there's this Google formthat we've created so in here you can goand then provide like your details yourlevel of Education where you base andthen the next page is basically you saywhich project you want to participate inand then provide a bit of background asto why you think you'll be the bestperson for it and then also separatelyyou need to go and then submit todirectly to the gsoc page so kind ofhave to do it in two places and thenbased on that once we have thoseprojects approved we can then work overthe summer so usually projects kick inlike mid-june and then they run throughJuly and August project should becomplete and everybody will be happy soyeah I share we've shared the links tothe gsoc page so if you go to vividioGoogle summer slash G sub 23 the link isin the the YouTube channel so you canfind it there and same thing for for themeetups we've shared the links as wellso yeah this is basically theannouncement iHeart andumErica you firstyou suck separate from an internship Iguess if someone has a question oninternships that we makeyeah it's yeah exactly it's not so it'snot exactly an internship but it's verysimilar if you think of it so it'ssomething that is organized by Google orby the Google summer of code program wealso last year did Google summer of docswhich is why we have docusarus today forfor our website but so it's notofficially like an internship internshipbut it's very similar it's like we couldargue over semantics right like maybeyou know semantic says will probablymatch them both but they're not exactlythe sameum but it's definitely like yeah it'slike a single Project based uhyeah single product based activity andthe way we did it last year as well andit would work the same way this year forevery project there will be a mentor ora couple of mentors attached and thenusually if let's say you Connery werelike one of the students or you workright like each of you would meet withlike a mentor for your project for onehour a week and then you would be a likeyou know discussing what needs to bedone what are the next steps uh maybereview the code or maybe review theideas and then it kind of like goes onand on until the project is complete orRuns Out of Timeand that's kind of the idea yeahyeah I was just gonna add there's apotential to do really impactful work uhSebastian was telling me that some ofthe modules that we use and thecustomers use were actually initiallyinitiated by uh g-soc students rightwhich modules were those of us yeah soand oh my God I think thethe open AI module that we have uh itactually was built by by student andthere was a second one and I'm justgoing blank but yeah two two of themodules that we have in Vivid werecreated by a student so theycollaborated with Martinum yeah our senior engineer and that waspretty awesome and also if you look atthe Vivid examples so some of the Vividexamples in there were created by uh bya gsoc student so definitely there's abig big impact and and here's the thingum the theimpact it that the project may havedepends on the quality of the outputright if at the end of let's say thatimport tool is at the stage of like thisis a pretty solid uh proof of conceptbut it needs more work then that's whatit will be right it will be it could bebecome a basis for the next level of theproject well if it's something that'slike actually this is a fully blownfully tested everything like an importtoolum that should be ready like we'llprobably just like uh say hey this isthe author uh and then everyone can useit and launch it right so definitelythere's a lot of opportunity for animpactful workand also it's a it's a cool way toum raise your profile so if you'relooking for a job after that and they'relike okay so what you've done you couldshow like some University projects maybeor you could go like I feel this youknow thousands of people from theviviate uh Community or tens ofthousands are using it on a daily basisyou go like oh that's pretty coolrightso yeahany more questionsno not on mine all right so I think nextwe should talk about search in widgetand I know Dan you want it to reallyshare with everyone uh what's what'sbeen happening in that space in thatspace yes hi everyone my name is Dantuscalesco and I'm a developer advocatefor bb8 on the US West Coast and this ismy first time on we be there so thankyou Sebastian hey welcome welcome it'sgreat to have you here what I would liketo share on my screen is this um newsearch feature that we are working on sothis is the graphql console for it wedon't have a UI yet and this is how youcan run queries so for example if youwant to learn how to import data you runa query like thisand it gives you the content of thataugmentation page and its URLso let's try a different query forexample you want to know how tosearch byconceptand I made some purpose there becauseum our research polarized that and itreturns this content page with a neartext filter and again a blog post thatexplains how to use it so this is goingto be released at some point in thefuture it's going to have a convenientsearch interfaceand we're looking forward to get yourfeedback on thisthat's so cool but what's that Meme Iput a search in your search so you couldsearch while you search I justI'm a big fan of the movie Inception andthis is something like thatso I'm curious about how how is gettingthe data like uh is it like a like a webscraper where you get the mark down andchunk it up like what went into thatum we'll actually grab the HTML that'sgenerated so this might not be optimalright nowand the rows are not quite correct atthe moment but it's all work in progressand um yeah we essentially feed the HTMLPages import themas data objects very simple schema andthenthere's a search that runs against thecontentsuper coolyeah and I think this is still a littlebit of work in progress in general buthopefully we'll be able to add thatofficially to to our Vivid search pageit's a sore topic so I'm excited to seethe work on itso it's umsomething that we must have on thedocumentationyeah and I mean a big part of like whywe haven't done it beforeum it's also it's notthe challenge is not how easy it is toimplement with it with that search Ithink that the challenge that we lookedat was that we would be judged based onthe quality of results even though thatnecessarily with it as we did as such weare not responsible for creating uhthose vectorizer modules right we arethe ones that we that that use thoseright to to provide the results so iffor some reason the module that we usedoesn't help you answer exactly thequestionwe still would be judged on that whetherit's uh our responsibility to make thatmodel respond to those questions or notthat's right so we need to increase ourconfidence scores here and perhaps I'lltrain on our specific document domainyeah yeahyeah I think maybe to preview what we'retalking about later I think when you addthe generate to this and it's retrievingfrom the documentation you say likeplease write me the code for the new uhsay when we add audio to VEC pleasewrite me the audiovec code and it couldgenerate The Code by retrieving fromthis information Source just crazyyeah that'll be chargpt in your browserI mean yeah that that would be prettyeasy to add right so um and then aswe'll probably talk about it towards theend of the sessionum changing that will be just prettystraightforward thingso pretty cool so unless we have anyother questions we can move on toanother topic having said that to yourquestion earlier than Parker comes tothe rescue and I think it is actuallytext tobacco here and this someTransformers were the GSA contributionsso it's pretty coolum if if you haven't heard of thesummary summarization Transformerbecause I think Erica we talked justbefore this session and and you're likeoh right I wasn't aware of this this isactually a really cool module uh FYIthere's like one where you can run anyquery and then pass it to summarizer andthen it can summarize uh the content ofthat so it could be something that'slike 10 paragraphs long piece of contentand then you could summarize in like ashort paragraph or a couple of sentencesso um that's kind of cool and I see yeahyou are just searching for a summarizefilter that's pretty coolyeahall right thanks Dan for this uh demo soin the next segmentwe have who do we have who's next raiseyour handI think we have Connor talking about thepipe API right corner awesome super coollet's get into ityeah the floor is yours uh Zoom I sharemy screener yeah let's do it awesomesuper cool so I'm so excited to bepresenting this pipe API proposal sothis is something we've been working onabout oh sorryabout search pipelines so what aresearch pipelines so usually what happensis we start off with a query like uhwhat is reftubec or how do I use thesummarize filter and first we use somekind of information retrieval likeretrieval method like hybrid search oryou know near text near Vector nearobject and then what we might want toadd in the search pipeline is re-rankingwith say a cross encoder or maybe thisrecommendation cases where you havethese more particular learning to rankmodels they use these like a morecomplex feature engineering but you havesome kind of re-ranking phase and thenmaybe we hand that off to the generatemodule so what this API is about isabout letting weva users kind ofdecompose these steps for how they wantto form these search pipelines withinwebiate so here's an example of the APIproposal as it is now so at the toplevel pipe is going to be equivalent toget aggregate or explore with the keydifference being you put kind of thechain of the search filters in as theargument to pipe so you start off withthe query how do I use VBS pipe API andthen you have the this could be a queryto Dan's uh documentation search andthen you have the stages so stage one sostage one would be the name of stage oneand then it has Associated parametersand then at the end you index the classthat you want to be retrieving from sosimilar to kind of like git andaggregate how you have the class andthen the properties that you want toreturn and the underscore additional soso let's kind of Step a little more intothis one search pipeline flow ofretrieve re-rank and then generateso what you would have is you would havea query like what is reftubec and firstyou hit that with a hybrid search andthen you can also chain together thewhere filter so Parker came on the uhpodcast to talk to talk about rough theback replication and other things in the1.17 release so we have this wherespeaker equals Parker Duckworthsearching through the podcast Clips thenwhat we'll do is we'll re-rank the uhthese outputs from the hybrid searchwith say a high capacity cross encoderthat is uh it's lower but it's more likefine grained how it scores the searchresults so now once we've so we get thiskind of like coarse grain search resultfrom our retrieval method then we youknow clean it up with the re-ranking andnow our top five that we hand off to thegenerative module is like you know somereally good search results really highquality what is ref to vet content so wegive that and you know we can do saywrite a tweet and this is German thiswas an earlier iteration of the uhgenerate arguments but you get the ideaof how you pass in the different searchfiltersthen you say you want to search throughpodcast clips and you want to see thespeaker in the content but it's just arough idea so here are some of thesearch Primitives right now that are inweba that we're thinking of chainingtogetherso you have the spell check you have youknow Vector search with near Vector nearobject you have bm25 hybrid search andthen you have the symbolic filters ofwhere and then you have so right now wehave a symbolic ranking which is sort wecan also have the kind of the neuralre-rank and we're also thinking aboutsay like taking move two and taking thatkind of vector ranking out of theargument to near text and also makingthat kind of a primitive that you couldput in the pipe and then we also havesay extractive QA summarize and generateas things that you could plug into thepipe APIso now I want to talk to you aboutsomething that I think is reallyexciting and more more something that'skind of on the frontier and that's theflow of retrieve generate and then rankso the first idea behind this is sothese generative models like largelanguage models they're stochasticmodels so you every time you query itit'll give you like a slightly differentoutput because it has this Randomness toit and that's also controlled with thetemperature parameter as you look atlike the uh you know like the open AIDaVinci if you go to the playgroundstuff you see that you can slide thattemperature which is how random it'sgoing to be so what you can do is youcould sample many potential outputs fromthe generative model and then re-rankthose outputsso one example of this is by usingreward models and this is what's used insay deepmind Sparrow modelso here's an example let's say we have aa therapy app so John I can't believe itsomeone took my parking spot that Ialways use when I come here and Bob isour uh is our app like hi Bob from thefrom the other thing so Bob says wellit's not like you own the spot it'sfirst come first serve and John says butI always use that spot it's convenientand close to the entrance so now we sendthis to our language model and itgenerates several candidate things tosay back to JohnI don't have time for this just dealwith it and get over it I'm sorry thathappened to you and so on so we haveeight different potential Generationsso now what we're going to do is we'regoing to take a sentiment classifier asone example of reward model and thatsentiment classifier is going to assigna positive or negative score to each ofthese potential outputs so you see Idon't have time for this just deal withit and get over it that has a negative2.5817 scoreI'm sorry that happened to you but it'simportant to rememberso that has a high positive score of3.5607 so then what you'll do is you'llrank these outputs based on the positivescore and in the end this number seven Iunderstand how you feel but maybe youcan use this as an opportunity that'swhat ends up getting sent to the user soyou've generated all these candidatesand then you've re-ranked them with somekind of classifier and this is so thisis one way to just kind of they use thisin like sparrow and papers like thatjust to kind of like filter the qualityof it so they have all these things likeoh is it reinforcing a stereotype or youknow the harmful thing of these largelanguage models that scale plugging theminto making it like the next Google thatkind of thing but you can also use thisfor uh say say you're going to be usinga cheaper language model like you knowthe da Vinci one I think is like twocents per thousand tokens generated andI'll tell you about how much money Ispent on the demo later on but likemaybe you want to use a lower capacitymodel and you sample a ton of outputsfrom it because it's cheaper and thenyou can re-rank those outputs like thisso it's like another interesting thingof what we can kind of achieve with thepipeline so then let's talk aboutanother way of re-ranking CanadaGenerations which is personalizing themor recommending themso earlier we presented ref to VEC whichis a way of representing a user based onwhat they like with a vector so you cando this online online recommendationcaseso what we can do is we can similarlygenerate a bunch of candidates and thenwe can re-rank them to personalize theoutput to use so say we go into ourstable diffusion model and Erica comeswith some shoes that she wants and itgenerates all these shoes and then itand it learns to re-rank the candidateGenerations based on you know whichshoes Eric has been interacting withso to kind of come back to this this issort of the early thinking behind thepipe API design you know you put thesedifferent stages in like this kind ofsyntax and so we'd really appreciate itif you want to join us in thisdiscussion on GitHub so if you go togithub.comissues and this is issue 2560 so wewould really love it if you would jointhis conversation let us know what youthink about this pipe API designperfect this has been great and by theway we've included the link in thedescription of the video so don'tnecessarily type it yourself but that'sthe link definitely uh for all of you tocome in andyeah we'd love to hear your feedbackyour ideasum I I know we talked about it Connorbefore and and I really like what thatwhat you could do with pipeline but it'slike it was a bit of an eye-opener whenyou showed the example with this likesentiment uh example search likegenerate the results and then score thembased on the sentimentand in a way because there's no like oneway of doing it because you couldactually say like hey I want to uhrespond with a super polite answer or Iwant to be really nasty or you go I wantto find a happy medium I don't want tobe overly polite but they want to berude either so that that gives power toyou like when you write a query to tomake it exactly how it should be it'sit's pretty awesome and and I like howthere's so many possibilities rightbecause you could check it for like isdoes this use inclusive language or itcould it be you know culturallyinappropriate etc etc and and I knoweven like there's some startupsthat help rewrite job descriptions sothat they are more inclusive becausethere's like for example certainlanguage that is very helpful for peoplelike me middle-aged white guy right buteverybody else feels like oh I don'tlike this content so I think this kindof use cases could be achieved with thispipeline it's like it's amazing so Ilike it I like it a lotif my therapist outfitted that firstresponse I would fire it I guess itbecause I don't know gender but um alsowhere would you include the positivesentiment I guess if you can go back tothe oh okay so I meant to uh so in thiskind of part I'm more so saying likeokay here's what we can here's what wecan do with pipe sort of As We Lay thefoundation from it I think sort of thisis the thing I would recommend lookingat first this is sort of the next stepfor pipe because um when you're going tobe doing generations with the da Vincimodel you're going to be spending a bitof money on the on the generation so itmakes a lot of sense to me that youwould want to re-rank your searchresults so the trade-off with re-rankingis that it's a little slower it's alsomaybe a little harder to maintainbecause now you have another containerwith the with another Transformer in itthat's going to be scoring the querydocuments and giving that high capacityscore but this I think is like the nextstep of massively added value and thenwith this I with um sorry with this ideaof the reward model ranking I think wecould introduce something like a youknow classifiers as another we V8 moduleis you know maybe that's another moduleto build for the Google summer of codeyeah hey yeah yeah that's cool that itwould be implemented and we need soinstead of having to Define it yourselfbe like positive class negative I don'tknow who would want to use the negativebutwell it depends you may want to justlike put a lot of pressure on somebodyright just like uhlike in negotiations when you want to bereally tough you shouldn't need to benice rightoh we should have like an alpha scorelike we have for hybrid it's likepositive negative like right in themiddlethere we gomodul API is being designedyeah that's lovely it's lovely is therelike any time frame of like for by whenwe want to hear hear this feedback orwhat's what's there could we have adiscussion maybe on slack or should wejust all focus on this GitHub issuewhat's what's your preference I thinkthe GitHub issue is a great place todiscuss if you go there now you'll seeuh edians left some initial comments andso like if if you sort of look at whatEd Ian's done that's sort of the perfectexample of I guess how these GitHubissue conversations happen edians likethe the master of the repository I'd sayand it's still something new for me tobe learning honestly this open sourcethe way that the issues are open is justreally fascinating I'd recommendchecking this out even if just it's tosee what these kind of Open Sourceissues look like foreignit's pretty amazingcool cool let me check because theremight be some uhquestions some questions about theGoogle summer of code in the chatyeah so I I could probablydo that so like suppose I'm intointerested in a particular project fromthe gsoc list what should be the nextsteps so NG edits so Angie I think thatthe best step would be you could sofirst of all join this slack Communityfor for wibit which I'm pretty sure youalready are part of and then in there wehave a g-soc channelum if if you have an idea on working onsome of those projects you can ping usthere like Drop say like hey I'minterested in this project what whatshould we next is we could maybe have aconversations if you already have anidea of how would you want to approachit or if you could come up like hey if Ihad three months I would do this infirst Monday second this third or somesort of anything to kind of like justget going and that'll be probably a goodthing and and honestly like this step isjust go and then applyuh to uh through the two links that Ishared earlier so you'll be pretty goodlike thatand on a different font of like talkingabout uh get up and at the end you knowI think it's like if you see say hisname three times you actuallyso like I think here he is so we have atthe end I was like yeah definitely likethis is something that we truly believein right like we are not a GitHub we arenot an open source company just formarketing like or this is not amarketing strategy it's literally how wewant to run our business how we want tocommunicate because this is the best wayfor for all of us to do the best and andI always like kind of like use thisexampleit and that's part of like diversity youknow the power of diversity and power oflike having all these opinions if youhave like five people coming fromHarvard and you give them a toughproblem they will give you a really goodsolution right but if you take peoplefrom like five different completelydifferent places they'll give you fivedifferent solutions and quite possibly acouple of them will be better than thethat single one from Harvard right sothat diversity of ideas and things thatyou may see or may have missedum yeah it's just so important to toalways appreciateso yeah that's just my little few centscool so I don't see any more questionsfor now I hope uh everyone is enjoyingit and by the way like for those thatyou listen like drop us a message fromof like where you uh listening from andthen just just say hi in general likethat that's enough not all interactionshave to be questions so uh and if yousay something nice I'll show you as wellon the on the screen as a banner so whynotcool so like I said we're leaving thefinal topic uh the best topic for thelast so that's not to say that the othertopics were important but I think we aresuper excited about the genitive searchuh project oh well there will be a demoso I think I would pass the floor tomaybe then then you have like someopening ideas and you want to discussyeah we can talk aboutwell first we'll talk about whatgenerative search is a little bit lateron but I wanted to talk aboutgpt3 what chat GPT is and what are someof the shortcomings of chat GPTum I don't have to tell you what chatgbt is it's the fastest growing appservice it was the it reached 100million uh daily active users I think itwas a monthly or daily I can't remembernow but in two months the next closestis Tick Tock which got there in Ibelieve nine monthsum so everybody knows what chat GPT isbut uh one of the things that is superinteresting that's coming up on Twittereven before while we were working onthis module in the backgroundI was looking over Twitter and peoplewere like oh this would be cool if wecould have a personalized version ofthis right what if we could have uh ourinternal uh organization docs trained onchat EBT so that it could become aautomated uh HR chat bot or an automatedum I don't know like a customer servicechat bot where it knows what products Ihave on my Ecommerce store which onesare on sale which ones are on clearanceand it could answer all of thesequestionsum not just in a robotic way butkind of taking your own data and thenhaving it uhhaving the power of the generativemodule of chat GPT right getting it tocreatively answer and realisticallyanswer questions with your own dataand so that that really is the utilityof the uh generative open AI module thatwe announced this week yesterday in factand so the main idea is the power ofchat GPT the creativity of chat CPTeverything we like about chat gbt butcustomize to your own data and theapplications are really Limitlessum so we wanted to talk about that alittle bit there are some questions thatI had and instead of getting on a callwith Connor one-on-one and kind ofuh talking about and expanding myunderstanding I thought that we couldtake advantage of my ignorance and forfor the benefit of the wider audience wecould ask those questions here but umConnor if you'd like to add in detailsto thatyeah I think coming off of what you justsaid I what I love about this idea ofhow we v8's integrated chat GBC is so Iused to think that you were going toneed to fine-tune the language model onyour data so you know you'd have to havethis 175 billion parameter model andthere are these advances in like sparsefine-tuning that meant that you know itwas getting more cost effectivebut still I mean you have to do somegradient descent optimization on yourdata and that to me seemed reallyambitious but now what we have is thisGeneral reasoning ability that can youjust provide the data with search andthen it can reason across the searchresults and it and it has this likelocal memory kind of thing that you cando where you you can prompt it to likekind of store intermediate uh outputs toovercome that 4096 uh context length andthat I think is just so powerful thatkind of local memory in in addition tothe external memory I think that youdon't need to fine-tune the languagemodel and that I think is the big I Ihonestly am so surprised that this thatit ended up working out like thisyeah I thought I thought we would haveto do something similar and I think I Iwas talking I was looking at this umpress release from Microsoft actuallyyesterday and they might eventually godown that route for like an Enterpriseversion of chat CBT where you have theability to fine tune but if you use thenew module that we released the resultswith just providing context and thengrounding your prompt or task in thatcontext are pretty fascinating it getspretty much the entire job doneyeah it's really interesting maybe Ericayou could talk about your earlyexperience with just Chad gbt firstthoughts on it andoh yeah I think the main point I wantedto cover was extractive versusgenerativeum question answering so chatbots aren'tnew but what is near aesthetic you'reable to give it like this open-endedprompt um so like you said you're ableto ground the question in the contentthat you just gave it and I'm going toshow a demo and give an example on thisbut I mean it's just fascinating likeinstead of just like a quick shortanswer of just extracting it from theparagraph that you gave at that it canlike generate a paragraph a tweet aFacebook ad it's like fascinating thatit even knows what a tweet is and it'spretty accurateum which is really cool so that's justone thing I want to cover but also likejust for like an HR or chatbot like thatkind of the ability for it to extractinformation and then summarize all of itis really coolis that what generative searches this isone of the questions I had what's thedifference between generative search andsearch so I know in searchyou can ask a question and then it'llgive you like 100 pages of resourcesthat you'll have to peruse through toget the answer right what is generativesearchyeah well if I'll take I'll start thisoff and then and think about like umyeah like I take it as I thinkgenerative search started as an academicterm to refer to you would have thelanguage models just general like samewith the stochastic sampling that youre-rank with the therapy app you'd usethe language models to generatecandidate answers and that would be likeyour search is like you get theinformation from the language model butI think now what the term is evolving tomean is just like that generative layerat the end of search so you search andthen you give it to the generative modelthat's how I'm thinking that that termis going to evolveit yeah so I feel it's it's an evolvingterm at this point there was a a pressconference from the CEO of Microsoftyesterday that I was watching and he Ithink he shared a similar concept hedidn't call it genitive search he calledit AI backed search and the and thewhole point there is instead of givingyou the 10 most relevant links it'llgive those 10 most relevant links to theuh the large language model and thelarge language model interprets andproduces a relevant answer regardingthat content and then it cites those uhsources in the in the at the bottomthere right which is pretty interestingbecause now you canwith search but before search we had togo through and look through lots andlots of resources this is relevant thisis not relevant the initial concept ofsearch made that easy now feeding thatinto AI makes the next part of our jobeasier so he was saying howit's not that it's going to do your jobfor you it's just going to take theresults and interpret them and give youa potential first draft that you canthen improve on you accept this don'taccept this which is pretty interestingthere's also a bit of philosophicaldebates when it comes toum image search for example generativesearch for Samurai sub gate Golden GateBridge during fog in the spring at 8amthere probably is a picture of that butthatly could also generate one thatwould be near indistinguishable fromreality so as a user does it matter toget a real picture or generate one atsome point you won't be able to tell thedifferenceyeah and I know that both Google andMicrosoft are are working on stuff likethis where if you're searching forimages they're not just going to bringyou images that are sourced fromsomewhere on the web now if they thinkthat they can create a better image froma model like dally or the open sourceversion of uh similar to that stablediffusion you'll actually be able to seefake and real images which is prettyinteresting and the same thing couldhappen for music audio Google just cameout with this model called music LM youcan describe what type of music what youwant to generate and it'll create like30 second five minute clips of it foryou and so it's not justquestion answering text to text or textto image it's all sorts of modalitiesthat are coming up now it's so excitingto be in the spaceyeah I think as a user if you ever giveme like a response that is likeautomated generated that is not like abite person or something I would alwayswant to have a flag something that letsme know this was generated because uhbecause I think there's a an element oftrust when I get something this is realversus generated and and I actually inthe past wrote an article aboutwhether chatbot should pretend to bepeople or whether you should always beaware because in my opinion if you evertalk to a chatbot and then you find outlike six comments later that this wasn'ta real person while you were like superpolite and everythingum and by the way you should always bepolite even to chatbotsum like you you would feel like younever know right but you you you youwould feel cheated right you would golike oh I built this trust build thisrelationship I ex like spend this energyand then it's like it's just a machineright like it's like what the hell so Ithink I'd want to know the truth youknow like if I'm in The Matrix tell meyeahsorry really quickum when using Chachi BTO we start withplease I don't know why but when I hadto start paying for it I was like ah letme excuse like a minute please because Idon't want it to use that as a token nowthat it's your serviceso so you know this technique like whenyou're dating somebody for the firsttime you know what kind of people theyare based on how they talk to their chatBots rightto Tinder and then it gives you apersonality scoreyeah well I wanted to actually relaythis back to Eric anyways because whatSebastian was saying about truthfulnessand I know Erica has built this demothat she's going to show us soon aboutwhere you you know there's like thiskind of SEO content where you know yougenerate it to hit the keywords so whatdo you think like should websites thatdo this like kind of just like bruteforce a ton of const content that comesout of language models what do you thinkis the future of thatI think having the source is extremelyimportant like Sebastian said likebuilding that trust but also knowingwhere it comes fromum I had asked chat to BT a fewquestions and I was like huh like isthis taking is the content that it'sgiven me from Wikipedia is it fromsomeone's personal blog post like can Iuse this can I relay itum so I think like a track of thesesources is very importantum yeah whether it's generated or real Idon't think that matters as long as thesource is there and it's clear with thatthe other thing that's super cool tothink about that is if you're takingChachi BT and not just asking a generalknowledge questions or publiclyavailable questions that can be answeredwith public publicly availableinformation but moreproprietary information you don't reallywant it to hallucinate details like if Iask a HR chat bot when's the nextcompany social or when the next holidayis or something like that I don't wantit to give me a fake answer that'sthat's stochastically optimized on onpreviously pre on my training set Iwanted to give me real facts right itcan flourish it by telling me Oh youmight want to book like a flight orsomething two days in advance for thisbut I don't want it to give me fakeinformationum how do you limithallucination in a in a like acustomizer private application of chatGPT can you limit it orsounds scaryyeah it's a really great question wellit kind of comes back to when Ericabrought up the extractive QA versusgenerative models as well like I thinkthe extractive classified the answer inthe context I think that still has a tonof value especially because it's I meanit's way cheaper it's super fast like ifyou're putting this into your website doyou want to pay however many I mean likeI don't know like you'd have to do themath of like how many viewers you haveany questions right but like theextractive QA model where it'sclassifying the answer in the context Ithink that will still have a lot ofvaluealso with the temperature like with theQ a opening how we have that it's likereducing the randomness I think isimportant but also still generating thelike of balancelike yeah just setting temperature tozero and yeahso can you explain what happens if youset temperature to zero it takes away ittakes away the stochasticity completelyorthat's a good question I don't know ifit takes it away completely but yeahthat's the scale more deterministictowards zero ah okayrightyeah I did test it out and I hadtemperatures set um really high I don'tknow I didn't check it and it um I thinkmy question was on what is Rapture factand it outputted a Labrador Retriever aspopular in America I was like I didn'teven mention a dog like what's happeningkeep that one internal so it wasconfidenthey don't don't you know why they arerelated come on it's so obvious maybe itknows something I don't I guess I don'tknow maybe they're both superenthusiastic and full of energy andcan't help themselves when there's foodaroundI know Sebastian was touching on this aswell buthow much would it cost let's say Iwanted to just try this out as a hobbyuh this module that we released how muchwould it cost meumyeah so right now you're paying abouttwo cents per thousand tokens generatedand when I do my demo I'm going to startoff by let's go into the playgroundlet's see how much how many tokens we'relooking at realistically but um yeah Imean My Demo cost me fifteen dollarsso yeah you have like a 15 certificatelike I know my stuff you know I'veinvested time sweat and money fifteendollars at two cents per thousandprompts that's a lot of problemsyeah I think you're being charged forthe prompt too whatI suppose it makes sense maybe the likethe way that they batch the inputs orsomething like that I'm really not surebut yeah that's interestingwould it be a good time to actually thenjump into like the the withinintegration because I know we have acouple of demos and then because then wecould also use it as a context maybe andthat could be relevant like all thetemperature and kind of resultsum because I know Erica you have demoright should I share your screen becauseI think that'll be pretty cool like thisis super cool stuff right like I'm gonnago quiet nowfloor is yoursso I'll start with the docker file um soI we you have to use the latest versionof bb8 which is 117.3 or a newer versionum you can also run this in WCS I meanyou can use the free sandbox for 30 daysum it is already implemented in WCS youcan do that as well um but for this demoI'm using I'm running it locallyum so one thing to note is in the enablemodules you have to use the generativeopenai and you have to include this withthe vectorizer that you are using inthis demo I'm using text spec openaiSebastian has other ideas but you canalso use anyvectorizer cohere hiding face and theother one Sebastianyeah pretty much any any vectorizer thatthat you have that we have you could useit with with open AI uh with this likethe generative open AI because this isthe really cool thingum the generative uh module is not usedfor a query right so like you search foruh for your results and then once youhave the results you pass it on to thethe genjive module and go like hey I gotthis result what can you do about it sotechnically you could actually just do ascalar search without any vectors stillretrieve results like you could say likegive me the results where title equalsthis or like this that's not a vectorsearch and yet you could retrieve someresults and opacity to a generativemodule to kind of go like now create aresponse for it right so that's that'swhat I'm kind of saying like as much asyour demo Erica uses to open AI basedmodules they could you could useanything so the kind of stuff that ifyou're already building with V8um you can just that at General open eyeto it and then boom you have an extraoptionpossibilities are unlessright now so many so many possibilitiesand then this is where you will add youropenai key I've hidden my secret key soI don't get charged a lot of moneyum but you can also import at importtime as an import query timeum instead of in the docker file um soit is up to youall right I will show my data um so I'musing the podcast on uh from ConnorParker and edian on the 117 releaseum so you can see we have three propertyproperties we have speaker content andthen the podcast numberum Conor has a GitHub repository on um Ithink you have like 15 maybe alreadycomplete yeah 15 out of the 35 but I'llget it doneand I guess I could omit pod numberbecause it is only I'm only using the 31but just so you know if you clone therepository uh this will change all rightnow I'm going to go over to my schemaum so this is standard the real the coolpart about the generative module isthere really is nothing different aboutitum for the schema so just like to haveany instance running with me that youneed to have a schemaum so here I'm just pointing out that Ihave my class the Pod clip which ispodcast and then just my threeproperties which is content speaker podnumber and I'm using the text to backopen AI moduleall right and then uploading is standardit's what we've all seen and if youaren't familiar with it if you have agreat quick start tutorial end to end iswhat I think it's called and you canreference that it's extremely helpfuland Sebastian and JP have worked veryhard on it all right and now on to thefun part of the consoleall right so here we have the query sowe have pod clip and I'm using hybridsearchum so my query is what is rectifac andI'm setting my output as 0.5 so it'sdoing the mixture of hybrid oh sorry ofdense and sparse a search and I'mlimiting it to oneum just because that's all that isneeded and I'm output I'm retrieving thecontent from that which again is wherethey're speaking about reftubecum and by they I mean it's either Connorpark or onion and then uh this is thenew part is additional so have generatesingle result and I'm giving it a promptso my question is what is reftubec andI'm asking it oh no I didn't includesplease see I wasn't lyingum answer the question based on thecontent that is given from up here youdon't have to be polite and then I'mjust going to Output the single resultand I included the question what isreftubec because I found that it alwaysincluded it and the the generativemodule always had a question so I justthought it'd be easier to Define it hereand then just the answerum so you can see uh that it answerswhat brought to back centroid isETC but the really cool part is that itis condensing this content bit into likea few sentencesany questions anything small Pointanything outyeah so that umparameter that you have like thatcontent thingwhat what is that doing exactlyso that's a good note content is just aproperty of pod clip so I don't wantpeople to think that content isum like you have in your data you haveto have content it could beum like ratings or that's about it orreview I guess so if if I had a propertyreview this is where I would replace ithere and then also here so that issomething to keep in mindmaybe we could try adding speaker abovecontentand then in the prompt uh please answerwhat speaker setup said about contentwould that be fun for everyoneyou you can do thatspeakeryeah so maybe yeahuh please answer whatare you speaker oh yeah in the curlybrackets or maybe instead of thejust was so then it would be like pleaseanswer what Parker Duckworth said aboutcontentI said you could embed the speakerproperty can you yeah so so it's puttingin the speaker result into that prompttemplatewill there be a should I ohlet's run it enter what uh actually yeahyeah cool see what happens let's seeohthis is going to be cooloh Parker was speaking about it butyeah yeahmaybe like please include somethingabout who said it yeah I think that Ithink you've done a great job of justshowing that you can do the twopropertiesyeahyeahthat's a cool ideamaybe I'll get it to work while we talkabout something elseor not yeah I think it already worksall right so this is uh so in thegenerate module we have added singleresult but we also have grouped resultand what this is doing is well what ishappening there we goum we have added group result um soinstead of a prompt it is being assigneda taskum so here I'm also I want I'm usingVector search sorry about that to get toreturn where they are speaking abouthybrid searchand I'm setting my certainty to 0.75just so it's um as accurate as possiblerightum I'm limiting it to threelet's seeI think this would be in the historyI just wannalet me just showhold on sorryon the Fly I guess maybe one extra curlybracketall right so here's the content whereum speakersorryall right so here's the content whereConnor is speaking about hybrid searchthen we also have Parker this is hitwhere he's speaking about it and thenalso edianright so if I add in the uh generate thegroup result it's going to considerthese three resultsoh no here we goand it's being tasked with combining theresults which are which are the threethat I just showed and um condensing itinto one paragraphon explaining what hybrid search is ohnooh wait I know that worked all right sohere we have hybrid search is acombination of keyword scoring and suchas tfid yet it does a great job howamazing is that and again it's just umoutputting content because that is whatis in my schema and not because you haveto use content but yeah and that'sSeptemberhey this is pretty coolI had a question about this limit whatifso from what I understand we're using weV8 to filter the context and thenprovide the prompt and the context tothe open AI APIum is there a limit to how much contextwe could provideyes I think Connor had some troubleum like if it is too long I think openAI times up I believe yeah I have alittle recommendation for that on thefly if you under if you go to error soByron added error above group drizzleand maybe let's go ahead and put limitto 30 to break it on purposehere yeah nailed it 30.yeah so if you so it'll tell you youknow hey you try to give it uh in thiscase okay yeahalso I feel like if you're kick reportlet me just limit it to three it alsokind ofit doesn't help so why not limit onelimit three I think in the first one Ihad limit one yeahI'm just hereyeah I think it's really cool like um ifI can add on this limit thing well thiswhole kind of like so we've yet toimplement it with asynchronous calls sothe open AI so like if you want to do uhsummarize all the podcast Clips then youit can do it will do all those calls forall the podcast Clips like in paralleland I thought that was really nice likeI was previously I was looping throughit in Python and you know I'd be sittingthere for like five minutes waiting forall the calls to get backI mean that's the part of the beauty ofdeveloper experience in viviate rightlike it's all about making making yourjob a lot easier than uh it needs to berightum I think there's one thing Erica inthe first demo for the single searchright or single result because at themoment you're limited to one but um ifthe limit was five then basically whatwe would do is run the query and thenfor each response you'll get onegenerated answer right so definitelydon't necessarily run it on like if youhave 10 000 objects on like all tenthousand because there'll be a lot oftokensum so it's good definitely to to limitand now we because yeah this willperform five parallel uh requests butyou don't need to worry about like doingit one by one just like Corner setso um this is cool because so now weshould get five answers rightokay let's check it outlook at it goso if we had type uh operator now thenwe could take these answers and thenmaybe do some sort of analysis of eachanswer and then rescore that and reorderor like just provide like the bestanswer rightyeah yeah amazing yeah because he waslike are you still talking about reftubeor are you talking about uh Labradorsyou know likeright like maybe there could be like afield uh some sort of modular can gendouble check if this is a true answer orif it's a hallucinated nonsense or staryeah brilliant and it lives in weavia sonicely I think the yeahyeah amazing very nicewell done cool demo Erica yeah awesomejob here Christthank yousoum what should we cover next Conor didyou also have a demo that you wanted toshow or yeah my demo will be quick itbuilds on Erica's demo using the samedata set and the same idea and yeah if Icould share my screen um so yeah there'sone there's one kind of one more thing Iwant to add to this which is umthat was my screenshot all right sofirst let's let's go into the open AIplayground and let's see how much 4096tokens isall right so if everyone sees my screenhere uh this is the playground for openAI so so this is a segment uh from thisis the uh transcript of Bob's demo onour new podcast announcing the generatemodule so this is 622 tokens this blobof tech so let's you know just keepgoingwhat's a token is is a water token orwhat makes a token awesome question soso token is you is like it's like a partof a word so it usually be like threecharacters together so so you thetokenizers they look at the statisticsof the commonly co-occurring charactersand then they try to compress the groupsof characters so you have like wordpiecetokenizers by pair encoding they're likeall these different techniques but uhyeah I I think with the new era you canjust drop it into open Ai and see howyour tokenized account but I'd alsorecommend if you are curious about thisof seeing um you know hugging face hasthe auto tokenizers Library so if youwant to play around a tokenizers that'sa great resource for it okay so so nothat's a quick question on that yeah umso what about stemming and stop or doyou think that could improveor search results arethat's an interesting question with withlike how you would remove stop words forhandoffs to the generate module I thinkit's probably best not to do thatbecause it probably uses all theselittle language Clues so like stop wordswould remove uh like the and yeah thingslike that and I think those littlelanguage Clues do help a lot that's thekind of like the templating thing withthe speaker said content on date thoselittle words in there that you actuallylike help it a little bitOkay cool so so this is 4 400 tokens soif we just kind ofyou know it's it's a good bit of textthat chat gbt these gbt models can takein so you know one two three four youknow it can take in you know roughlyseven of Bob's demo transcripts nothat's like the most hand wavymeasurement ever but like just to get asense of how much you can take in so soit's it's pretty good at taking in youknow it can take in pretty long contextbut you know you can't put an entirecode base in there you can't put anentire book in there right so you westill need these clever strategies andand that's the reason why I think we'veyet is just so exciting and like thispositioning of the language model andthe vector databases is so excitingbecause chat gbt offers this reasoningbut then it needs help with the memorybecause you know set six paragraphs orso it's it's like a lot but it's notlike unlimited right so there are twothings that I want to talk about and thefirst of which is breaking down a taskinto subtasksand the other of which is top levelindexing so then and then first I wantto thank our friends at langchain andgbt index uh Harrison and Jerry boththey're both going to be on the podcastwe've been publishing those podcastssoon and they've done incredible work onpioneering the tools in this kind ofspace of decomposing tasks into chainsof language model calls and also the toplevel index Constructionso let's talk about how we're going tobreak down the task I'm sorry this is Iwas like rushing to get this done beforeso I hope this like it's not as neat asErica's with the docker file and allthat but you'll see the idea hey thehistory is happening live here in youknow here live you know that's importantyeah I'm still finishing it now but theumokay so we're going to Loop through eachof the podcast clips and the prompt isgoing to be please write a summary ofthis podcast clip so that that is storedand so here's the next thing we canwrite data back to eviate from thelanguage model so the language model isgoing to generate a short summary andit's going to write that in weviate sonow you have pod clip has short summaryshort summary a new Eva class and so sothen we're going to aggregate the shortsummaries into a group summary so so youknow this again so we're trying to getaway from that 4096 token length if Itake all these short summaries and justtry to put them into GPT and saysummarize this it goes error this you'vetried to give me like 12 000 tokens sowe group them into group summaries andthen we're going to summarize the wholepodcast with the summary of the groupsummaries and then what we can do sothis last thing is What's called the toplevel index so now we can search throughthe summaries so so let's say I want tosay uh you know what's the most similarpodcast to podcast number 35 you knowgenerative search with leviate I nowhave a Vector representation of thesepodcasts which are these like wildlycomplex objects so you know say you havescientific paper and it has passage haspassage like now you have a top levelindex you have some Vectorrepresentation of the whole paper and sowith ref to VEC we were looking at youaverage the embeddings of these passagesbut now we have this new controller withthe ability of the large language modelto summarize that gives us another wayof forming that Vector representation atthe top level soso I mean My Demo isn't uh superorganized but oh sorry so you can justsee the uh on the uh so you can see theuh the summary so so in the end allpause summary oh yeah oh no oh yeahall right so in the end you can see theuh so the All pod summary so if we wantto sayuh so let's say we take this is thepodcast with or let me say so this is apodcast with Bobso the most recent one that just cameout uh sorryah well let me copy and paste thisall right let's do that muchso if we just add herea near textand Conceptsthis one nopesorry about thatwait soanyway so that kind of idea ofoh sorry about thatokay let me just start eating let mejust say good all-pod summaryuh let's donew attackssorry everyone for the delay on this allrightlet's just say concepts we're goingthat's part of live coding right like umsometimes you may say character it'shard to findOkay cool so okay so what we have hereis the so it's searching through thesummaries of all the podcastsso we say you know it's saying uh thepodcast with Jonathan Franco where hewas talking about uh Mosaic ML and wedid also talk about uh the self-askprompting and all that so so you can seehow you like now you have this top levelindex so so this is the recent podcastof Bob and this is the podcast with uhBob Chris and Marco where we talkedabout uh facts and how they're usinglarge language models in search so soyeah so you have this top level indexthat comes from breaking up the taskinto first summarize the podcast Clipsuh then summarize the umyou know the summaries and then form theoverall summary so it's how youdecompose the language model calls andand achieve the memory that lets youovercome the 4096 tokenscool so that's all I gotniceso yeah coolso that's basically yeah the generatedanswers already so I guess yeah becauseif you keep uh if you already have theanswers right like you don't have toregenerate them over and over againright that's the ideayeahCoco hey I I've got a question and backto like Erica's demo originally rightum or if we were to do like um agenerative search on this could you makeit uh to respond in another languagelike say like hey given the context ofthis what is this explain in Spanish orpolish or German is that possible I didI did see Bob's demo had um write thetweet in Dutch I can't read Dutch but Itook his word for it and he says I knowDutch somaybe we'll go back from summary ofsummaries back to a summary in Dutchyou want you may want to limit it tolike two three rightin Spanishyesforeignnow who speaks Spanish hereErica speaks a little bit of Spanishoh Don you and I when we're in Italy wetried that communicating in Spanishright like maybe you can figure out theSpanish yeah but yeah result in the uhfirst returnI think it helps topick it up like thiswhy not just please summarize it inSpanish and then end with contentplease summarizethisplease write the summary oops sorryokay stopyoso you definitely passed you'redefinitely passing the the chatbotpoliteness communication test yeahit's a proof that Conor is a nice personin real life toookay I'm sorry I don't know why it'sumI think kind of the way you format itumwell I guess we'll just have to figureit out another time or something andlet's see what happenswhat if you don't do please write inSpanish like is there just the syntaxissue or yeah oh I got it working okaythat's good Erica nice message to Ericano worries that's part of like livecoding right so uh let's do itoh I think answer in Spanishcan't be translated so we have some likeMiami Spanish going onthank youtoday that is epic nice niceso impressive so impressivecool I guessumthat's most of the stuff we have tocover right for today and um any finalquestions any any takes anything fromanyonehere in the audienceyeah if you ask any question when thisis not running live I won't be able toretrospectively go into my time machineand answer it so I'm sorry for that mytime machine it's out of battery at themomentthat's cooland we promise to give you real answerswe're not going to use uh machines justyet or do we I'll do it well we promisewe won't let you we won't be caught yeahdefinitelyall right uh Team uh thanks for for thisamazing session thank you all forwatching and listening and and thenplease let us know your feedback yourideas uh just just to summarize if youwant to join any of the meetups that wehave like like I said at the beginningwe are in Amsterdam we're in New Yorkwe're in Boston we're in Toronto and SanFrancisco and specifically in the nextcouple of weeks we will be in BostonToronto so definitely join us thereum if you're a student and you want oryou want to contribute to vv8 we arekicking off Google summer of cold uh thelinks are in the description so youshould definitely do that if you'reinterested in the new pipe operator isit an operator well we can figure outthe new pipe APIum there's a GitHub issue go read andsee what others are saying providefeedback give us your ideas because wewant to work on all of it in in the openand then any feedback will make it justbetter Dan shared with you as well forhow we work on our search capabilitiesthat we will use for the documentationso that you should be able to searchthroughout docs through our blogs andthrough the podcast that Connor iscurrently transcribing so this should bepretty awesome and of course like thethe thing uh the cherry on top of thecake like with the generative modulelike we're so super proud and as youcould see it's pretty amazing and um andit works really really well well there'sa little caveat you need to get yoursyntax right and your brackets right uhbut once you have the syntax righteverything works just perfectlyum so yeah that was uh that was it'sbeen a pleasure and uh thank you all forlistening thank you team for joining andhave a great day evening morning thankseverybody thank you very much see yousoon bye bye", "type": "Video",
