{"text": "Useful links: Generative Search docs: ... \nforeign \n[Music] \nair I believe this is the fifth episode \nso we are just one away from half a year \ncelebration I think we should get a cake \nor something next time why not this \nshould be really really cool so for \ntoday \num \nuh first of all I want to say to \neveryone thank you for coming and and \nspending your time to watch and listen \nto everything that we want to share and \nand thank you for being part of this \ncommunity if you're watching it live or \nif you're watching it later on please \ngive us a like it always helps with the \nvideos being more reachable and \naccessible and you'll come up more often \nso maybe we can get more people coming \nover and then watching with us \nparticipating asking questions \nEtc and speaking of questions please ask \nquestions as we go so I will be more \nthan happy to answer any reasonable \nquestions yeah well there's some \nquestions that will probably moderate \nout or something but in general if you \nask good questions we're more than happy \nto ask any questions you may have \nso today we have few topics that we \nwould like to cover \num I'll quickly I'd like to quickly \ncover the topic of meetups because we \nstarted doing more meetups around vv8 \nand we are visible in many different \nlocations so I'd like to talk about that \nlater we also kicked up Google summer of \ncode campaign for this year so I'd like \nto talk about this as well we will talk \nabout search in viviate this is \nsomething that many of you asked us for \nmany many times and it's working \nprogress we're not there yet but we'd \nlike to show you what we have so far and \nand that will be a pretty cool topic \nand then also we'd like to talk to you \nabout a pipe API proposal this is really \ncool topic of something that we are in \nin process of making we are not ready \njust yet but you'll be really great for \nyou to learn all about it and then also \nshare your opinion your feedback and of \ncourse I am living The Best For Last uh \nwe've had this huge announcement \nyesterday which is uh really great to \nsee actually we had pretty good response \nfrom all over the world uh so we'd like \nto talk to you about the generative \nmodule and how it works there will be \ndemos there will be conversation \nthere'll be questions hopefully a lot of \nquestions from everyone involved in here \nso these are the topics and I hope that \nyou all enjoy watching it as we share \nwhat we have to share so \nsince I I have the floor so I'm gonna do \nthe the annoying thing and then kind of \nlike continue talking to you and then \nthe first thing I want to talk to you is \na meetups so basically \nthis month we are going to have a couple \nof meetups so we'll have one Meetup in \nToronto and that'll be run by Zen and \nthen we'll have another Meetup in Boston \nwhich will be run by Erica and Connor \nand I actually decided to jump on the \nplane and then come to both those \nmeetups so if you anywhere near those \nlocations uh definitely come and join us \nso just a quick reminder for Boston it's \ngoing to be on February the 21st \nuh while the Toronto one you'll be a few \ndays earlier so that's February 16th so \nwe're talking yeah next week Thursday \nand then two weeks from now should be \npretty cool and we also have meetups in \nother locations so if you have a curious \nwhat locations uh for we have for \nmeetups and where you can meet us and \nsee us then you can go to wivid IO and \nthen at the very bottom we have all the \nlocations so you can see Amsterdam New \nYork San Francisco so we have links for \neach of those currently we don't \nnecessarily have scheduled Meetup just \nyet for those additional locations \nalthough a little Barry is telling me \nthat Dan is planning something for one \nof the last couple of weeks of March to \ndo in San Francisco so yeah if you're in \nSan Francisco or nearby then definitely \ncould be a cool option for you and then \nI also want to do something early March \nprobably in Amsterdam so that should be \npretty cool if you feel like there's a \nlocation that we definitely not covering \nwhere you feel like oh there's a few of \nyou that like the meet up to happen give \nus a shout there's many options maybe \nyou could run it and then we provide you \nsupport or maybe we could help organize \nit ourselves uh let's see how it goes \nbut if you feel like there should be a \nmeet-up I'm more than happy to hear all \nabout it \nnext topic I want to quickly cover is \nGoogle summer of code so I'm not sure if \nany of you is new to it but the whole \nidea is that Google open up this really \ncool project where \nvarious companies especially open source \ncompanies can join in and then propose \nvarious project ideas and then very \nstudents can apply to participate and \nthen the way it works is basically as \nthis like you could go and review some \nof the project ideas \nthat we have so you know we could maybe \nbuild a new demo with a jupyter notebook \nor if you know about Django or any CMS \nthat could do the Vivid integration that \ncould be a pretty cool topic we are \nlooking also for a way to \nImplement code examples into our \ndocumentation that are interactive so \nbasically ones that people could go and \nexecute in the browser but also make \nchanges to them and then ideally it \nwould be great to have them you know in \nPython in JavaScript but also like go \nand and Java that would be pretty cool \num we also would like to see like a an \nimportant tool so it's something that JP \nshowed a few months ago that we had a \nproof of concept we just didn't get to \nbuilding it just yet but if you'd like \nto be part of this that would be really \ncool and \nmaybe you could help us build a new vb8 \nmodule there is all sort of different \nideas and and options like maybe there \ncould be another like uh image to vect \ntype a module using Ray uh why not that \nwould be pretty cool \num we also looking to make some \nimprovements to the Vivid client so if \nyou are interested in helping us make \nour either python Java Juice or go they \ndon't have to be all of them uh clients \nthen give us a shout and perhaps this \ncould be a great project for \ncollaboration and if you have cool ideas \nthat I didn't cover right here there is \nalso an option for like go and propose \nyour own idea right and then in order to \napply and here's how it works usually uh \nthe first step is you go and apply for a \nproject \nand we have two places where you have to \napply for one there's this Google form \nthat we've created so in here you can go \nand then provide like your details your \nlevel of Education where you base and \nthen the next page is basically you say \nwhich project you want to participate in \nand then provide a bit of background as \nto why you think you'll be the best \nperson for it and then also separately \nyou need to go and then submit to \ndirectly to the gsoc page so kind of \nhave to do it in two places and then \nbased on that once we have those \nprojects approved we can then work over \nthe summer so usually projects kick in \nlike mid-june and then they run through \nJuly and August project should be \ncomplete and everybody will be happy so \nyeah I share we've shared the links to \nthe gsoc page so if you go to vividio \nGoogle summer slash G sub 23 the link is \nin the the YouTube channel so you can \nfind it there and same thing for for the \nmeetups we've shared the links as well \nso yeah this is basically the \nannouncement iHeart and \num \nErica you first \nyou suck separate from an internship I \nguess if someone has a question on \ninternships that we make \nyeah it's yeah exactly it's not so it's \nnot exactly an internship but it's very \nsimilar if you think of it so it's \nsomething that is organized by Google or \nby the Google summer of code program we \nalso last year did Google summer of docs \nwhich is why we have docusarus today for \nfor our website but so it's not \nofficially like an internship internship \nbut it's very similar it's like we could \nargue over semantics right like maybe \nyou know semantic says will probably \nmatch them both but they're not exactly \nthe same \num but it's definitely like yeah it's \nlike a single Project based uh \nyeah single product based activity and \nthe way we did it last year as well and \nit would work the same way this year for \nevery project there will be a mentor or \na couple of mentors attached and then \nusually if let's say you Connery were \nlike one of the students or you work \nright like each of you would meet with \nlike a mentor for your project for one \nhour a week and then you would be a like \nyou know discussing what needs to be \ndone what are the next steps uh maybe \nreview the code or maybe review the \nideas and then it kind of like goes on \nand on until the project is complete or \nRuns Out of Time \nand that's kind of the idea yeah \nyeah I was just gonna add there's a \npotential to do really impactful work uh \nSebastian was telling me that some of \nthe modules that we use and the \ncustomers use were actually initially \ninitiated by uh g-soc students right \nwhich modules were those of us yeah so \nand oh my God I think the \nthe open AI module that we have uh it \nactually was built by by student and \nthere was a second one and I'm just \ngoing blank but yeah two two of the \nmodules that we have in Vivid were \ncreated by a student so they \ncollaborated with Martin \num yeah our senior engineer and that was \npretty awesome and also if you look at \nthe Vivid examples so some of the Vivid \nexamples in there were created by uh by \na gsoc student so definitely there's a \nbig big impact and and here's the thing \num the the \nimpact it that the project may have \ndepends on the quality of the output \nright if at the end of let's say that \nimport tool is at the stage of like this \nis a pretty solid uh proof of concept \nbut it needs more work then that's what \nit will be right it will be it could be \nbecome a basis for the next level of the \nproject well if it's something that's \nlike actually this is a fully blown \nfully tested everything like an import \ntool \num that should be ready like we'll \nprobably just like uh say hey this is \nthe author uh and then everyone can use \nit and launch it right so definitely \nthere's a lot of opportunity for an \nimpactful work \nand also it's a it's a cool way to \num raise your profile so if you're \nlooking for a job after that and they're \nlike okay so what you've done you could \nshow like some University projects maybe \nor you could go like I feel this you \nknow thousands of people from the \nviviate uh Community or tens of \nthousands are using it on a daily basis \nyou go like oh that's pretty cool \nright \nso yeah \nany more questions \nno not on mine all right so I think next \nwe should talk about search in widget \nand I know Dan you want it to really \nshare with everyone uh what's what's \nbeen happening in that space in that \nspace yes hi everyone my name is Dan \ntuscalesco and I'm a developer advocate \nfor bb8 on the US West Coast and this is \nmy first time on we be there so thank \nyou Sebastian hey welcome welcome it's \ngreat to have you here what I would like \nto share on my screen is this um new \nsearch feature that we are working on so \nthis is the graphql console for it we \ndon't have a UI yet and this is how you \ncan run queries so for example if you \nwant to learn how to import data you run \na query like this \nand it gives you the content of that \naugmentation page and its URL \nso let's try a different query for \nexample you want to know how to \nsearch by \nconcept \nand I made some purpose there because \num our research polarized that and it \nreturns this content page with a near \ntext filter and again a blog post that \nexplains how to use it so this is going \nto be released at some point in the \nfuture it's going to have a convenient \nsearch interface \nand we're looking forward to get your \nfeedback on this \nthat's so cool but what's that Meme I \nput a search in your search so you could \nsearch while you search I just \nI'm a big fan of the movie Inception and \nthis is something like that \nso I'm curious about how how is getting \nthe data like uh is it like a like a web \nscraper where you get the mark down and \nchunk it up like what went into that \num we'll actually grab the HTML that's \ngenerated so this might not be optimal \nright now \nand the rows are not quite correct at \nthe moment but it's all work in progress \nand um yeah we essentially feed the HTML \nPages import them \nas data objects very simple schema and \nthen \nthere's a search that runs against the \ncontent \nsuper cool \nyeah and I think this is still a little \nbit of work in progress in general but \nhopefully we'll be able to add that \nofficially to to our Vivid search page \nit's a sore topic so I'm excited to see \nthe work on it \nso it's um \nsomething that we must have on the \ndocumentation \nyeah and I mean a big part of like why \nwe haven't done it before \num it's also it's not \nthe challenge is not how easy it is to \nimplement with it with that search I \nthink that the challenge that we looked \nat was that we would be judged based on \nthe quality of results even though that \nnecessarily with it as we did as such we \nare not responsible for creating uh \nthose vectorizer modules right we are \nthe ones that we that that use those \nright to to provide the results so if \nfor some reason the module that we use \ndoesn't help you answer exactly the \nquestion \nwe still would be judged on that whether \nit's uh our responsibility to make that \nmodel respond to those questions or not \nthat's right so we need to increase our \nconfidence scores here and perhaps I'll \ntrain on our specific document domain \nyeah yeah \nyeah I think maybe to preview what we're \ntalking about later I think when you add \nthe generate to this and it's retrieving \nfrom the documentation you say like \nplease write me the code for the new uh \nsay when we add audio to VEC please \nwrite me the audiovec code and it could \ngenerate The Code by retrieving from \nthis information Source just crazy \nyeah that'll be chargpt in your browser \nI mean yeah that that would be pretty \neasy to add right so um and then as \nwe'll probably talk about it towards the \nend of the session \num changing that will be just pretty \nstraightforward thing \nso pretty cool so unless we have any \nother questions we can move on to \nanother topic having said that to your \nquestion earlier than Parker comes to \nthe rescue and I think it is actually \ntext tobacco here and this some \nTransformers were the GSA contributions \nso it's pretty cool \num if if you haven't heard of the \nsummary summarization Transformer \nbecause I think Erica we talked just \nbefore this session and and you're like \noh right I wasn't aware of this this is \nactually a really cool module uh FYI \nthere's like one where you can run any \nquery and then pass it to summarizer and \nthen it can summarize uh the content of \nthat so it could be something that's \nlike 10 paragraphs long piece of content \nand then you could summarize in like a \nshort paragraph or a couple of sentences \nso um that's kind of cool and I see yeah \nyou are just searching for a summarize \nfilter that's pretty cool \nyeah \nall right thanks Dan for this uh demo so \nin the next segment \nwe have who do we have who's next raise \nyour hand \nI think we have Connor talking about the \npipe API right corner awesome super cool \nlet's get into it \nyeah the floor is yours uh Zoom I share \nmy screener yeah let's do it awesome \nsuper cool so I'm so excited to be \npresenting this pipe API proposal so \nthis is something we've been working on \nabout oh sorry \nabout search pipelines so what are \nsearch pipelines so usually what happens \nis we start off with a query like uh \nwhat is reftubec or how do I use the \nsummarize filter and first we use some \nkind of information retrieval like \nretrieval method like hybrid search or \nyou know near text near Vector near \nobject and then what we might want to \nadd in the search pipeline is re-ranking \nwith say a cross encoder or maybe this \nrecommendation cases where you have \nthese more particular learning to rank \nmodels they use these like a more \ncomplex feature engineering but you have \nsome kind of re-ranking phase and then \nmaybe we hand that off to the generate \nmodule so what this API is about is \nabout letting weva users kind of \ndecompose these steps for how they want \nto form these search pipelines within \nwebiate so here's an example of the API \nproposal as it is now so at the top \nlevel pipe is going to be equivalent to \nget aggregate or explore with the key \ndifference being you put kind of the \nchain of the search filters in as the \nargument to pipe so you start off with \nthe query how do I use VBS pipe API and \nthen you have the this could be a query \nto Dan's uh documentation search and \nthen you have the stages so stage one so \nstage one would be the name of stage one \nand then it has Associated parameters \nand then at the end you index the class \nthat you want to be retrieving from so \nsimilar to kind of like git and \naggregate how you have the class and \nthen the properties that you want to \nreturn and the underscore additional so \nso let's kind of Step a little more into \nthis one search pipeline flow of \nretrieve re-rank and then generate \nso what you would have is you would have \na query like what is reftubec and first \nyou hit that with a hybrid search and \nthen you can also chain together the \nwhere filter so Parker came on the uh \npodcast to talk to talk about rough the \nback replication and other things in the \n1.17 release so we have this where \nspeaker equals Parker Duckworth \nsearching through the podcast Clips then \nwhat we'll do is we'll re-rank the uh \nthese outputs from the hybrid search \nwith say a high capacity cross encoder \nthat is uh it's lower but it's more like \nfine grained how it scores the search \nresults so now once we've so we get this \nkind of like coarse grain search result \nfrom our retrieval method then we you \nknow clean it up with the re-ranking and \nnow our top five that we hand off to the \ngenerative module is like you know some \nreally good search results really high \nquality what is ref to vet content so we \ngive that and you know we can do say \nwrite a tweet and this is German this \nwas an earlier iteration of the uh \ngenerate arguments but you get the idea \nof how you pass in the different search \nfilters \nthen you say you want to search through \npodcast clips and you want to see the \nspeaker in the content but it's just a \nrough idea so here are some of the \nsearch Primitives right now that are in \nweba that we're thinking of chaining \ntogether \nso you have the spell check you have you \nknow Vector search with near Vector near \nobject you have bm25 hybrid search and \nthen you have the symbolic filters of \nwhere and then you have so right now we \nhave a symbolic ranking which is sort we \ncan also have the kind of the neural \nre-rank and we're also thinking about \nsay like taking move two and taking that \nkind of vector ranking out of the \nargument to near text and also making \nthat kind of a primitive that you could \nput in the pipe and then we also have \nsay extractive QA summarize and generate \nas things that you could plug into the \npipe API \nso now I want to talk to you about \nsomething that I think is really \nexciting and more more something that's \nkind of on the frontier and that's the \nflow of retrieve generate and then rank \nso the first idea behind this is so \nthese generative models like large \nlanguage models they're stochastic \nmodels so you every time you query it \nit'll give you like a slightly different \noutput because it has this Randomness to \nit and that's also controlled with the \ntemperature parameter as you look at \nlike the uh you know like the open AI \nDaVinci if you go to the playground \nstuff you see that you can slide that \ntemperature which is how random it's \ngoing to be so what you can do is you \ncould sample many potential outputs from \nthe generative model and then re-rank \nthose outputs \nso one example of this is by using \nreward models and this is what's used in \nsay deepmind Sparrow model \nso here's an example let's say we have a \na therapy app so John I can't believe it \nsomeone took my parking spot that I \nalways use when I come here and Bob is \nour uh is our app like hi Bob from the \nfrom the other thing so Bob says well \nit's not like you own the spot it's \nfirst come first serve and John says but \nI always use that spot it's convenient \nand close to the entrance so now we send \nthis to our language model and it \ngenerates several candidate things to \nsay back to John \nI don't have time for this just deal \nwith it and get over it I'm sorry that \nhappened to you and so on so we have \neight different potential Generations \nso now what we're going to do is we're \ngoing to take a sentiment classifier as \none example of reward model and that \nsentiment classifier is going to assign \na positive or negative score to each of \nthese potential outputs so you see I \ndon't have time for this just deal with \nit and get over it that has a negative \n2.5817 score \nI'm sorry that happened to you but it's \nimportant to remember \nso that has a high positive score of \n3.5607 so then what you'll do is you'll \nrank these outputs based on the positive \nscore and in the end this number seven I \nunderstand how you feel but maybe you \ncan use this as an opportunity that's \nwhat ends up getting sent to the user so \nyou've generated all these candidates \nand then you've re-ranked them with some \nkind of classifier and this is so this \nis one way to just kind of they use this \nin like sparrow and papers like that \njust to kind of like filter the quality \nof it so they have all these things like \noh is it reinforcing a stereotype or you \nknow the harmful thing of these large \nlanguage models that scale plugging them \ninto making it like the next Google that \nkind of thing but you can also use this \nfor uh say say you're going to be using \na cheaper language model like you know \nthe da Vinci one I think is like two \ncents per thousand tokens generated and \nI'll tell you about how much money I \nspent on the demo later on but like \nmaybe you want to use a lower capacity \nmodel and you sample a ton of outputs \nfrom it because it's cheaper and then \nyou can re-rank those outputs like this \nso it's like another interesting thing \nof what we can kind of achieve with the \npipeline so then let's talk about \nanother way of re-ranking Canada \nGenerations which is personalizing them \nor recommending them \nso earlier we presented ref to VEC which \nis a way of representing a user based on \nwhat they like with a vector so you can \ndo this online online recommendation \ncase \nso what we can do is we can similarly \ngenerate a bunch of candidates and then \nwe can re-rank them to personalize the \noutput to use so say we go into our \nstable diffusion model and Erica comes \nwith some shoes that she wants and it \ngenerates all these shoes and then it \nand it learns to re-rank the candidate \nGenerations based on you know which \nshoes Eric has been interacting with \nso to kind of come back to this this is \nsort of the early thinking behind the \npipe API design you know you put these \ndifferent stages in like this kind of \nsyntax and so we'd really appreciate it \nif you want to join us in this \ndiscussion on GitHub so if you go to \ngithub.com \nissues and this is issue 2560 so we \nwould really love it if you would join \nthis conversation let us know what you \nthink about this pipe API design \nperfect this has been great and by the \nway we've included the link in the \ndescription of the video so don't \nnecessarily type it yourself but that's \nthe link definitely uh for all of you to \ncome in and \nyeah we'd love to hear your feedback \nyour ideas \num I I know we talked about it Connor \nbefore and and I really like what that \nwhat you could do with pipeline but it's \nlike it was a bit of an eye-opener when \nyou showed the example with this like \nsentiment uh example search like \ngenerate the results and then score them \nbased on the sentiment \nand in a way because there's no like one \nway of doing it because you could \nactually say like hey I want to uh \nrespond with a super polite answer or I \nwant to be really nasty or you go I want \nto find a happy medium I don't want to \nbe overly polite but they want to be \nrude either so that that gives power to \nyou like when you write a query to to \nmake it exactly how it should be it's \nit's pretty awesome and and I like how \nthere's so many possibilities right \nbecause you could check it for like is \ndoes this use inclusive language or it \ncould it be you know culturally \ninappropriate etc etc and and I know \neven like there's some startups \nthat help rewrite job descriptions so \nthat they are more inclusive because \nthere's like for example certain \nlanguage that is very helpful for people \nlike me middle-aged white guy right but \neverybody else feels like oh I don't \nlike this content so I think this kind \nof use cases could be achieved with this \npipeline it's like it's amazing so I \nlike it I like it a lot \nif my therapist outfitted that first \nresponse I would fire it I guess it \nbecause I don't know gender but um also \nwhere would you include the positive \nsentiment I guess if you can go back to \nthe oh okay so I meant to uh so in this \nkind of part I'm more so saying like \nokay here's what we can here's what we \ncan do with pipe sort of As We Lay the \nfoundation from it I think sort of this \nis the thing I would recommend looking \nat first this is sort of the next step \nfor pipe because um when you're going to \nbe doing generations with the da Vinci \nmodel you're going to be spending a bit \nof money on the on the generation so it \nmakes a lot of sense to me that you \nwould want to re-rank your search \nresults so the trade-off with re-ranking \nis that it's a little slower it's also \nmaybe a little harder to maintain \nbecause now you have another container \nwith the with another Transformer in it \nthat's going to be scoring the query \ndocuments and giving that high capacity \nscore but this I think is like the next \nstep of massively added value and then \nwith this I with um sorry with this idea \nof the reward model ranking I think we \ncould introduce something like a you \nknow classifiers as another we V8 module \nis you know maybe that's another module \nto build for the Google summer of code \nyeah hey yeah yeah that's cool that it \nwould be implemented and we need so \ninstead of having to Define it yourself \nbe like positive class negative I don't \nknow who would want to use the negative \nbut \nwell it depends you may want to just \nlike put a lot of pressure on somebody \nright just like uh \nlike in negotiations when you want to be \nreally tough you shouldn't need to be \nnice right \noh we should have like an alpha score \nlike we have for hybrid it's like \npositive negative like right in the \nmiddle \nthere we go \nmodul API is being designed \nyeah that's lovely it's lovely is there \nlike any time frame of like for by when \nwe want to hear hear this feedback or \nwhat's what's there could we have a \ndiscussion maybe on slack or should we \njust all focus on this GitHub issue \nwhat's what's your preference I think \nthe GitHub issue is a great place to \ndiscuss if you go there now you'll see \nuh edians left some initial comments and \nso like if if you sort of look at what \nEd Ian's done that's sort of the perfect \nexample of I guess how these GitHub \nissue conversations happen edians like \nthe the master of the repository I'd say \nand it's still something new for me to \nbe learning honestly this open source \nthe way that the issues are open is just \nreally fascinating I'd recommend \nchecking this out even if just it's to \nsee what these kind of Open Source \nissues look like foreign \nit's pretty amazing \ncool cool let me check because there \nmight be some uh \nquestions some questions about the \nGoogle summer of code in the chat \nyeah so I I could probably \ndo that so like suppose I'm into \ninterested in a particular project from \nthe gsoc list what should be the next \nsteps so NG edits so Angie I think that \nthe best step would be you could so \nfirst of all join this slack Community \nfor for wibit which I'm pretty sure you \nalready are part of and then in there we \nhave a g-soc channel \num if if you have an idea on working on \nsome of those projects you can ping us \nthere like Drop say like hey I'm \ninterested in this project what what \nshould we next is we could maybe have a \nconversations if you already have an \nidea of how would you want to approach \nit or if you could come up like hey if I \nhad three months I would do this in \nfirst Monday second this third or some \nsort of anything to kind of like just \nget going and that'll be probably a good \nthing and and honestly like this step is \njust go and then apply \nuh to uh through the two links that I \nshared earlier so you'll be pretty good \nlike that \nand on a different font of like talking \nabout uh get up and at the end you know \nI think it's like if you see say his \nname three times you actually \nso like I think here he is so we have at \nthe end I was like yeah definitely like \nthis is something that we truly believe \nin right like we are not a GitHub we are \nnot an open source company just for \nmarketing like or this is not a \nmarketing strategy it's literally how we \nwant to run our business how we want to \ncommunicate because this is the best way \nfor for all of us to do the best and and \nI always like kind of like use this \nexample \nit and that's part of like diversity you \nknow the power of diversity and power of \nlike having all these opinions if you \nhave like five people coming from \nHarvard and you give them a tough \nproblem they will give you a really good \nsolution right but if you take people \nfrom like five different completely \ndifferent places they'll give you five \ndifferent solutions and quite possibly a \ncouple of them will be better than the \nthat single one from Harvard right so \nthat diversity of ideas and things that \nyou may see or may have missed \num yeah it's just so important to to \nalways appreciate \nso yeah that's just my little few cents \ncool so I don't see any more questions \nfor now I hope uh everyone is enjoying \nit and by the way like for those that \nyou listen like drop us a message from \nof like where you uh listening from and \nthen just just say hi in general like \nthat that's enough not all interactions \nhave to be questions so uh and if you \nsay something nice I'll show you as well \non the on the screen as a banner so why \nnot \ncool so like I said we're leaving the \nfinal topic uh the best topic for the \nlast so that's not to say that the other \ntopics were important but I think we are \nsuper excited about the genitive search \nuh project oh well there will be a demo \nso I think I would pass the floor to \nmaybe then then you have like some \nopening ideas and you want to discuss \nyeah we can talk about \nwell first we'll talk about what \ngenerative search is a little bit later \non but I wanted to talk about \ngpt3 what chat GPT is and what are some \nof the shortcomings of chat GPT \num I don't have to tell you what chat \ngbt is it's the fastest growing app \nservice it was the it reached 100 \nmillion uh daily active users I think it \nwas a monthly or daily I can't remember \nnow but in two months the next closest \nis Tick Tock which got there in I \nbelieve nine months \num so everybody knows what chat GPT is \nbut uh one of the things that is super \ninteresting that's coming up on Twitter \neven before while we were working on \nthis module in the background \nI was looking over Twitter and people \nwere like oh this would be cool if we \ncould have a personalized version of \nthis right what if we could have uh our \ninternal uh organization docs trained on \nchat EBT so that it could become a \nautomated uh HR chat bot or an automated \num I don't know like a customer service \nchat bot where it knows what products I \nhave on my Ecommerce store which ones \nare on sale which ones are on clearance \nand it could answer all of these \nquestions \num not just in a robotic way but \nkind of taking your own data and then \nhaving it uh \nhaving the power of the generative \nmodule of chat GPT right getting it to \ncreatively answer and realistically \nanswer questions with your own data \nand so that that really is the utility \nof the uh generative open AI module that \nwe announced this week yesterday in fact \nand so the main idea is the power of \nchat GPT the creativity of chat CPT \neverything we like about chat gbt but \ncustomize to your own data and the \napplications are really Limitless \num so we wanted to talk about that a \nlittle bit there are some questions that \nI had and instead of getting on a call \nwith Connor one-on-one and kind of \nuh talking about and expanding my \nunderstanding I thought that we could \ntake advantage of my ignorance and for \nfor the benefit of the wider audience we \ncould ask those questions here but um \nConnor if you'd like to add in details \nto that \nyeah I think coming off of what you just \nsaid I what I love about this idea of \nhow we v8's integrated chat GBC is so I \nused to think that you were going to \nneed to fine-tune the language model on \nyour data so you know you'd have to have \nthis 175 billion parameter model and \nthere are these advances in like sparse \nfine-tuning that meant that you know it \nwas getting more cost effective \nbut still I mean you have to do some \ngradient descent optimization on your \ndata and that to me seemed really \nambitious but now what we have is this \nGeneral reasoning ability that can you \njust provide the data with search and \nthen it can reason across the search \nresults and it and it has this like \nlocal memory kind of thing that you can \ndo where you you can prompt it to like \nkind of store intermediate uh outputs to \novercome that 4096 uh context length and \nthat I think is just so powerful that \nkind of local memory in in addition to \nthe external memory I think that you \ndon't need to fine-tune the language \nmodel and that I think is the big I I \nhonestly am so surprised that this that \nit ended up working out like this \nyeah I thought I thought we would have \nto do something similar and I think I I \nwas talking I was looking at this um \npress release from Microsoft actually \nyesterday and they might eventually go \ndown that route for like an Enterprise \nversion of chat CBT where you have the \nability to fine tune but if you use the \nnew module that we released the results \nwith just providing context and then \ngrounding your prompt or task in that \ncontext are pretty fascinating it gets \npretty much the entire job done \nyeah it's really interesting maybe Erica \nyou could talk about your early \nexperience with just Chad gbt first \nthoughts on it and \noh yeah I think the main point I wanted \nto cover was extractive versus \ngenerative \num question answering so chatbots aren't \nnew but what is near aesthetic you're \nable to give it like this open-ended \nprompt um so like you said you're able \nto ground the question in the content \nthat you just gave it and I'm going to \nshow a demo and give an example on this \nbut I mean it's just fascinating like \ninstead of just like a quick short \nanswer of just extracting it from the \nparagraph that you gave at that it can \nlike generate a paragraph a tweet a \nFacebook ad it's like fascinating that \nit even knows what a tweet is and it's \npretty accurate \num which is really cool so that's just \none thing I want to cover but also like \njust for like an HR or chatbot like that \nkind of the ability for it to extract \ninformation and then summarize all of it \nis really cool \nis that what generative searches this is \none of the questions I had what's the \ndifference between generative search and \nsearch so I know in search \nyou can ask a question and then it'll \ngive you like 100 pages of resources \nthat you'll have to peruse through to \nget the answer right what is generative \nsearch \nyeah well if I'll take I'll start this \noff and then and think about like um \nyeah like I take it as I think \ngenerative search started as an academic \nterm to refer to you would have the \nlanguage models just general like same \nwith the stochastic sampling that you \nre-rank with the therapy app you'd use \nthe language models to generate \ncandidate answers and that would be like \nyour search is like you get the \ninformation from the language model but \nI think now what the term is evolving to \nmean is just like that generative layer \nat the end of search so you search and \nthen you give it to the generative model \nthat's how I'm thinking that that term \nis going to evolve \nit yeah so I feel it's it's an evolving \nterm at this point there was a a press \nconference from the CEO of Microsoft \nyesterday that I was watching and he I \nthink he shared a similar concept he \ndidn't call it genitive search he called \nit AI backed search and the and the \nwhole point there is instead of giving \nyou the 10 most relevant links it'll \ngive those 10 most relevant links to the \nuh the large language model and the \nlarge language model interprets and \nproduces a relevant answer regarding \nthat content and then it cites those uh \nsources in the in the at the bottom \nthere right which is pretty interesting \nbecause now you can \nwith search but before search we had to \ngo through and look through lots and \nlots of resources this is relevant this \nis not relevant the initial concept of \nsearch made that easy now feeding that \ninto AI makes the next part of our job \neasier so he was saying how \nit's not that it's going to do your job \nfor you it's just going to take the \nresults and interpret them and give you \na potential first draft that you can \nthen improve on you accept this don't \naccept this which is pretty interesting \nthere's also a bit of philosophical \ndebates when it comes to \num image search for example generative \nsearch for Samurai sub gate Golden Gate \nBridge during fog in the spring at 8am \nthere probably is a picture of that but \nthatly could also generate one that \nwould be near indistinguishable from \nreality so as a user does it matter to \nget a real picture or generate one at \nsome point you won't be able to tell the \ndifference \nyeah and I know that both Google and \nMicrosoft are are working on stuff like \nthis where if you're searching for \nimages they're not just going to bring \nyou images that are sourced from \nsomewhere on the web now if they think \nthat they can create a better image from \na model like dally or the open source \nversion of uh similar to that stable \ndiffusion you'll actually be able to see \nfake and real images which is pretty \ninteresting and the same thing could \nhappen for music audio Google just came \nout with this model called music LM you \ncan describe what type of music what you \nwant to generate and it'll create like \n30 second five minute clips of it for \nyou and so it's not just \nquestion answering text to text or text \nto image it's all sorts of modalities \nthat are coming up now it's so exciting \nto be in the space \nyeah I think as a user if you ever give \nme like a response that is like \nautomated generated that is not like a \nbite person or something I would always \nwant to have a flag something that lets \nme know this was generated because uh \nbecause I think there's a an element of \ntrust when I get something this is real \nversus generated and and I actually in \nthe past wrote an article about \nwhether chatbot should pretend to be \npeople or whether you should always be \naware because in my opinion if you ever \ntalk to a chatbot and then you find out \nlike six comments later that this wasn't \na real person while you were like super \npolite and everything \num and by the way you should always be \npolite even to chatbots \num like you you would feel like you \nnever know right but you you you you \nwould feel cheated right you would go \nlike oh I built this trust build this \nrelationship I ex like spend this energy \nand then it's like it's just a machine \nright like it's like what the hell so I \nthink I'd want to know the truth you \nknow like if I'm in The Matrix tell me \nyeah \nsorry really quick \num when using Chachi BTO we start with \nplease I don't know why but when I had \nto start paying for it I was like ah let \nme excuse like a minute please because I \ndon't want it to use that as a token now \nthat it's your service \nso so you know this technique like when \nyou're dating somebody for the first \ntime you know what kind of people they \nare based on how they talk to their chat \nBots right \nto Tinder and then it gives you a \npersonality score \nyeah well I wanted to actually relay \nthis back to Eric anyways because what \nSebastian was saying about truthfulness \nand I know Erica has built this demo \nthat she's going to show us soon about \nwhere you you know there's like this \nkind of SEO content where you know you \ngenerate it to hit the keywords so what \ndo you think like should websites that \ndo this like kind of just like brute \nforce a ton of const content that comes \nout of language models what do you think \nis the future of that \nI think having the source is extremely \nimportant like Sebastian said like \nbuilding that trust but also knowing \nwhere it comes from \num I had asked chat to BT a few \nquestions and I was like huh like is \nthis taking is the content that it's \ngiven me from Wikipedia is it from \nsomeone's personal blog post like can I \nuse this can I relay it \num so I think like a track of these \nsources is very important \num yeah whether it's generated or real I \ndon't think that matters as long as the \nsource is there and it's clear with that \nthe other thing that's super cool to \nthink about that is if you're taking \nChachi BT and not just asking a general \nknowledge questions or publicly \navailable questions that can be answered \nwith public publicly available \ninformation but more \nproprietary information you don't really \nwant it to hallucinate details like if I \nask a HR chat bot when's the next \ncompany social or when the next holiday \nis or something like that I don't want \nit to give me a fake answer that's \nthat's stochastically optimized on on \npreviously pre on my training set I \nwanted to give me real facts right it \ncan flourish it by telling me Oh you \nmight want to book like a flight or \nsomething two days in advance for this \nbut I don't want it to give me fake \ninformation \num how do you limit \nhallucination in a in a like a \ncustomizer private application of chat \nGPT can you limit it or \nsounds scary \nyeah it's a really great question well \nit kind of comes back to when Erica \nbrought up the extractive QA versus \ngenerative models as well like I think \nthe extractive classified the answer in \nthe context I think that still has a ton \nof value especially because it's I mean \nit's way cheaper it's super fast like if \nyou're putting this into your website do \nyou want to pay however many I mean like \nI don't know like you'd have to do the \nmath of like how many viewers you have \nany questions right but like the \nextractive QA model where it's \nclassifying the answer in the context I \nthink that will still have a lot of \nvalue \nalso with the temperature like with the \nQ a opening how we have that it's like \nreducing the randomness I think is \nimportant but also still generating the \nlike of balance \nlike yeah just setting temperature to \nzero and yeah \nso can you explain what happens if you \nset temperature to zero it takes away it \ntakes away the stochasticity completely \nor \nthat's a good question I don't know if \nit takes it away completely but yeah \nthat's the scale more deterministic \ntowards zero ah okay \nright \nyeah I did test it out and I had \ntemperatures set um really high I don't \nknow I didn't check it and it um I think \nmy question was on what is Rapture fact \nand it outputted a Labrador Retriever as \npopular in America I was like I didn't \neven mention a dog like what's happening \nkeep that one internal so it was \nconfident \nhey don't don't you know why they are \nrelated come on it's so obvious maybe it \nknows something I don't I guess I don't \nknow maybe they're both super \nenthusiastic and full of energy and \ncan't help themselves when there's food \naround \nI know Sebastian was touching on this as \nwell but \nhow much would it cost let's say I \nwanted to just try this out as a hobby \nuh this module that we released how much \nwould it cost me \num \nyeah so right now you're paying about \ntwo cents per thousand tokens generated \nand when I do my demo I'm going to start \noff by let's go into the playground \nlet's see how much how many tokens we're \nlooking at realistically but um yeah I \nmean My Demo cost me fifteen dollars \nso yeah you have like a 15 certificate \nlike I know my stuff you know I've \ninvested time sweat and money fifteen \ndollars at two cents per thousand \nprompts that's a lot of problems \nyeah I think you're being charged for \nthe prompt too what \nI suppose it makes sense maybe the like \nthe way that they batch the inputs or \nsomething like that I'm really not sure \nbut yeah that's interesting \nwould it be a good time to actually then \njump into like the the within \nintegration because I know we have a \ncouple of demos and then because then we \ncould also use it as a context maybe and \nthat could be relevant like all the \ntemperature and kind of results \num because I know Erica you have demo \nright should I share your screen because \nI think that'll be pretty cool like this \nis super cool stuff right like I'm gonna \ngo quiet now \nfloor is yours \nso I'll start with the docker file um so \nI we you have to use the latest version \nof bb8 which is 117.3 or a newer version \num you can also run this in WCS I mean \nyou can use the free sandbox for 30 days \num it is already implemented in WCS you \ncan do that as well um but for this demo \nI'm using I'm running it locally \num so one thing to note is in the enable \nmodules you have to use the generative \nopenai and you have to include this with \nthe vectorizer that you are using in \nthis demo I'm using text spec openai \nSebastian has other ideas but you can \nalso use any \nvectorizer cohere hiding face and the \nother one Sebastian \nyeah pretty much any any vectorizer that \nthat you have that we have you could use \nit with with open AI uh with this like \nthe generative open AI because this is \nthe really cool thing \num the generative uh module is not used \nfor a query right so like you search for \nuh for your results and then once you \nhave the results you pass it on to the \nthe genjive module and go like hey I got \nthis result what can you do about it so \ntechnically you could actually just do a \nscalar search without any vectors still \nretrieve results like you could say like \ngive me the results where title equals \nthis or like this that's not a vector \nsearch and yet you could retrieve some \nresults and opacity to a generative \nmodule to kind of go like now create a \nresponse for it right so that's that's \nwhat I'm kind of saying like as much as \nyour demo Erica uses to open AI based \nmodules they could you could use \nanything so the kind of stuff that if \nyou're already building with V8 \num you can just that at General open eye \nto it and then boom you have an extra \noption \npossibilities are unless \nright now so many so many possibilities \nand then this is where you will add your \nopenai key I've hidden my secret key so \nI don't get charged a lot of money \num but you can also import at import \ntime as an import query time \num instead of in the docker file um so \nit is up to you \nall right I will show my data um so I'm \nusing the podcast on uh from Connor \nParker and edian on the 117 release \num so you can see we have three property \nproperties we have speaker content and \nthen the podcast number \num Conor has a GitHub repository on um I \nthink you have like 15 maybe already \ncomplete yeah 15 out of the 35 but I'll \nget it done \nand I guess I could omit pod number \nbecause it is only I'm only using the 31 \nbut just so you know if you clone the \nrepository uh this will change all right \nnow I'm going to go over to my schema \num so this is standard the real the cool \npart about the generative module is \nthere really is nothing different about \nit \num for the schema so just like to have \nany instance running with me that you \nneed to have a schema \num so here I'm just pointing out that I \nhave my class the Pod clip which is \npodcast and then just my three \nproperties which is content speaker pod \nnumber and I'm using the text to back \nopen AI module \nall right and then uploading is standard \nit's what we've all seen and if you \naren't familiar with it if you have a \ngreat quick start tutorial end to end is \nwhat I think it's called and you can \nreference that it's extremely helpful \nand Sebastian and JP have worked very \nhard on it all right and now on to the \nfun part of the console \nall right so here we have the query so \nwe have pod clip and I'm using hybrid \nsearch \num so my query is what is rectifac and \nI'm setting my output as 0.5 so it's \ndoing the mixture of hybrid oh sorry of \ndense and sparse a search and I'm \nlimiting it to one \num just because that's all that is \nneeded and I'm output I'm retrieving the \ncontent from that which again is where \nthey're speaking about reftubec \num and by they I mean it's either Connor \npark or onion and then uh this is the \nnew part is additional so have generate \nsingle result and I'm giving it a prompt \nso my question is what is reftubec and \nI'm asking it oh no I didn't includes \nplease see I wasn't lying \num answer the question based on the \ncontent that is given from up here you \ndon't have to be polite and then I'm \njust going to Output the single result \nand I included the question what is \nreftubec because I found that it always \nincluded it and the the generative \nmodule always had a question so I just \nthought it'd be easier to Define it here \nand then just the answer \num so you can see uh that it answers \nwhat brought to back centroid is \nETC but the really cool part is that it \nis condensing this content bit into like \na few sentences \nany questions anything small Point \nanything out \nyeah so that um \nparameter that you have like that \ncontent thing \nwhat what is that doing exactly \nso that's a good note content is just a \nproperty of pod clip so I don't want \npeople to think that content is \num like you have in your data you have \nto have content it could be \num like ratings or that's about it or \nreview I guess so if if I had a property \nreview this is where I would replace it \nhere and then also here so that is \nsomething to keep in mind \nmaybe we could try adding speaker above \ncontent \nand then in the prompt uh please answer \nwhat speaker setup said about content \nwould that be fun for everyone \nyou you can do that \nspeaker \nyeah so maybe yeah \nuh please answer what \nare you speaker oh yeah in the curly \nbrackets or maybe instead of the \njust was so then it would be like please \nanswer what Parker Duckworth said about \ncontent \nI said you could embed the speaker \nproperty can you yeah so so it's putting \nin the speaker result into that prompt \ntemplate \nwill there be a should I oh \nlet's run it enter what uh actually yeah \nyeah cool see what happens let's see \noh \nthis is going to be cool \noh Parker was speaking about it but \nyeah yeah \nmaybe like please include something \nabout who said it yeah I think that I \nthink you've done a great job of just \nshowing that you can do the two \nproperties \nyeah \nyeah \nthat's a cool idea \nmaybe I'll get it to work while we talk \nabout something else \nor not yeah I think it already works \nall right so this is uh so in the \ngenerate module we have added single \nresult but we also have grouped result \nand what this is doing is well what is \nhappening there we go \num we have added group result um so \ninstead of a prompt it is being assigned \na task \num so here I'm also I want I'm using \nVector search sorry about that to get to \nreturn where they are speaking about \nhybrid search \nand I'm setting my certainty to 0.75 \njust so it's um as accurate as possible \nright \num I'm limiting it to three \nlet's see \nI think this would be in the history \nI just wanna \nlet me just show \nhold on sorry \non the Fly I guess maybe one extra curly \nbracket \nall right so here's the content where \num speaker \nsorry \nall right so here's the content where \nConnor is speaking about hybrid search \nthen we also have Parker this is hit \nwhere he's speaking about it and then \nalso edian \nright so if I add in the uh generate the \ngroup result it's going to consider \nthese three results \noh no here we go \nand it's being tasked with combining the \nresults which are which are the three \nthat I just showed and um condensing it \ninto one paragraph \non explaining what hybrid search is oh \nno \noh wait I know that worked all right so \nhere we have hybrid search is a \ncombination of keyword scoring and such \nas tfid yet it does a great job how \namazing is that and again it's just um \noutputting content because that is what \nis in my schema and not because you have \nto use content but yeah and that's \nSeptember \nhey this is pretty cool \nI had a question about this limit what \nif \nso from what I understand we're using we \nV8 to filter the context and then \nprovide the prompt and the context to \nthe open AI API \num is there a limit to how much context \nwe could provide \nyes I think Connor had some trouble \num like if it is too long I think open \nAI times up I believe yeah I have a \nlittle recommendation for that on the \nfly if you under if you go to error so \nByron added error above group drizzle \nand maybe let's go ahead and put limit \nto 30 to break it on purpose \nhere yeah nailed it 30. \nyeah so if you so it'll tell you you \nknow hey you try to give it uh in this \ncase okay yeah \nalso I feel like if you're kick report \nlet me just limit it to three it also \nkind of \nit doesn't help so why not limit one \nlimit three I think in the first one I \nhad limit one yeah \nI'm just here \nyeah I think it's really cool like um if \nI can add on this limit thing well this \nwhole kind of like so we've yet to \nimplement it with asynchronous calls so \nthe open AI so like if you want to do uh \nsummarize all the podcast Clips then you \nit can do it will do all those calls for \nall the podcast Clips like in parallel \nand I thought that was really nice like \nI was previously I was looping through \nit in Python and you know I'd be sitting \nthere for like five minutes waiting for \nall the calls to get back \nI mean that's the part of the beauty of \ndeveloper experience in viviate right \nlike it's all about making making your \njob a lot easier than uh it needs to be \nright \num I think there's one thing Erica in \nthe first demo for the single search \nright or single result because at the \nmoment you're limited to one but um if \nthe limit was five then basically what \nwe would do is run the query and then \nfor each response you'll get one \ngenerated answer right so definitely \ndon't necessarily run it on like if you \nhave 10 000 objects on like all ten \nthousand because there'll be a lot of \ntokens \num so it's good definitely to to limit \nand now we because yeah this will \nperform five parallel uh requests but \nyou don't need to worry about like doing \nit one by one just like Corner set \nso um this is cool because so now we \nshould get five answers right \nokay let's check it out \nlook at it go \nso if we had type uh operator now then \nwe could take these answers and then \nmaybe do some sort of analysis of each \nanswer and then rescore that and reorder \nor like just provide like the best \nanswer right \nyeah yeah amazing yeah because he was \nlike are you still talking about reftube \nor are you talking about uh Labradors \nyou know like \nright like maybe there could be like a \nfield uh some sort of modular can gen \ndouble check if this is a true answer or \nif it's a hallucinated nonsense or star \nyeah brilliant and it lives in weavia so \nnicely I think the yeah \nyeah amazing very nice \nwell done cool demo Erica yeah awesome \njob here Christ \nthank you \nso \num what should we cover next Conor did \nyou also have a demo that you wanted to \nshow or yeah my demo will be quick it \nbuilds on Erica's demo using the same \ndata set and the same idea and yeah if I \ncould share my screen um so yeah there's \none there's one kind of one more thing I \nwant to add to this which is um \nthat was my screenshot all right so \nfirst let's let's go into the open AI \nplayground and let's see how much 4096 \ntokens is \nall right so if everyone sees my screen \nhere uh this is the playground for open \nAI so so this is a segment uh from this \nis the uh transcript of Bob's demo on \nour new podcast announcing the generate \nmodule so this is 622 tokens this blob \nof tech so let's you know just keep \ngoing \nwhat's a token is is a water token or \nwhat makes a token awesome question so \nso token is you is like it's like a part \nof a word so it usually be like three \ncharacters together so so you the \ntokenizers they look at the statistics \nof the commonly co-occurring characters \nand then they try to compress the groups \nof characters so you have like wordpiece \ntokenizers by pair encoding they're like \nall these different techniques but uh \nyeah I I think with the new era you can \njust drop it into open Ai and see how \nyour tokenized account but I'd also \nrecommend if you are curious about this \nof seeing um you know hugging face has \nthe auto tokenizers Library so if you \nwant to play around a tokenizers that's \na great resource for it okay so so no \nthat's a quick question on that yeah um \nso what about stemming and stop or do \nyou think that could improve \nor search results are \nthat's an interesting question with with \nlike how you would remove stop words for \nhandoffs to the generate module I think \nit's probably best not to do that \nbecause it probably uses all these \nlittle language Clues so like stop words \nwould remove uh like the and yeah things \nlike that and I think those little \nlanguage Clues do help a lot that's the \nkind of like the templating thing with \nthe speaker said content on date those \nlittle words in there that you actually \nlike help it a little bit \nOkay cool so so this is 4 400 tokens so \nif we just kind of \nyou know it's it's a good bit of text \nthat chat gbt these gbt models can take \nin so you know one two three four you \nknow it can take in you know roughly \nseven of Bob's demo transcripts no \nthat's like the most hand wavy \nmeasurement ever but like just to get a \nsense of how much you can take in so so \nit's it's pretty good at taking in you \nknow it can take in pretty long context \nbut you know you can't put an entire \ncode base in there you can't put an \nentire book in there right so you we \nstill need these clever strategies and \nand that's the reason why I think we've \nyet is just so exciting and like this \npositioning of the language model and \nthe vector databases is so exciting \nbecause chat gbt offers this reasoning \nbut then it needs help with the memory \nbecause you know set six paragraphs or \nso it's it's like a lot but it's not \nlike unlimited right so there are two \nthings that I want to talk about and the \nfirst of which is breaking down a task \ninto subtasks \nand the other of which is top level \nindexing so then and then first I want \nto thank our friends at langchain and \ngbt index uh Harrison and Jerry both \nthey're both going to be on the podcast \nwe've been publishing those podcasts \nsoon and they've done incredible work on \npioneering the tools in this kind of \nspace of decomposing tasks into chains \nof language model calls and also the top \nlevel index Construction \nso let's talk about how we're going to \nbreak down the task I'm sorry this is I \nwas like rushing to get this done before \nso I hope this like it's not as neat as \nErica's with the docker file and all \nthat but you'll see the idea hey the \nhistory is happening live here in you \nknow here live you know that's important \nyeah I'm still finishing it now but the \num \nokay so we're going to Loop through each \nof the podcast clips and the prompt is \ngoing to be please write a summary of \nthis podcast clip so that that is stored \nand so here's the next thing we can \nwrite data back to eviate from the \nlanguage model so the language model is \ngoing to generate a short summary and \nit's going to write that in weviate so \nnow you have pod clip has short summary \nshort summary a new Eva class and so so \nthen we're going to aggregate the short \nsummaries into a group summary so so you \nknow this again so we're trying to get \naway from that 4096 token length if I \ntake all these short summaries and just \ntry to put them into GPT and say \nsummarize this it goes error this you've \ntried to give me like 12 000 tokens so \nwe group them into group summaries and \nthen we're going to summarize the whole \npodcast with the summary of the group \nsummaries and then what we can do so \nthis last thing is What's called the top \nlevel index so now we can search through \nthe summaries so so let's say I want to \nsay uh you know what's the most similar \npodcast to podcast number 35 you know \ngenerative search with leviate I now \nhave a Vector representation of these \npodcasts which are these like wildly \ncomplex objects so you know say you have \nscientific paper and it has passage has \npassage like now you have a top level \nindex you have some Vector \nrepresentation of the whole paper and so \nwith ref to VEC we were looking at you \naverage the embeddings of these passages \nbut now we have this new controller with \nthe ability of the large language model \nto summarize that gives us another way \nof forming that Vector representation at \nthe top level so \nso I mean My Demo isn't uh super \norganized but oh sorry so you can just \nsee the uh on the uh so you can see the \nuh the summary so so in the end all \npause summary oh yeah oh no oh yeah \nall right so in the end you can see the \nuh so the All pod summary so if we want \nto say \nuh so let's say we take this is the \npodcast with or let me say so this is a \npodcast with Bob \nso the most recent one that just came \nout uh sorry \nah well let me copy and paste this \nall right let's do that much \nso if we just add here \na near text \nand Concepts \nthis one nope \nsorry about that \nwait so \nanyway so that kind of idea of \noh sorry about that \nokay let me just start eating let me \njust say good all-pod summary \nuh let's do \nnew attacks \nsorry everyone for the delay on this all \nright \nlet's just say concepts we're going \nthat's part of live coding right like um \nsometimes you may say character it's \nhard to find \nOkay cool so okay so what we have here \nis the so it's searching through the \nsummaries of all the podcasts \nso we say you know it's saying uh the \npodcast with Jonathan Franco where he \nwas talking about uh Mosaic ML and we \ndid also talk about uh the self-ask \nprompting and all that so so you can see \nhow you like now you have this top level \nindex so so this is the recent podcast \nof Bob and this is the podcast with uh \nBob Chris and Marco where we talked \nabout uh facts and how they're using \nlarge language models in search so so \nyeah so you have this top level index \nthat comes from breaking up the task \ninto first summarize the podcast Clips \nuh then summarize the um \nyou know the summaries and then form the \noverall summary so it's how you \ndecompose the language model calls and \nand achieve the memory that lets you \novercome the 4096 tokens \ncool so that's all I got \nnice \nso yeah cool \nso that's basically yeah the generated \nanswers already so I guess yeah because \nif you keep uh if you already have the \nanswers right like you don't have to \nregenerate them over and over again \nright that's the idea \nyeah \nCoco hey I I've got a question and back \nto like Erica's demo originally right \num or if we were to do like um a \ngenerative search on this could you make \nit uh to respond in another language \nlike say like hey given the context of \nthis what is this explain in Spanish or \npolish or German is that possible I did \nI did see Bob's demo had um write the \ntweet in Dutch I can't read Dutch but I \ntook his word for it and he says I know \nDutch so \nmaybe we'll go back from summary of \nsummaries back to a summary in Dutch \nyou want you may want to limit it to \nlike two three right \nin Spanish \nyes \nforeign \nnow who speaks Spanish here \nErica speaks a little bit of Spanish \noh Don you and I when we're in Italy we \ntried that communicating in Spanish \nright like maybe you can figure out the \nSpanish yeah but yeah result in the uh \nfirst return \nI think it helps to \npick it up like this \nwhy not just please summarize it in \nSpanish and then end with content \nplease summarize \nthis \nplease write the summary oops sorry \nokay stop \nyo \nso you definitely passed you're \ndefinitely passing the the chatbot \npoliteness communication test yeah \nit's a proof that Conor is a nice person \nin real life too \nokay I'm sorry I don't know why it's \num \nI think kind of the way you format it \num \nwell I guess we'll just have to figure \nit out another time or something and \nlet's see what happens \nwhat if you don't do please write in \nSpanish like is there just the syntax \nissue or yeah oh I got it working okay \nthat's good Erica nice message to Erica \nno worries that's part of like live \ncoding right so uh let's do it \noh I think answer in Spanish \ncan't be translated so we have some like \nMiami Spanish going on \nthank you \ntoday that is epic nice nice \nso impressive so impressive \ncool I guess \num \nthat's most of the stuff we have to \ncover right for today and um any final \nquestions any any takes anything from \nanyone \nhere in the audience \nyeah if you ask any question when this \nis not running live I won't be able to \nretrospectively go into my time machine \nand answer it so I'm sorry for that my \ntime machine it's out of battery at the \nmoment \nthat's cool \nand we promise to give you real answers \nwe're not going to use uh machines just \nyet or do we I'll do it well we promise \nwe won't let you we won't be caught yeah \ndefinitely \nall right uh Team uh thanks for for this \namazing session thank you all for \nwatching and listening and and then \nplease let us know your feedback your \nideas uh just just to summarize if you \nwant to join any of the meetups that we \nhave like like I said at the beginning \nwe are in Amsterdam we're in New York \nwe're in Boston we're in Toronto and San \nFrancisco and specifically in the next \ncouple of weeks we will be in Boston \nToronto so definitely join us there \num if you're a student and you want or \nyou want to contribute to vv8 we are \nkicking off Google summer of cold uh the \nlinks are in the description so you \nshould definitely do that if you're \ninterested in the new pipe operator is \nit an operator well we can figure out \nthe new pipe API \num there's a GitHub issue go read and \nsee what others are saying provide \nfeedback give us your ideas because we \nwant to work on all of it in in the open \nand then any feedback will make it just \nbetter Dan shared with you as well for \nhow we work on our search capabilities \nthat we will use for the documentation \nso that you should be able to search \nthroughout docs through our blogs and \nthrough the podcast that Connor is \ncurrently transcribing so this should be \npretty awesome and of course like the \nthe thing uh the cherry on top of the \ncake like with the generative module \nlike we're so super proud and as you \ncould see it's pretty amazing and um and \nit works really really well well there's \na little caveat you need to get your \nsyntax right and your brackets right uh \nbut once you have the syntax right \neverything works just perfectly \num so yeah that was uh that was it's \nbeen a pleasure and uh thank you all for \nlistening thank you team for joining and \nhave a great day evening morning thanks \neverybody thank you very much see you \nsoon bye bye \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Air \u2013 Episode #5", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_yfl4jIXFQ",
