{"text": "Thank you so much for watching the 23rd episode of the Weaviate Podcast! This episode dives into a new technique for ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nchecking out the wva podcast today i'm \nhere with ori rahm the lead author of \nlearning to retrieve passages without \nsupervision i think this is such an \nexciting paper about self-supervised \nlearning particularly for training these \nretrieval models and retribution \nretrieval models again with wva this is \nwhat we use to produce the embeddings of \nsay text data particularly for this \npaper that we use to retrieve to find \nthe nearest neighbor with our query and \nthis new work is a super exciting way to \ntrain these models self-supervised \nmeaning that we don't need to \nlabel data and this can work with just \nsay you know wikipedia or archive or you \njust \ndrop in a huge text corpus and it can \nbootstrap a loss function to optimize a \ndeep learning model to produce high \nquality representations of data so \nenough of that for me ori can you \nexplain what's new about this paper and \nthe ideas behind spider recurring span \nretrieval and all these cool ideas \nyeah sure so uh first thanks for \ninviting me i'm super excited to be here \num yeah so regarding spider \nso \nrecently we released my colleagues and i \nfrom tel aviv university \nwe released a paper on \nunsupervised \nlearning of dance retrieval \nand basically the main idea of our \ntraining system is to use the notion of \nrecurring spans which are engrams that \nappear more than once in a given context \nor in a given document for example on \nwikipedia \num to uh to construct pseudo examples \nfor uh for contrastive learning but in a \ntotally unsupervised fashion \num \nand uh yeah actually we were uh \ni guess we'll talk about it but yeah we \nwere quite surprised by how far we can \nget uh dance requires like how good can \nthey be without using any label examples \nduring training at all \num and yeah that's that's spider \nbasically um yeah \nso can you \nso \nwithout kind of getting too much into \nthe whole research story i really want \nto hear about your perspective around \nself-supervised retrieval models just so \nwe can kind of \nstay on that topic a little more compare \nit with say supervisor retrieval models \nagain the overlapping engrams \nyeah sure so um you know for the \nperspective side uh in the perspective \nside story um \nso i think that when we started this \nproject um there were mainly \neither supervisor recruiters in the \ndense side of the retrieval \nand obviously unsupervised ones in the \nmore lexical spar side of uh retrieval \nand yeah uh \nsupervisor troopers were ma were really \ngood for the \nfor their data set the data said they \nwere trained on \nbut they \nbut they started i mean \nuh \nwe started to observe and papers started \nto come out and show that they're \nactually not that good for out of \ndistribution \nand uh you know even in the same corpus \nbut other types of questions uh then \nthey fail quite uh \nquite miserably i'd say um and our \nintuition was that if we can uh \nif we can come up with a good signal for \nself-supervised retrieval uh then maybe \nwe we will not overfit to specific \ndistributions of questions and corpora \nand all that and and be able to be more \nrobust and and \nyeah so \ni think that actually like during the \nproject we we did \nobserve this \ni mean we did confirm this hypothesis \ni'd say that \num i mean \nwe'll jump to the results i guess uh \nlater but \num spider for example is better than dpr \nuh in the you know in the zero shot \nsetting without seeing any examples at \nall uh \neven you know in very close settings to \nwhere dpr was trained on for example if \nit was trained on natural questions and \nyou evaluate it against trivia qa then \nin this setting spider \nan off-the-shelf retriever that didn't \nobserve any uh um labeled example during \nits training is just better so um \nyeah so that's i think uh um \nthat's a hypothesis that we confirmed \nand and also other papers like parallel \nuh \nto us i also showed very similar \nuh observations and um \nanother uh \nand and from another uh perspective uh \nthey're also these pre-training methods \nare also very crucial for the success of \nthe um \nalso in the supervised setting so for \nexample if you take a \nspider and fine tune it you know to uh \nto specific data sets then you would \njust get uh better models for this data \nset and better \ntransferable models that better transfer \nto other data sets as well \nso um \nyeah so we were really excited by this \nuh you know by this direction and we \nstill believe \n[Music] \na great believers i'd say \nyeah i think um so so from my \nunderstanding of the experiments we're \ntraining on wikipedia \nand we have these different question \nanswering data sets so say we have \nnatural questions trivia qa web \nquestions \nthese are mostly question answering data \nsets derived from wikipedia is that \ncorrect yeah yeah \nso dense passage retrieval which is the \nsupervised learning baseline \nis trained on say labeled open domain \nquestion answering data sets so \nbasically what the way that this works \nis the the data labeler will receive \nsome context like say it's a paragraph \nfrom the wikipedia article about oxygen \nand they'll \nthey'll come up with a question and an \nanswer from that context \nand then the information retrieval task \nthen becomes given the question can you \nretrieve that context so that's the \ntraining data for the supervised \nbaseline \nso \nit sounds like the spider models trained \non wikipedia with the self-supervised \nlearning task are able to outperform \nin in the same uh \ndata distribution sort of if like so dpr \nhas the train test split and dpr trains \non this train set of questions this test \nsaid they're both being evaluated on \nthat same test set yeah \nso \ni feel like that's a huge result \nespecially because you can \nkeep going with the data \nwith spider right like yeah yeah \nyeah yeah exactly \nso spider doesn't outperform dpr on the \nsame data set that was trained on but it \ndoes beat it quite consistently in other \ndata sets over the same corpus yeah so \nyeah \nyeah \nand i think that's just absolutely \nremarkable and um i think quickly before \ngoing a little more into say the spider \nalgorithm recurring spanner treatment \nwe're going to talk about the query \ntransformation how this mimics bm25 \nlexical as well as this kind of \nuh you know neural network style fuzzy \nmatching but uh yeah i kind of \nand i've lost my training thought a \nlittle bit i don't remember all these \ntopics but i want to talk a little more \nabout the the scaling of data \nbecause it's self-supervised so it's \nlike you know we can we can grab a bunch \na bunch of more data so \ngoing from wikipedia to say archive or \nout of legal contracts like yeah or just \nweb scripts what happens as we scale \nthis algorithm \num that's a great question so actually i \nthink about it quite a lot um \nso we didn't uh try that on other \ncorpora mainly due to you know resources \nbecause we're in a university and all \nbut \num \ni believe that um it will \nwork on other um \ndomains as well especially on \non domains like \nnews \nand archive and stuff like that \num \nyeah i i i don't think that there's \nnothing uh uh very \nwe \nwikipedia-ish about uh this uh training \nparadigm \num except for the part that maybe \nperhaps wikipedia has like \nmore repetitive \nnature than maybe other domains but \num \ni don't think that that's the case for \nnews for example and \nmany domains that \nrequire retrieval \nespecially for open domain question \nanswering \nso \nuh yeah that's a great question and we \nmight um i mean we do think of uh \ngoing like on a larger scale and maybe \ntraining \nanother spider on more data \num \nbut i i don't have a concrete answer to \nyour uh to your question but i do \nbelieve that it will be pretty good \non other domains as well \nyeah \nyeah i can from kind of the vva \nperspective i'm so excited about how \nthis interface lets people say say you \nhave like a blog or \nlet's use the blog example and you have \nlike 100 articles \nand you want a specific retrieval model \nfor your blog and your specific language \ni love how these self-supervised \nlearning algorithms let you just you \nknow have a way to train it without \nlabeling the data without retrieving the \ncontext deriving questions and however \nlong that might take to get like a \nhundred thousand to push an answer \nyeah i think that would be a great time \nfor us to dive into how recurring span \nretrieval works so \nyeah \num \nokay i can i can tell you my head oh \nsorry \nyeah yeah \ngo ahead go ahead and ask your question \noh so i can tell you my my understanding \nof it so far is we look for these \noverlapping engrams within the same \narticle and so i think that's another \nreally interesting use of inherent \nstructure \nin these in say documents and that's the \nthing about self-supervised learning is \nyou're trying to \nexploit structure and labels that are \nalready kind of in the data so you take \nan article like oxygen and then you use \noverlapping engrams so say they share \nthe snippet uh atomic number is eight or \nyou know some engram like that and you \nuse that to form the positives and the \nnegative is some you know some pat some \npassage 100 word chunk that doesn't have \nthat engram \nand then there's a query transformation \nthat's applied so \n50 probability flip of a coin you either \ndelete the engram from the positive or \nyou keep it and that's kind of the idea \nbehind \nuh having this sort of like fuzzy \nreference where you're saying \nuh i don't know who was \nblank \nlike kind of referring to it in that \nkind of way so uh is that \nyeah exactly um yeah just one uh one \nminor \ni mean you describe it really well but \nuh the \num the masking that the deletion of the \nspan is is not from the positive passage \nbut rather than uh \nin the queer \nthe passages remain the same \nthroughout our training \nand yeah the yeah the idea behind this \nmasking is that you want to be able to \nmodel both lexical overlap which \nuh which is encouraged in the case where \nthis uh engram does appear in the query \nand also appears in \nthe positive passage and then we can say \nokay there's a term overlap between the \nquery and the passage uh but when you \nmask the when you delete this span from \nthe query um \nthe \npre-training test becomes more semantic \nin a way and more about the context of \nthe of the query and \nuh yeah in a way we try to you know to \nmodel both this these complementary \nskills um \nthat you know uh um \none is uh attributed uh to dense \nrecruiters and one is more attributed to \nsparse retrievers but eventually i \nbelieve that we want all of them to be \njust like in a single vector or maybe \nmultiple vectors but in one model that \nis able to model \nuh this interaction both in a semantic \nway and in a lexical way between the \nquery and the \ncorpus \nso that's what we try to to model \nand the query transformation is mainly \nit is \nboth about this and about um being more \nsimilar in distribution to questions or \nto queries of \nsearch engines or whatever \nbecause we don't want it to look like a \npassage like a long test if we want it \nto look like a \nrelatively small window short window uh \nso we can control we basically control \nhow long is the query we sample it from \nour uniform distribution between i think \n5 and 30 tokens around the recurring \nspan and then we just randomly either \ndelete it or keep it in the query \nso yeah but the passages both the \npositive one and the negative one they \nremain the same throughout training \nso one more and a lot of ideas in that i \ncan't wait to get back into say \nhybrid retrieval where we combine bm25 \nas well as dense retrieval models and \nget into that discussion one vector to \nrule them all compared to the multi \nvectors and nothing but i one more kind \nof detail to the algorithm i wanted to \nget behind is the span filtering so when \nyou do the overlapping engrams you \nprobably get a lot of like uh you know \nas the \nis \nright like conjunction or \nyou know like phrases that don't have \nany real meaning and thus positives they \nwould be useless so how do you you know \nprocess all the engrams yeah totally so \nyeah that's a great question um \nso we did want uh to to filter out spans \nthat we don't think that uh bear any \nmeaning \num and but on the other side we didn't \nwant this \nthis filtering to be like a model \ndependent you know because many works uh \nuh \nthat used salience fans in in all sorts \nof ways they mainly used they mainly did \nsomething like you know named entity \nrecognition or something like that and \nthen they took the the entities \nuh and and treated them as aliens fans \nbut we wanted something that is uh \ntotally unsupervised doesn't depend on a \ntrained model in any way \nand \nthus are filtering included uh first uh \nremoving any engram that is um \nthat it only uh \nincludes stop words so for example your \nexample with as the and all these words \nthey they don't cut they don't uh \ncontribute to the um to this uh \nengram uh \nuh process \nand uh we didn't take any engrams that \nany any unigrams uh \nuh but \nwith that \nuh we \nlooked only on spans that are uh two \nthat are by grams or longer than that \num and i think that's it maybe we had \nsome more filters i i don't recall but \num these were the the main ones um \nbecause as you say i mean you can \neasily get with like uh \nof the \nuh in them \nand they will dominate the whole \ndistribution of your uh stands and \nthat's not what we want to achieve \num so yeah but i do think that \nuh \nfurther that \nwe can further improve these uh filters \nand and you know have and be more \nprecision oriented maybe then recall \noriented that that's a trade-off that \nthat is really \nimportant and interesting to to explore \nbut um \nwe kind of stick to our \ninitial filters and and kind of uh \nuh \nused them in a they were constant uh \nthroughout our research \nso yeah \ncan we get a little i want to get a \nlittle more details about these salient \nspan masking how does that so you have \nanother model that classifies some \nsalient span that would be useful for \npositive what would be the thinking \naround that kind of algorithm \nyeah so maybe like in a general way \nsalient span masking is used for example \nuh for training t5 for \nclose book open domain question \nanswering and \nbut not in the context of uh recurring \nstands \nso these are kind of orthogonal things \nright i mean recurring spans are in a \nway \nuh \nlike a self-supervised way to obtain \nsalient spins i'd say \num so \nin the context of spider for example uh \nyou could think of uh of a process that \nuh you know \nlooks only on the \noverlap of some salient span from a \nnamed entity \nrecognizer for example and \nits overlap with recurring stands and \nonly taking those as like a higher \nquality \nset of \nspans \nand be more precision oriented in that \nmanner than reoriented but \nand \nit may even improve i i'm not sure \nbecause \nlike any other self-supervised method it \nis very noisy but you know you use large \nbatches and \nand in a very long \ntraining process and \nyou just uh you hope that you know the \nthe signal to noise ratios is just uh \nyou know \nthat it's uh that it's good enough and \nin our case i believe it was good enough \nbut but then again \nuh uh \nmaybe you can improve it even more and \ndue to the fact that it's \nself-supervised and you can do it like \non very large corpora \nbeing precision oriented doesn't \nnecessarily \num \nhurt you in any way maybe you can just \nlook at what on a larger scale of data \nand be and be very picky on what on what \nspans you take from it \nuh and you can still train for very long \nand very large batches and \nmaybe your signal would be \neven better \nreally interesting so the \nceiling span masking idea is like when \nwe're picking that token we're going to \nmask out or even we're masking out a \nwhole span in models like t5 you don't \njust replace a single mass token you \nhave like five words that it's gonna \nyou know decode so you so you try to \nfind the phrase that would be you know \nthe most information dense and almost \nsounds like an active learning kind of \nway where it's like what would be the \nmost \neffective next training update yeah \nthat's so interesting how the \nself-supervised \nuh overlapping engrams can bootstrap \nwhat's the most selling thing so i'm so \nexcited to get into the training details \ncould we could we start with \nuh you use the info nce loss right where \nyou have the \nbatch of negatives \ncould we start with comparing info nce \nwith say triplet loss \nyeah sure \nso um \nyeah so we were kind of inspired by the \ndpr framework uh in our uh \nin our training uh so what they did is \nsimply take \nthey took \nlarge batches \nof \nquestions \nand each question had \nits positive passage which is labeled \nand the hard negative passage which came \nfrom a \nhigh-ranked bm25 passage \nuh which doesn't contain the answer \nand then \nbasically their training looks like for \neach question you have like a \nmulti-class classification problem \nwhich \ntakes these two passages and all the \nother passages of the other questions in \nthe batch \nand \ntry to optimize \nthe model such that the representation \nof the question will be similar in uh in \nthe dot product sense \nto the positive testage and \nand far away from all the other \nall the other \npathogen beddings \nso \nthat's uh i mean this this framework was \nkind of \nreused in many \nsettings in machine learning and some \ncall it as you call it uh influenzae \nsome call it uh the contrastive loss \ntoday because \n[Music] \nuh you know uh i guess uh since the \nsimclear paper or or \nsomething \num \nso \nyeah and and that's and that's very \nnatural because in deep learning we we \nuse the cross entropy loss all the time \nand this contrastive loss is basically \njust \ncross entropy \nsuch that you know every question \ndefines a multi-class classification \nproblem \nwhich if you could you you would want to \ndo over the whole corpus but you can't \nbecause it's too costly so you just \nestimate \nthe partition function from the \nfrom a sample of \nnegatives \nfrom the batch and this hard negative \nthat you um \nthat you bring uh uh you know um the \nspecific uh uh hard negative uh tries to \num \nto be like the \nlike like it's called the harder uh \nlike making your task harder um \nbecause if you just sample from the \ncorpus then you uh basically \nthe test can get uh too easy and we also \nobserved it in the paper we have \nablations on that uh in the paper and \nthey have it in the dpr form of as well \num \nso yeah uh in comparison with the \ntriplet loss so i think that it's just \nmore natural in deep learning to use the \nsomething like the cross entropy and \ncontrastive loss so people use it more \noften and we didn't compare these two \nbecause we just you know um \nwe didn't try to apply \nthe objectives \nbut i do believe that uh they'll \nprobably work better than the triplet \nlosses uh but i i'm saying it only \nbecause that's you know the common \nwisdom of deep learning i guess \nand yeah so taking from so so this is \nthe dpr framework and we wanted to and \nit and it was very um \nuh very effective \nso we try to think uh can we take this \nframework and replace those uh \nquestion passage pairs which which are \nexpensive to collect \nand are \nvery \nhard to collect in many domains and many \nscenarios \nand can we replace them with pseudo \nexamples \nand \nand indeed our \npre-training scheme looks very similar \nto dpr in that sense where uh as we \ndiscussed before we have uh this uh \npseudo query uh which replaces the dpr \nquestion and we have this positive \npassage which replaces the positive the \ndpr positive passage \nand our hard negative is \nuh doesn't um we didn't uh fetch it \nusing pm25 or something it's just from \nthe same document and due to the fact \nthat it's from the same document as the \npositive passage it makes the task a lot \nharder and a lot more semantic in a way \nwhere \nlexical \nclues on their own can't get you that \nfar \nin terms of \ndiscriminating between these two so uh \nyeah i think in table four in our paper \nwe show that removing the hard negative \npassage from the document \nand from the batch \nresults in a in a much \nin a in a high \nsignificant drop in performance \nat least in the zero shot setting i'm \nnot sure about the fine tuning setting \nbut in this in the zero shot setting \nit's pretty significant it can get to \nlike \ni think 6.7 points of uh recall k which \nis pretty \nuh significant so \nthe presence of power negatives is \nextremely important for this contrastive \nlearning framework both in the \nsupervised setting and in a unsupervised \n[Music] \nyeah i think the hard negative is so \ninteresting the the use of the inherent \nstructure in the documents compared to \nthese other kind of things where you \nknow say the the positives are \noverlapping engrams and then the \nnegative the negatives are just from \nother articles so it's like totally \nirrelevant it would be like two passages \nabout \noxygen and then it's like lebron james \nyeah eiffel tower \nwithout that structure yeah so so you \nwill get something out of it but um this \nuh \nfine-tuning uh hard negative is \nso important for the semantics of all \nthe of the model yeah \nthat kind of like reasoning \ni \nhad one more like \nkind of just nitpicking my understanding \nof \ninfo nce multi-class \nso \nto me what makes it not multi-class is \nyou have to \nyou do that like batch matrix multiple \nwhere you have all the dot products \nright so you have this big matrix \nthat has all the uh \ni'm trying to do but you have all the \ndot product scores of everything in the \nbatch yeah so then my question is so \nwhen you have this big matrix and \nin the paper you describe eight gpus \nscaling that out with the horizontally \nwith the gpus how does that work how do \nyou distribute this big batch matrix \nmultiplication that then gets compressed \nthen to multi-class classification oh \nyeah so \nyeah so the so the scaling part the the \ndistributed part is mainly in the \ntransformer part of it so um so we're \ndoing like a distributed data parallel \ntraining where uh you have the same you \nhave the your \nyour model copied around uh \nacross these eight gpus \nand then \nyou \ndivide the the batch to like eight parts \nand \nand uh \nboth the questions and the \npassages are divided to these gpus and \nthen the transformers \nare \nin parallel they um \nthey compute the you know the \nrepresentations and all and then the \nhorror present \nall of the representations are gathered \nto the same gpu to gpu 0 \nand then \nthis \nmatrix multiplication happens only once \nin one gpu but it's very um \nit's very cheap compared to the \nto the transformers encoding your inputs \nso that's not such a big deal \nand it the matrix is uh something like \nit's actually \nits size is like your batch size \ntimes uh twice the bedside because each \nuh \neach question has both uh like \na positive and a hard negative one so in \nour case it's like 1000 \nover 2 000 so it's not such a \nsuch a big matrix \nand \nuh yeah from what i recall uh it's it's \nreally this step of multiplying the \nrepresentations is quite cheap compared \nto \n[Music] \nthe \ntransformers calculations \nso \nwhat goes into the the code with that \nwith \neight transformers in parallel sync up \nto one node to do the batch and then get \nthe loss and then send it back to each \nof the transformers how is the code what \nextra challenge comes with doing this \num \nso it's actually \nnot that i mean it's it's much simpler \nthan what it sounds i guess um \nso torch has you know it's \nuh it's uh distributed um \nuh framework and basically you have this \nuh gather operation where you just you \nsimply tell the gpus um \nfetch me \nplease fetch the this tensor from all \nthe gpus and i want it concatenated over \nsome dimension and then you just get and \nyou know the whole back pro and all that \nit's just \nimplemented for you and you don't need \nto even \num \nyou know to worry about it so \nuh yeah i guess it's much simpler than \nthan what it sounds and um \num \nyeah that's it i guess \nso from your expertise i'm really \ncurious to get your opinion on do you \nthink the abstractions implemented in \npytorch for \ndistributed training for this particular \nidea is is it enough that it's easy \nenough to use compared to say \nneeding some new model training software \nto say make you know more people able to \ndo this kind of training \num \nso i guess that uh \nlike there are many \npapers that implemented contrastive \nlearning in many ways for many \nfor many tasks for many scenarios \nso \num \ni think that you know the initial um \neffort that you need to put in order to \num to set up your own framework is is so \nuh \nyou know it's so small compared to even \nwhen where we were uh only like you know \nfour or five years ago \nwhere you needed to implement your \ntraining pipeline \nfrom scratch for any task that you \nwanted to \nwork on and today you have all these \ninfrastructures like \nhugging phase transformers and hugging \nface data sets and many others \nand everything became \nmuch easier than what it was \nnot so long ago so \nyeah so i believe that \nthe effort is is not very \num \nvery \nsignificant \nand one of the so i'm really amazed by \nsay the google collab gpu everyone's got \na gpu now \none gpu though yeah could these models \nbe fine i know the the fine tuning \nexperiments happen with say eight rtx's \ncompared to eight a100s could people \nfine-tune these models for their data \nsets with one gpu yeah um that's a great \nquestion uh i think the answer is \nabsolutely yes um \nso for example in our fine tuning \nexperiments i'm not sure if we mention \nit in the paper we used only \ntwo \nquadro rdx gpus \nso \neven if you have only one you can lower \nthe batch size \nworst case you can do some trick like \nmaybe gradient checkpointing or \nsomething like that and maybe the \ntraining would be a bit longer but \nyou'll get the same effect \nor just \nuh or just \ndecrease the batch size and \nin the supervised setting it's not that \nuh \ncrucial what is the batch size that you \nuse it very far correctly in the dpr \npapers it's really a \nminor \nimprovement from like 32 questions to \n128 \num so to your question definitely you \ncan fine-tune such models on \non \na single gpu and also there are other \ntricks for example like just do weight \nsharing um from the question to the \npassage use the same weight in the \nquestion and passage encoder that this \nwill um \nthis will the model will be two times \nsmaller but the results are are \npretty much the same \nand um \nyeah so i think fine tuning is is really \nuh efficient and very cheap compared to \npre-training where we had to use \n8 \n800 gpus which are pretty \nexpensive \nand other papers like the contributor \nfor example also used uh you know \nthey used i think \neven more gpus i don't remember exactly \nhow many but \nduring pre-training the um \nthe size of the batch is much more \nuh has much more impact than at fine \ntuning time \nso \nuh \nso in terms of fine tuning you don't \nhave to worry about the gpus but \nat pre-training i'd say that it's \nit's a lot more important to have \nthis \nlarge scale both in terms of the data \nand in terms of the compute \num yeah and but perhaps a way to \novercome this issue is \nthrough something like moco or something \nlike use a memory bank of passages \nand um \njust have like um \nkind of like an artificial \nuh batch in a way \nthat's how i think of it and that's a \nlot more \na lot cheaper than just \ncalculating the batch um \neach time \nso \nyeah that's that's also another option \nto how to like um \ndecrease the \nthe compute that you \nthat you use and probably get the same \nresults i believe \nyeah it's super interesting and \ni suppose one detail on the fine-tuning \nthing is i'm imagining you know wev8 \nusers who are using the vva search \nengine for say their specific text and \ntheir blogs \ndo you see say for them \nuse spyder as an off-the-shelf model \nsimilar to how we're using a lot of \nthese mini lms in the sentence \ntransformer library \njust kind of you know using that in the \nzero shot and then so if we think about \nfine tuning \nshould they fine tune with the engrams \nthe recurring span retrieval idea \nor should they just you know make their \nown little question answering data set \nusing the labeling scheme we described \nwhere you you know pop up a context \nderive a question derive an answer and \nwhat would be the best way for \nthat's a great question um \nso if they \nif their corpus is wikipedia then i \ndefinitely say just take spider off the \nshow \nmake sure that the format of the \npassages uh is \nexactly as \nas it was during the free training of \nspider which is 100 words \nand you'll definitely be okay and you'll \nhave a pretty good retriever and maybe \neven use a hybrid retriever over \nuh like take a spider and vm 25 and \nyou'll get a retriever which is better \nthan both of them \nif you have the ability to even annotate \nuh \nas few as i don't know hundred examples \nthen you probably get uh a significant \nboost in in the results um \nspecifically for the \nfor the distribution \nof your annotation uh \nexample of your annotated examples \num \nyeah so i think that's the \nthat's the best recipe if you have \nanother corpus if if you're not uh uh \nusing wikipedia as your purpose then i \nwould say that you can take spider and \njust fine tune it with repairing spanner \npeople on your specific uh corpus \nand um \nmake sure that your passages during \npre-training are just formatted as uh \nspecific \nexactly like you intend to use them uh \nat inference time and if that's the case \nthen i believe that uh it will be a \nreally effective way to get a good \nretriever to your domain and \nand again another boost will \nprobably be \nobtainable by uh \nby using a hybrid approach with 1.5 \nyeah so now i want to dive into the \nhybrid quickly i do want to see say that \nyeah that query transformation id is \nreally clever how you you know the \nwindow length makes it more like a query \nwith search engines and i think that \nwhole thing is super interesting idea \nbut so can we talk about how we combine \nspider with bm25 what's the idea behind \nhybrid retrieval \nsure so i think okay so uh first we're \nnot the first \nto show that using both of these \nof these models together \nresult in in a better model that \nimproves over both of them quite \nconsistently \nso i think a few months before our paper \nwas um \na paper by uh uh \nsome authors from uh university of uh uh \num \n[Music] \nactually i'm not sure where they're from \ni think maybe waterloo but i'm not sure \nuh the jimmy liens left \nuh so um \nso they showed uh this uh phenomenon for \ndpr \nand they showed that when you use it uh \nin a \nin a specific way you get uh \nyou get an improvement over dpr \nin contrast to what the dpr paper showed \nwhere they uh where the hybrid model was \nuh \nwas \nsub-optimal compared to dpr itself \num \nso but the only difference was that um \nthey use the hyper parameter that scales \nthe scores of bm25 and \ndpr and they find and they \nand they \nperform hyperparameter tuning for this \nhyper parameter on the deficit but in \nour case we didn't want to do that \nbecause uh we wanted to be in a zero \nshot setting where you don't assume you \nhave any labeled examples so we just uh \nuh so we decided to uh assign this uh \nhyper parameter to \nthe the value one and and uh that means \nthat you basically sum \nuh some of the scores of \nspider and bm25 and uh their sum is now \nyour hybrid model score \nand this approach uh \nis very uh is very effective turns out \nand it improves over both of them \nconsistently and quite significantly so \ni'd say that if you have a retriever \nover your own domain \num \nbe sure to to use both of them if you \nwant if you want to be if you if you \ncare about your retriever be to be as \ngood as you can \nthen i definitely say use both of them \nand if you can annotate some examples of \nyour own then it would even get better \nand then again use it in a hybrid \nfashion with bm25 and that's basically \nthe best model uh that you can get today \nso i have a couple questions about how \nthis works and first i want to get into \nso we we're just going to sum the bm25 \nscore with the uh with the dot product \nor l2 distance cosine similarity from \nour dense model \nis there any maybe normalization of the \nscores that should go into this i also \nsaw a devil in the details in the paper \nthat say say a passage wasn't in either \nof the um bm25 or let's just say a dense \nyou know i'm sure you know \nyeah yeah you just \nyeah that's an important detail so what \nwe did is uh and we took it also from \ntheir paper \nis that obviously the set the top k uh \nretrieved results of both retrievers \nwon't be the same \nso one approach you can take is simply \nrecalculate \nthe score \nfor uh \nfor the second retriever for for example \nif you have a passage that came from vm \n25 and was it in the dpr set or spider \nset you can \neither explicitly calculate its score \nits dpr score but then you need to \num \nyou need to \nto feed it to the to dpr and all \nso instead of that we just used a very \nsimple trick \nuh in which you just take the uh in the \nexample that i just gave for \nthat you have a bm25 passage \num but it wasn't in the spider score in \nthe spider set sorry then you just take \nthe lowest uh set the lowest score in \nthe spider set from the top k review \nresults and you and you just assign this \npassage \nuh it's its spider score will be now \nthis lowest score and that that's just \ngood enough you don't you don't need to \ndo any more than that \nbut \num \nit would be important to \nto test whether \nexplicitly rescoring these \ncandidates \nwill \nwill result in a better \nin a better ranking \ni'm not sure about it but \nit does require some more effort so \nthis simple approach that i just \ndescribed is is quite effective \nso \nso sort of the in you know maybe tabular \ndata pre-processing for machine learning \nwe do this min max scaling with each of \nthe features because they have different \nranges so \nyou know that kind of x minus x max \ndivided by x min something like that to \nkeep it on zero one for the dead scores \nand the bm 25 scores that kind of \nnormalization of the values of these \nthings before we then have that linear \naddition without the you know useful \num that's uh that's a great idea i'm \nsure we didn't think of it um \nyeah maybe \nit can work maybe even better than what \nwe did \nwe didn't try it but \nyou do need to \ni mean \nbm25 has \nthis property that it's um its scores \nare length dependent right uh \nas the query is longer and the passage \nis longer you will probably get higher \nscores \nwhile in dpr this is not the case you \nwill \nalways have pretty much the same \nuh the same scores because you just \nyou have these vectors in the same space \nand just multiply them and \nthey don't really depend on the length \nof your query or length of your passage \nso \num \nbasically you will need to think how you \num \nhow you normalize it in a way that is \nrobust across different lengths of the \nquery \nand \nthat will work both for short queries \nand for long queries \nbut uh i guess that it's somehow \nsolvable i believe \nyeah that that the the query passage \nlength i do that's such an interesting \ndetail with how the bm25 works i've seen \nsome variants like you know bm25 plus \nthere's like little different ways of \nkicking this work can i and well quickly \ncan i ask about the reciprocal rank \nfusion idea where we combine the scores \nnot uh combine the ranks from bm25 and \ndpr or dens retrieval not by the scores \nbut by the ranks \nsorry can you repeat the question \nah sorry so so instead of doing a linear \ncombination of the scores bm25s produced \nyou know spiders produce we might look \nat the just the ranks solely you know \nyeah \num yeah that's also an \ninteresting idea \nwe didn't try that but it may \nit may be very \nvery effective i believe um \ni'm not sure how exactly like uh uh \nyou would do that maybe as you said with \ntheir proton rank or something \nbut um \nyeah i mean that sounds like a very nice \nidea to \nto check out yeah \num \nyeah \nlike how \nbetter \nuh \ni mean it's really interesting to to uh \nto do some sanity check of like how uh \nbetter can you get like \nhow \nmuch of the \nyou know the union of the two sets are \nyou able to \num to squeeze into the top k that \nactually is interesting for you uh \ngiven that you don't \nfor example in open domain question \nanswering you want the top 100 or top 50 \nor top 20 to be \nas good as possible and don't really \ncare about the ranking inside them \nthat's \noften the case \nso it's really interesting to check out \nwhether \nhow much room can you like uh given that \nyou \nuh fixed the retrieved set from bm25 and \nuh and dpr \nuh \nuh how \nlike \nuh how many of the um \nlike how often does it happen that you \nhave some good passages that are left \nout in the um when you do linear \ncombination and are left out \nin the \noutside the top 20 and then you you \nunderstand whether you have \nwhether you want to improve \nthe combination or the hybrid model in a \nway like you described \nbut \ni'm not sure whether there's a lot of \nroom to improve in that \naspect \nyeah i think the \ni think it can \nmaybe like yeah like as we design these \npipelines maybe you're doing \nwell the idea that you've just presented \nsay we want to have some diversity in \nthe result it's not necessarily about \nmake the number let's get the number one \nthing to be the most accurate thing we \nwant to have some diversity if it's say \ngetting pipelined into a question \nanswering model so \nso i guess that kind of changes the \ndownstream application case changes a \nbit how you want to \nuh \ncom combine ranks you know is it a \nsearch application in which i want to \ngive you the absolute best thing number \none then yeah let's optimize it like \ncrazy whereas if it's qa you might want \nautomated qa2 you might want to \nyeah it's only relationship i totally \nagree it's it's really \nuh application dependent \nand that's why i believe that in in many \num \nsearch scenarios \nyou you want you want to like uh to run \nacross encoder or re-ranker in order to \nto get the the best result in number one \nor number two and not in the top 20. \nlike \nlike the open domain case where you \ndon't really mi you don't really care \nabout the ranking inside the top 20 or \n200 \num \nso that's what that's something that a \ncross encoder uh or a re-ranker uh can \ncan get you like uh uh \ncan is still much stronger than just a \nsimple retriever \nso \nso so that's normal \nso that's another reason why you can \nclaim that it's not that important to \noptimize for \nfor the top one of the retriever because \nif you \num if you intend to run a re-ranker and \nin in any case then you don't really \ncare about the ranking of its like the \ninitial ranking of its uh inputs \nright \nyeah the cross encoder is potent that \nthing \nbut it's expensive to do a bunch of \npairwise classifications so we \nwant to try to reduce that so on the \nsubject of efficiency uh \nwhat goes like at wva we're super i like \nat least me personally i'm super aware \nof this h sw vector index structure for \ndoing the retrieval and find the nearest \nneighbor with the retrieval i'm kind of \ncurious with bm25 how do how do you have \nefficient search or is it's just a \nscoring metric could you tell me a \nlittle bit more about the speed of \ncomputing bm25 scores between query and \nthen \nmassive collection \nyeah that that's a great question so we \nkind of used uh \nuh pi sirini of the show for bm25 \nand from what i \nobserved it seemed like it's a bit \nslower than dense retrieval \nbut \ni'm not an expert to you know the \nefficiency um \nto the efficiency aspects of dance \nretrieval versus sparse retrieval i know \nthat many people \num \ni guess have like different opinions \nabout that uh topic and in dance \nretrieval you also have um you can \npretty much control the the efficiency \nof your um \nuh of your index by uh like in the \nso hnsw can uh \num like you can do like a more course \ngrade search or you can do exact search \nor you can do \nuh you can do all sorts of things and \nobviously doing exact search is is a bit \nuh \nis a bit slower but it's not that uh \nit's not that bad i guess like over \nwikipedia it takes \ni think something like um \nuh \nsome hundreds of milliseconds uh for one \nquery \nbut then if you do uh an approximate \nsearch then you will get like uh just \nthen it will be very very fast \nuh in terms of bm25 i'm not sure whether \npiscerini is like the most optimized \nlibrary because i think it's a bit more \nresearch \noriented than \nefficiency oriented \ni would want to say like uh i mean maybe \nmaybe not maybe i'm wrong but uh that's \nthat's how i see it \nso \nas far as i can tell and from what i \nremember it \nyou have like \nits \nis something like um \nsome dozens of queries per second \nsomething like that \num \nyeah but specifically our work we we \ndidn't try to optimize this aspect of \nquery efficiency because our you know \nour test sets are relatively small so we \ndidn't really care about that \nbut there are many scenarios where you \ndo care \nobviously like if you want to \ni don't know do retrieval in a very \nlarge scale or \njust have like a very quick uh response \nto a user \nuh but then \ni'm not sure what what is the best way \nto go in that sense \nyeah i think \nman i'm not an expert on the bm25 how \nexactly i know that i think it has \nsomething to do with inverted index i \nknow there's things like elasticsearch \nthat have built up the you know really \nhow to do this efficiently and just \nhoping to get a little nugget and keep \ngetting my understanding of \nyeah efficiency on that uh i believe \nthat gpus can also accelerate the \ndance retrieval as well so we used cpus \nfor our dance retrieval system but um \nso we didn't try to use gpus for them \nbut \nuh i do think that i saw in some papers \nthat if you uh if you do \num store your index on gpus then you can \nget quite a boost and that makes sense \nand also maybe you can \npair uh you can do like multiple queries \nin in parallel and just um and then you \ncan scale it like on many gpus and and \nbasically get to the whatever \nperformance you want \num \nyeah i think i can comment on this \nquickly and then maybe you know eddie \nand or someone from wva can clarify this \nis correct but with \nwith hnsw we have a hierarchy graph \nwhere you're it's connected based on \nthis it's a proximity graph that is \nlayered \nso the gpu idea is you want to do a \nbunch of vector calculations at once so \nwe can trip so we can \ntraverse a big set of nodes in the graph \nthis visualization is doing it for \npeople but you know \nthat's how that idea of i think gpu \naccelerated distance calculation also \nplays with the hierarchical structure of \nthe nation sw proximity graph but um so \nall right thanks so much for these \ntechnical details i think this is you \nknow such interesting so many \ninteresting details to this could maybe \nstep outside and could you describe to \nme sort of the meta around your research \ncareer \nputting this project together sort of \nyour plans future work that whole kind \nof thing \nuh yeah sure um \nyeah so i think \nthat this work connects to to some other \npapers that i um \nthat i work \ni was part of sorry um i think i'm \nuh \nthat i'm super excited by uh by \nunsupervised learning and \nself-supervised learning and future \nlearning and basically learning from \nvery few examples \nor not at all no examples at all \nand \nyeah i don't like to work on supervised \ntasks that much \nbecause \nit's it's \ntoo often you get very minor \nimprovements from modeling \n[Music] \num changes \nand \nin the self-supervised uh setting or \nflue shot setting \nthen everything is amplified and um you \ncan really see \nthe signal \nmuch clearer and in a much more \num \nyeah in a much more amplified way \nuh and that that's uh and that's why i \nreally like it um and also there's i \nthink there's more room to like \ncreative ideas and how to use the \nstructure like you said before the \nstructure of language structure of \nimages i don't know structure of \nwhatever domain you're working on and \nrather than just fitting your data into \nuh into a model in a supervised way \nwhich is \nokay but uh \num \nthinking of uh of what is the specific \naspects of your task of your task that \nthat you can leverage \nin a in an unsupervised way or in a \nself-supervised way uh really excites me \npersonally um \nand i'd say that \nrather than that i also \ni'm really excited as as we all by \nlanguage models and large language mods \nand whatever you can do with them which \nis quite a lot um \nuh so \nand now i'm super excited by the \ni'd say \nintersection of language models with \nretrieval and with dance representations \nand there's like a bunch of new work on \nhow you do use large language models in \norder to rank or in order to \nproduce good representations \nand it's uh it's very exciting and \nthis whole direction of generative \nretrieval and stuff like that and it \nmakes uh and it really makes sense \nbecause we now have very powerful \ngenerated models \nthat we can use \nand \num the question of how to use them \nfor your task is \nvery similar to what i said before like \nhow do you \nhow do you take advantage of the \nspecific aspects of your task \nuh in a way that language models can \ncan contribute to so \ni'd say that the intersection of \nuh unsupervised learning future learning \nretrieval and language models is \nbasically what i \nuh what i'm most excited about \nawesome that's so exciting and well \nreally quick i just want to get a little \nmore on the on on how you see retrieval \nand language models \nyeah this a little more \nso do you see putting these large \nlanguage models \nin the search pipeline so you know a few \nshot learning say we have a query intent \nclassifier you provide a few examples of \nuh the query is hey i'm looking for a \nshirt that would match these shoes so do \nyou want shoes to be returned that you'd \nsay like it's a compliment compared to \nsay a substitute or an exact search like \nqueer intent consultation \nand with the language models you could \nprovide a few demonstrations of this and \nthen the language model can make future \ninferences so \nit so are you thinking about it from the \nangle of you put the language models \ninto the search pipeline to enhance the \nsearch experience or \nthe sort of wreck deep mind retro \nretrieval augments of language model \ninference where the retrieval is like \nhere's the information you need and the \nlanguage bundle is like all right i can \njust generate anything uh well that's a \ngreat question i i'm a great believer of \nboth directions actually \num \nso i \ni do \ni do like um the retrieval language \nmodels \ndirection because i think that there's \nuh there's a limit to where you can get \nwhen you put the entire uh like your \nentire uh \num \nyou trust only the parameters of your \nmodel \nand indeed you get to i don't know 200 \nbillion parameters but i'm not sure that \nwe need to get there uh if if we use our \ndata more \ncorrectly and that \nincludes retrieving \nthe relevant stuff to what you want to \ndo and just \nhave your model \nbe conditioned on this relevant \ninformation and then on the the other \ndirection that you said is also very \nuh exciting in my opinion and it's how \nyou do like uh the opposite right how \nyou use language models to improve a \nretrieval and \ni do think that it's um it's very \npromising but i'm not sure that it \nshould be \nwithin the pipeline \nrather than \nuse it as \na supervision to train for example \ndancer quivers \nlike um \nlike recent work from facebook where \nthey use the uh the re-ranking of t0 to \nsupervise um \nto supervise uh \nactually it's unsuper it's an \nunsupervised model uh which uh \nyeah which \nand and it's only in a zero-shot manner \nso \nyeah i do think that we have so much \nknowledge in language models and and \nlike \ndistilling it into retrievers \ni think \npersonally i think it's the future \num \nand uh \nyeah so so both directions that \nyou mentioned i think that they're very \nuh promising and i believe that they're \nthe future of language models and the \nfuture of retrieval and that they'll be \nuh \nlike interleaved \nyeah \nsuper interesting ori thank you so much \nfor coming on the web podcast is i \nlearned so much from this conversation i \nreally enjoyed it and thank you so much \nthanks for inviting me connor \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Ori Ram on Learning
