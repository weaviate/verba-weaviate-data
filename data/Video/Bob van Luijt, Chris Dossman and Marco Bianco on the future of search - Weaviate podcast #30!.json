{"text": "Thank you so much for watching the 30th episode of the Weaviate podcast! ChatGPT has landed, leaving a massive impact on the ... \nforeign \n[Music] \n's chat gbt is an incredible \nbreakthrough in artificial intelligence \nchat gbt has inspired many people to \nwonder about the future of search \nengines the latest weba podcast features \npeople at The Cutting Edge of large \nlanguage models and search technology \ntogether today we host semi-technology \nCEO Bob Van light and facts co-founders \nChris dossman and Marco Bianco \nuh so thank you so much for joining the \nweba podcast \nthanks for having us yeah thank you \nit's like we maybe kicked this off uh \nMarco and Chris could you tell us about \nuh what you're building sure well facts \nwas uh born from a bad experience I had \nliving in Southern California where me \nand my uh wife and two young children at \nthe time had to evacuate because of \nwildfires \num and when trying to figure out uh what \nalerts to sign up for what uh Twitter \naccounts to follow or Facebook pages to \nfollow and uh it was all completely \ndisjointed very difficult to find that \ninformation \ntook me about two full days to feel like \nI really had you know coverage and \nunderstood uh what was going on and um \nso it was born out of need from that and \nrealizing man if it if it took me uh if \nit was this difficult for me most people \nare getting \nbest incomplete information and it works \nbad or no information so originally our \ngoal was to just crowdsource validate uh \nthese essential facts uh links phone \nnumbers uh things that people need in \nday-to-day life uh as and for you know \nemergency situations like this \nuh that then uh expanded using uh AI we \nwanted to take these and and uh \noutput them in different formats so we \ncould deliver these to people where they \nare in different platforms different uh \ntypes of output and we built a system \nthat is able to use Vector search and \nlarge language models to take these \ncrowdsourced validated facts and uh and \nnot hallucinate and then use them to \nOutput in in real answers uh from there \nit became even even more powerful than \nthat and I'll let Chris speak to to \nMarianne and some of the \nthe exciting search capabilities we've \nbuilt with it yeah so I guess we started \nby \num really figuring out a way to add \nthese verified facts uh \nand have them show up in the output \ninstead of having uh hallucinated facts \nlike Marco was saying uh and then we're \nwe went one step further and we're like \nokay well if we if we add this these \nfacts and we don't have the context \nneeded to correctly answer the \ninformation then why don't we just go \nout and find that context on the \ninternet \num and so that's you know when Marianne \nwas really born it was a a large \nlanguage model connected to the internet \nuh that that understood when it didn't \nhave enough information to correctly \nanswer uh the question \num and it just it it just keeps on \nsnowballing from from there so now oh \nnow we can do now we can answer not only \nlocal essential information but \ninformation about all sorts of uh items \nand not only can we answer questions but \nwe can actually write content \num with all of these verified info facts \nuh in it so it's been really exciting a \ncouple of well like this point six \nmonths and it's imagine it's going to \nget even more exciting as we continue \ndown this path \nthere's definitely a need for it I mean \nMarco talked about his uh Wildlife story \nand just a story on my end my wife's \nChinese we're trying to go through the \nprocess of getting her to get the green \ncard in America and it's just it's so \nobtuse \num so disjointed all the information \nwhat you need what documents who you got \nto send it to when the timeline we were \nforced to hire a lawyer and it's it's \njust it seems insane because it really \nshould just be like a sort of checklist \nuh kind of process \num but we ended up needing help because \nit's so complex and so hard to deal with \nimagine Mary Marianne next uh next \nrelease Marianne might be able to help \nwith that yeah \nyeah super cool I think the the topic of \nsolving hallucination language models \nwith Vector databases is \nsuch an exciting direction for weviate \nand combining with gbt advances um so \ncan we kind of describe like how \nparticularly are we thinking about \nintegrating the vector search in the \nlanguage model is it this kind of like \nself-ass Chain of Thought prompting \nwhere the language model is kind of \nprobed to say our follow-up questions \nneeded yes and then it will search the \ndatabase or is it just kind of the idea \nof you take the query or previous \ngenerations and use that to search and \nthen just kind of append it \nor general thoughts around how do you \nmake the language model attend to the \nfacts and not just ignore it and \ngenerate something regardless of the \nfacts in the input is this maybe with \nprompting does this require additional \ntraining uh so kind of the thoughts on \nhow exactly \nyeah I'm gonna say all of the above and \nyou know in no particular order just \nsort of start start working towards \nadapting your your system to include all \nof these different uh items and it just \nthey all add the combinatorial makes the \noutput better uh yeah multi-shot \nprompting you know having examples uh \nwithin the prompt space itself was I \nthink our first like iteration uh and \nthen going from \num multi-shot prompting to Dynamic \nprompting where we're we're not it's \njust not static examples they're \nactually examples that fit that \nparticular task best uh and that's again \nthat's being pulled from uh the vector \ndatabase uh of like known good examples \nand we keep on adding to those over time \nso the capabilities improve and that's \njust special prompting now of course you \nyou were saying about chain of uh prompt \nchaining and recursive prompting and you \nstart to to get systems that are \nstrange uh in how they you know they act \nvery human-like you give a hard question \non on Marianne and it might take 28 \nseconds to find the answer why is that \nwell it's because it figured that it \ndidn't quite have enough information \nneeded to go back and search some more \num so it's it's a obviously we don't \nwant to we don't want to like tell you \nexactly how we make the sausage and the \nseasonings that go into it but uh it is \na it is a hodgepodge of many different \nuh things coming together \num \nfine-tuning is is funnily enough one of \nthe last things I think we're we're \nwe're focusing on right now \num because we find the the output from \nthe prompting is so good that we'll be \nable to bootstrap uh enough uh examples \ngood good examples in order to fine tune \nlater on uh so maybe maybe a later step \nwell I mean even the context the con \nyeah the context retrieval model we've \nbeen fine-tuning to to match questions \nand passages from text much much more \neffectively than \num what you can do when you don't fine \ntune so that's I guess that's one one \narea we've really pushed uh on that uh \nmethod but there's always more coming \nout right and I think that might be \nwhere a lot of the \num improvements are coming from for chat \nGPT GPT uh like I'm not sure if it's \njust the model the that was innovated on \nI think they also started to uh include \nsome of these Advanced prompting \ntechniques uh recursive chain of prompt \nChain of Thought prompting and I'm sure \num \na persistent knowledge base uh that \nbecause you it does respond to and maybe \nI'm going a little bit off topic but it \ndoes it does seem to respond to previous \nconversation that you had so there's \ndefinitely a potentially like a look up \nuh vector-based lookup for for previous \ncontext uh when it's it's generating the \nnew answer from it I like I like how the \nmodel is very very Dutch so I asked it \nsomething and then I asked like the same \nquestion in a different way and \nresponded like as I told you before and \nthen it just said \nno but but just just to quickly build on \ntop of what you're saying so what I what \nI find very interesting also from from \nfrom our perspective because for this of \ncourse was very interesting right is \nthat the \nthe collaboration basically that we have \nis that \num you know companies and people like \nyourself Building Products on top of \nsomething like leviate right so whether \nit's part of the the stack of the uh of \nthe um of the uh the the the secret \nSouls I I guess right the um the \num what I find interesting is the \ndifference in the model between \num language understanding and having \ninformation or producing information and \nknowledge and what I mean with that is \nthe following it's like you have like \nthese these statistics right where it \nsays like that like I don't know like 98 \nor something of data is you know is \nbehind closed doors and the rest is is \nout in the public so you could look at \nthese models that are being trained \naside from the perspective like are they \nable to parse the question the the \nnatural language question \nand if we can get them good enough \nto know where they need to find the \ninformation in this case from the factor \ndatabase \nthen I think that's more powerful than \nadding the knowledge itself to the model \nbecause the problem is that if you keep \nadding the knowledge to the model then \nyou need to keep fine-tuning them all \nkeep updating it but let's say that \num let's say that the model \ndoes not know just for the sake of \nargument what what deviate is right \num or no actually an even better example \nis something where time plays a role so \num well I saw here in the back I have \nlike I've hit the Angelo record right so \nlet's say that tomorrow all of a sudden \nhe would release a new record and I \nwould ask the model what's the latest \nthe Angelo record right then it would \ngive me \nthe wrong answer because the training \ndata of course you know had like that \nlatest that latest record I think what's \nvery interesting is that and that's also \nwhat we now see with a gbt chat or chat \ngbt I always forget what way around it \nis but the \nthank you is that the \num \nis that sometimes it also responds like \nI have no connection to the internet \nand that is something that I find super \ninteresting because what you then can do \nis that if you can ask a question like \nokay \nwhat's in this very specific example was \nthe Angelus latest record \nand it can parse that query and then \nbasically ask the vector database like \nhey wait a second \ntell me something about you know the \nrepresentations for like the Angelo \nrecords and those kind of things and it \ngets back a top 10 result \nand then it parses the results and \nReturns the answer then that means you \ncan keep updating the database \nand getting these ends back and what I \nfind very interesting for for companies \nlike you like yourself is like going \nback to that number \nuh a a a a 98 of of data is is \num you know behind closed doors so in \nthe example that you gave about the \ngreen card maybe that's a beautiful \nbusiness for you know for you to sell to \nlaw firms where you can say hey if you \nhave specific data internally that could \nanswer these kind of questions \nautomatically then you're you're cutting \nout the middleman to answer these kind \nof questions \nincentive structure yeah exactly \num we even hope to do that with uh with \ngovernment agencies you helped offload \num \na lot of the work from County clerks for \nexample \nhundreds of emails and phone calls for \neven the smallest of counties uh that \ncould be answered using this and also \nhelp expose data exactly the 98 behind \nclosed doors is a good is a good topic \nbecause there is especially with \nessential local information in \ngovernment and municipalities there is \nso much behind closed doors uh we hope \nto to point this at those data sources \nand really expose it but it is \ninteresting I mean it is such a \nlimitation of models that the Corpus you \nknow chat GPT I believe is up to 2021 \nJuly 2021 so anything temporal that \nhappened since then uh just uh doesn't \nexist \num it's an opportunity for us yeah they \nfor some reason they won't connect it to \nthe internet but we're happy to \noptions right so you have like you have \nlike connecting to the internet but you \nalso have the opportunity to \nuh enrich it with very specific yeah \nBill and knowledge base and \nand what is what is super exciting and \nwe see that in action also because of \nthe things that for example what you \nguys are building is the \nthat that we're that we're starting to \nmove \ntowards this uh um this this natural \nlanguage interaction with these \ndatabases or these these data and the \nreason I find it so interesting was that \none of the early ideas or like the \nthings that sparked also the idea for \nfor \num uh for for viviate was that the \num I was very into this into the \nsemantic web right \nand the problem was that we needed \nhumans to agree on you know nouns and \nthose kind of words you know in advance \nto describe things and that simply \ndidn't work \nright so you get like these noun lists \nand these keyword lists and those kind \nof things and then \nthese um being able to having a uh \num a conversation like we're having now \nin a certain context that I think these \nthese these Vector searchings were like \na well actually the models first of \ncourse and then out of that game \num the the idea to store the information \nbut that you could actually start to \ninteract with these systems \nand then now what you're describing is \nlike a a third step so but if you can \nreally interpret what somebody is asking \nor even keep context and what people are \nasking \nand then send it back to the database so \nthe option it just keeps keeps it just \nkeeps growing \nyeah \njust to build off a little bit what \nyou're saying Bob \num there is definitely a capability \noverhang when it comes to large language \nmodels what we currently have is way \nmore capable than what we are able to to \ntease out of it now but and I think \nthat's because like you said we keep on \nfalling back to what's worked in the \npast which is more data during training \nand maybe that's not it maybe actually \nthese large language models are capable \nenough that if we put them into designed \nsystems we can get them to do things \nthat they would never be able to do \notherwise like when it comes to Marianne \nbeing able to answer the give you the \nright answer faster uh right or or you \nknow when we think about helping County \noffices deal with all this uh all these \nquestions pointing them in the right \ndirection well none of that's using \nfancy you know state-of-the-art large \nit's not using uh 500 billion uh \nparameter models it's it's DaVinci 2 but \nused in uh in in maybe a correct way \nright it often reminds me of the \nintroduction of electricity uh in London \nuh for the factories it actually took 10 \nyears before uh efficiency numbers \nprofitability went up because when \npeople first started using electricity \nthey were just using it in the way that \nthey used to use Steam and actually all \nof the benefit comes from now you can \nreposition the Machinery because you \ndon't have to deal with steam pipes uh \ndelivering power you just have these \nthese cables so uh we're in a similar \nsituation I think with large language \nmodels and it's part of the reason why I \nthink it's coming way faster than we can \nimagine because really what's holding us \nback is just the eyes the spark the \nspark of imagination to to put algorithm \ndown that's uh able to handle situations \nas they come and then when it maybe \nunderstands what it it knows what it \ndoesn't know and then search for that uh \nto try to fill in the gaps yeah I know I \nlike I like this very much and I I think \nso \num I think a lot of what a lot of people \nliked about the model was like the \nanswers that it was producing sometimes \nlike funny or sometimes it was like uh \nyou know the correct answer sometimes \nwrong answers but \num what actually was exciting to me when \nI saw it was that it was parsing the \nquestion \nso it was like and and the moment I saw \nthis parsing my question I didn't care \nanymore this would give me the right \nanswer or not because then because I was \nthinking I was thinking about that 98 \nright so I started thinking like if it \ncan parse that question \nthan with um on the infrastructure level \nthe um the the database but like on a on \nan application Level which you guys are \nbuilding is like there's so much \nopportunity now in in literally every \nevery industry so it's funny it's \nsometimes when I talk to people and then \nsometimes when I'm like at a party or \nsomething right so people \num who might not necessarily listen to \neffective search related podcasts so so \nand they think so what do you do and \nthen explain what they do it's like I'm \nin Search and sometimes people go like \nwe need search and you're like what do \nyou mean we need search everybody and I \nam more and more starting to understand \nlike people are people are unaware that \nif they for example type something in in \num in such a chat window \nthere is a search happening in that \nknowledge base it's everything a search \nso if you really can take that next step \nin in \n[Music] \num \nstoring the information in a way that it \ncan be processed but also parsing the \ninformation to the models that's \nsuper powerful super powerful \nyeah and then that's where you know \nVector search is is so great to \nunderstand the meaning of that search \nand match that with the text that we're \npulling from various places and just \njoining joining those meetings I mean it \nwould not be possible without Vector \nsearch \nyeah no I I agree and I it's the it's \nthe um that's sometimes when I when I \ntalk to people is that I say like so one \nupside that we have with uh with machine \nlearning is that in these kind of \nsituations I always like to call that \nthe uh \num uh um a little bit tongue-in-cheek I \nlike to call like the magic of machine \nlearning because when people see they're \nlike oh that's amazing it's like you \nknow that you do like a card trick so \nit's like it's like it's it's you know \nin the in the you know in under the hood \nit's just software doing stuff but just \nwhen people see it and observe it it's \nlike engage that it gives this part to \nit it feels like magic yeah exactly and \nexactly and I think that is what gets \nalso so so many people excited so that \nthey're like hey but now you know if I \ncan really start to interact with the \nsystems and when I say interact I don't \neven mean \nuh uh chat based interact but \nnatural language a language based form \nof interacting I think that is so \nbecause we we keep on because it's the \nstatus quo right but we keep \nunderestimating how incredibly difficult \nit is \nto turn a search \nlike a question that an end user has \ninto a query if we don't exactly know \nwhat they're looking for that is that is \nextremely hard so these models helping \num uh um in in in translating the the \nthe natural language questions uh to \nstructured questions that we can you \nknow query databases and get these \nresults back yeah that's super powerful \nsuper powerful \ngiving a semantic understanding of those \nquestions of of that question regardless \nof how the user has maybe typed it or uh \nbeing able to ask follow-up questions \nwhen when it's unclear about the and and \nthat's surprisingly not that difficult \nto do with these uh current systems as \nlong as you're you're halfway decent at \nprompting uh you can build these \nfollow-up systems and train them over \nthe course of a couple thousand examples \nto perform really really well at least \nto cover 90 uh 95 of uh questions that \nyou might get \num \nexactly and I find it very interesting \nbecause nowadays you sometimes see these \num uh these interviews on like these \nYouTube channels like with like language \nphilosophers and those kind of things \nand there's also kind of like often you \nknow interest of mine and um and then \nthese these these uh philosophers always \nyou know they make sure that everybody \nunderstand that the machine does not \nhave semantic understanding of what \nsomething means but from my perspective \nI look at this very different because I \nunderstand I I get you know where \nthey're coming from but the point is \njust being able to parse the question \nright and and put that into context and \nthen know from what you know where in \nthis case in Vector space where the \ncontext is stored as you can retrieve \nthat information what we you know in the \nindustry I guess call semantic search \nthat is what makes it so exciting I I \nreally think that even even developers \nright so even developers might sometimes \nnot be aware \nhow extremely hard it is to parse a \nquestion and to know where to find the \nanswer even if you have the answer so \nit's a very human thing right like that \nmatching a question to information or at \nleast where to even look for that \ninformation it's very human it's very \nvery difficult and uh without Vector \nsearch we're what back to keyword based \nsearching and that just doesn't it just \ndoesn't work \nit's just not nearly as capable \nI wanted to have been quickly on this \nidea of this conversation around not \nunderstanding meaning and there's this \ngreat paper that went out it was called \nclimbing towards nlu on meaning and \nunderstanding and language models and \nthe the picture is painted like this \nthere's two people stranded on desert \nislands and they communicate with an \nunderwater cord and an octopus is \nintercepting the chord and it learns how \nto mimic the language such that it could \ncut it and then talk to the other person \nyou know and you don't know it's octopus \nof the person and so that's kind of been \nlike the example of the same the \nlanguage models are just mimicking the \ntext they don't act in it but I think \nnow what we're seeing with chat gbt in \nbuilding on instruct gbt and reinforcing \nlearning from Human feedback is that it \nis embodiment because the language model \nis being given some kind of instruction \nlike \nuh write this in Shakespearean Style \nand then it's predicting the tokens but \nthen it gets that kind of feedback \nsignal so I think I think it is now \nembodied and I think that kind of idea \nthat it doesn't have meaning or \nunderstanding I think that we're \nactually moving past that and I think \nthis reinforcing learning from Human \nfeedback idea can like it I think is \nbeing underappreciated like you still \nsee people reacting to chat gbt like \nit's just predicting the next token well \nit's not it's also you know has humans \nlabeling how well it's following the \ninstructions and I think that's just a \nsignificant difference \nyou know I I I I just to add a little \nbit I I maybe I don't see it as a \ndifference at all actually then maybe \nthat is just intelligence it's it's \npicking the next right word right how \nhow much of really great podcasting is \njust knowing what to say when right \npredicting the most effective like maybe \nwe we have that ability internally as \nhumans but we're just now getting to the \npoint where we we figure out how to do \nit with computers uh and \nI'd like to think that there is a \nthe same type of intelligence that we \nhave for natural language processing \nthey are gaining like at least uh \nthe ability \num \nand \nyou know it's it's truly \nI think intelligent what's missing is \nthe persistence aspect of it like the \nproblem is none of these systems \npersistently exist over days weeks \nmonths years and so have no ability to \nto uh form like long-term memories and \nand I think that's when we would start \nto be wonder whether or not they truly \nare intelligent when they have that \npersistence so they're sort of like at \ncall right now and only exist for a \nshort time before they're you know \nscrubbed and then like refresh somewhere \nelse again I think that goes back to the \ndatabases website would come in uh \nbecause the vector databases is that \npersistent yeah Vector search is that \npersistence and what is intelligence but \nbeing able to do the next right thing \nbased on your associations that you've \nlearned yeah uh and what is you know the \nassociation it enables those \nassociations it really is powering those \nintelligent systems \nyeah and I I quickly I I quickly want to \ngo \num uh back to what Connor said because \nwhat I find what I what I find \ninteresting is like I strongly believe \nthat we make these systems \nfor humans right so we make it for each \nother to help each other right that is \nthat is that is what that's why we build \nthese systems \nso if somebody says well you know the \nthing is just doing is predicting you \nknow the right token or if somebody says \noh you know in effective database you're \njust doing like a distance calculation \nfrom one to another sure but that's now \nI mean we now have like the uh the the \nthe the the the soccer championship \nhappening right so it's actually that's \nthe same thing that if somebody scores a \nbeautiful goal that you say oh there was \njust a signal sent from the brain you \nknow to his feet and you know they had \nto kick the ball yeah that's true but \nthat's I kind of uh that defeats the \npoint of for what it's doing right it's \ncreating and sending value in the case \nof soccer I guess like entertainment \nvalue and and in the um in in in the in \nthe case of vector database it's like \nit's a information retrieval value right \nso the two use cases for example that \nyou guys mentioned in the beginning so \nfor me those kind of arguments like oh \nyeah it's just you know predicting the \nnext token I'd app that I just I it goes \nin here and goes out there because I was \nlike you know who cares it's starting to \nadd value to uh to people's lives and \nwe just know that it's gone it's a \nmatter of time \nbefore people we will hear the stories \nthat people say like oh thanks to these \nsystems I could you know I was able to \ndo X thanks to these systems I was able \nto do why that is it's already happening \nbut that's just gonna be more exactly \nit's already happening \nyeah I think it's \num and again what chat GPT I think has \ndone is brought it to people's attention \nmore quickly I think what we've you know \npeople in the industry have maybe seen \nthis coming uh for several months and \nexperience but now it's bringing it to \nthe masses and people are just realizing \nand I think quickly or going or already \nusing it to help them in in day-to-day \ntasks and it is adding value from the \nthe programmer to the uh the student \num \nit has so but really excited to see now \nwith more companies doing what we're \ndoing is integrating it as part of a \nbigger system \nyeah and what I find interesting and \nthat is just a uh um and I saw somebody \ntweeted this but I I forgot who I I \nforgot who sent out this tweet but the \nthing is like we're spending so much \ntime right so we're making these bought \ngas to talk about it we have or we have \nthe academic research we have the blogs \nwe have like and everybody's doing that \nstuff throwing it into the outside world \nand then it just takes an input uh uh \nyou know an input box on a website where \npeople can just type it in and I found \nthat fascinating goes for for you guys \nas well I remember that you had the \nfirst tweet uh I think there was also \ntweeters like you know people cannot try \nit out and yet like the the link and you \ncan could ask a few questions and I was \nlike super exciting to see and people \nwere actually trying it out and and and \nand testing it so I was like oh this is \nIt's just sometimes it's so interesting \nso sometimes something is like in the \nair and people go like you know we're \ngoing to get it but nah not completely \nand then it's just an input box and it \ndoesn't matter if it's you guys doing it \nor or opening eye doing it just \nthe people you can type something in and \nthat they just get a response back and I \nwas and I thought I was like I had to \nlaugh about it because we're spending so \nmuch time making content and explaining \nto people this is what's happening on \nthe hoot and those kind of things and \nthen it just took an input box for \npeople to fill something like oh now I \nget it \n[Laughter] \nyes yes yes yeah yeah that's actually I \nlike that so it's like it's it would be \nthe same as like \num like if you see like you know an a \nmagician who would start off by you know \ntelling how uh how he or she's gonna \nmake an elephant disappear right you \njust you don't care you just want to see \nin Heavenly basically yeah interesting \nso so I'm curious I'm curious to hear \nwhat what kind of what you guys think \nthat you might see happening because \nwhat's very interesting for for somebody \nlike like myself right it's like the \num in our case we're like an \ninfrastructure database provider that \nhelps you know in this stack \num and and these types of applications \nthat your building is like amazing \nbecause that brings it really into the \nhands of of of \num you know like literally everybody \nright so just to the the the non-so fair \nfolks if you will and I'm just I'm just \ncurious where you think so if you just \ndream a little bit about like what you \nthink that will be happening in the in \nthe near future what if you have to \nguess what what do you think that they \nwill see in in the coming year \nI mean if you want to go first sure \nright we've \nwe've pondered this a lot um and it's \nthings are moving so quickly uh much \nfaster than I think anyone even expected \nand it's only going to continue to uh \ngrow more exponentially \num \nI don't I don't think people are used to \nnatural language uh questions asking and \ngetting natural language answers yet \nuh because it just that's not how people \nnecessarily necessarily search on Google \nand to be honest Alexa in Siri which are \npeople's uh you know General interaction \nwith that is not very good uh at those \nanswers uh you know they're kind of \nglorified clock timers and and weather \nuh and they can tell you the weather but \nas far as you know actually answering \nlike we're seeing Marianne or Chet GPT \nthey're not there so I don't think \npeople have gotten used to this format \nyet uh and once they realize that they \nthey can \num this is how we normally talk this is \nhow we normally ask things so I think \nwe'll go back to to speaking like this \nwhere I think eventually it will go uh \npossibly an always-on type of digital \nassistant uh that's listening to your \nconversation uh and inserting itself an \nadding value where when it thinks you \nmight need to know something when you \nmight have a question uh somewhat like \nthe old Sci-Fi movies where you wake up \nand you're speaking to the room \nbecause I don't think the input box is \ngoing to be is the most efficient \ninterface anymore and I think the \ncapabilities of this and are just so \ngreat that now we're now we can go there \nnow we can enable systems like this \neventually \nyou know from my end I I have thought a \nlot about this and I think uh chat GPT \num was really a watershed moment like I \nkeep on thinking back to the movie \nInterstellar when they are on the plan \nthe water planet \nuh and then they see uh what looks like \nmountains in the background and like oh \nmountains that's so crazy and then they \nlook behind themselves and they just see \nlike a towering wave coming for them I \nvery much feel like we're at that point \num and the easiest way for me to try to \nconceptualize it is I I agree with Marco \nthere's persistence in these agents \num that are going to be a thing uh and \nso \nwhat does the world look like when \nthere's a trillion people in it and 99 \nof them are Flesh and Bones and the rest \nof them are like digital intelligent \nagents going around what's that world \nlook like I have no idea you know it's \njust it's it's it's \nit's it's I think it's coming very very \nshortly like in the next two to four to \nfive years we're gonna have agents that \nare \npersistent uh that can travel and decide \nwhat to work on and do and \nI just I don't I I guess I should get \nused to saying please and thank you to \nto my digital assistants because they \nmight I don't want to piss them off when \nthey become sentient \nyeah \nno but that that's that's super that's \nsuper interesting and I I think so of \ncourse \num what we sometimes keep forgetting is \nthat language is just \nthat's just a form right so we can we \nyou can tokenize like kinda everything \nright so think about like games or \num uh or or like I don't know lab \nAssistance or something right where you \ncan choose also \num uh store or predict you know certain \ntypes of behaviors and those kind of \nthings so I think that's that's gonna be \nthat that's gonna be coming as well and \nwhich is not per se driven through \num uh true language so I find that just \nit's just you know or degenerative for \nthose kind of things so I find that that \nis very exciting as well it's uh \num I'm also what I also find interesting \nbecause I what I really like you guys \ntook like like also a little bit like \nthe Long View although that in in in our \nworld of course the Longview is like \nsoon but I think also if you look at \nlike tomorrow for example just to be \npregnant is it \num I'm also very curious to see how \num \nhow one people will integrate this into \nexisting businesses so I'm thinking for \nexample about like um ticket systems or \nthose kind of things so when I have like \nthe airline I want to ask a question \nlike why where's my luggage you know \nthose kind of things that they that you \ncan figure it out in in an NLP fashion \nbut even what I'm more interested in is \nlike new businesses that we will see so \npeople can build new things on these \nsystems like like completely new \nproducts new services \num uh on top of thesis and I'm looking \nvery much forward to \num uh uh to to see what's happening \nthere right so I saw for example \num uh recently I saw there was a there \nwasn't based on the generative model \nwhere you had certain voices of uh \nfamous actors and there's like a startup \nand that they say well rather than \nactually hiring the actor \nall right she just give us the text and \nwhen we have the the actor you know \num uh um you know say the lines but the \ncool thing is that that's a new business \nopportunity also for these creatives \nlike these actors right because yes they \nnow don't have to do like the like the \none recording but they can do like \nhundreds or thousands recordings \nsimultaneously why while you know they \ncan see they can skill that so I also \nthink so for example I think also for \nthe creative industry so this is going \nto be great because of course you know \nsome people are a little bit scared Etc \nbut that's fine but I actually think \nit's going to help people in um being \nmore creative and make more \num uh do it faster so that you can just \nhave a higher output of quality so \nall these kind of businesses \nfrom from from a generative like like \nlike language integrating it with the \ndatabase you get the right information \nout but also for \nbasically any creative process that \nwe're doing as humans and I regardless \nif you're creative as like as like a \ndoctor or like a visual artist I I \nthink we're going to see a lot of new \nbusinesses pop up based on these kind of \nmodels \nwe're kind of that chain of like the \nunderstanding of what somebody means \nplus the information retrieval plus the \ninformation storage \nit's kind of it what I like was like \nalso the analogy of the wave right \nbecause \nall of a sudden the puzzle seems to be \ncompleted from the beginning to the end \nright and then all of a sudden all those \nideas start streaming and people start \nto build new things and that's something \nthey're super excited about \njust you know it you you talked about \ncreativity uh and I actually work with \nanother company that is using this to \nturn natural language questions about \ndata into data visualizations and python \ncode that collects the data from your \nspecific uh data Escape so it's it it \nit's coming and it's it's so it's so \nfast uh to build too if you know if you \nhave the experience with these large \nlanguage models you can spin something \nup pretty quick that covers 80 it's only \na perfect MVP tool yeah it just launched \nthese things but I I also agree I think \nit's going to affect every business in \nevery industry I think uh it's not just \nso many new businesses that will be \ncoming so many new businesses that \nor current businesses that are almost \nobsolete as well and new businesses to \nreplace them uh if they don't adapt and \nstart uh utilizing some of these tools \nbut uh I think you're right Bob the the \npuzzle Has Come Together between Vector \nsearch these foundational models uh \nreally the the elements are there to \nbuild these systems and it's a very \nexciting time to be a part of it that \nfeels really transformational yeah \nyeah I I agree I agree and that is \nthat's great and I think one thing to \nbuild on top of also something that \nConnor said about that research there's \nthere's this other research paper I need \nto I need to look it up because it's \nlike I I don't know about heart but it's \nit's actually a pretty old paper where \nthey where they make an argument \num so they have like this this thought \nexperiment where they're saying okay you \nhave two people right one person is just \num you know completely healthy but \nsomebody else is like you know it's \nmaybe like starting to forget certain \nthings right and you both test them with \nwalking from the same you know point to \num in a city to for example Museum \nthe first person just you tell them okay \nStraight Ahead left left right Etc and \nthen you're at the Museum but the other \nperson who keeps forgetting you give \nthem a \num a note and the note just says okay \nyou're on your way to the museum go you \nknow left left right left right then \nyou're at the Museum and what the what \nthe \num that paper is arguing so the question \nthat's being asked in the paper is like \nwould it be fair to say that this note \nor this notebook is an extension of the \nbrain \nbecause the \num \ncan we can we can we make that claim and \nthen the paper argues yes you can make \nthat claim so for example if you want to \nremember somebody's phone number back in \nthe day right you wrote it down \nthere's kind of an extension of your \nbrain outside and you just you know you \nread it and then you have that \ninformation and then that experiment or \nsorry that that thought experiment is \nredone \nbased on search online so can we make \nthe argument that search online uh \nextends the extents of the brain and \nthen they come to the same conclusion \nwe're saying yes we think that you can \nmake that argument because if you just \nyou know don't know in what year the \nEiffel Tower is built you know you just \nin today you you Google it or nowadays I \nguess you would ask exactly \nand um and and get the um and get the \nanswer and I think \nso what we're doing is like we're we're \ncreating these systems to extend like \nthis Collective brain not only with \npublic information but also information \nthat you know that might be behind \nclosed or just imagine that you have \nsuch an integration with your with your \nbank right so you might ask a question \nabout like you know where about certain \nyou know clothes or something that you \nlike and then it interacts it \nautomatically interface with your bank \nand it's just like okay you know you \ncould go to the store but bear in mind \nyou know you don't you don't you don't \nhave enough money in your bank account \nthose kind of things that it \nintelligently starts to make those \nconnections \nthat is what it's enabling and I and and \nthat goes back to what I said earlier \nabout the semantic web that it I think \nit was \ngenerally speaking underestimated in the \nindustry \nhow big of a problem it was that we as \nhumans needed to make these connections \ninside the databases \nand that we now not have to do that \nanymore \ncreates this whole stream all the way to \nthe previous argument that was my story \nthat was 10 like okay so now we can \nstart to extend that Collective brain \nbecause it starts to make those \nconnections automatically and I strongly \nbelieve that so it's like a uh \num and and yes \na factor search plays a role in that the \nmodels play a role in that but also what \nyou're building with Marianne Ryan so \nthat you say okay so this is an example \nof such an application that people can \nuse on a day-to-day basis so it's just \nthe the explosion of creativity coming \nout of this is super exciting to me \nyeah I think I think we don't even \nrealize how smart we can be also and \nkind of on this user interface is one \nthing I kind of want to bring up this \nmultimodal idea and I saw this one demo \nfrom anthropic or Adept I always mix up \nthe companies and I'm sorry fans but \nwhat it is is it's like recording your \nscreen so you say to gbt like I'm trying \nto import one million data objects to \nweviate and then it'll watch my screen \nit'll watch me like get going my \nterminal download the docker composer to \nwatch me interacting with the web and \nthen it would like suggest things on the \nside so it's it's kind of like a \ndifferent interface compared to where \nyou talk about the data visualization \nand you imagine like okay I got this \nmatplotlib error so now I need to copy \nand paste everything give it to the chat \nwindow compared to something that's like \nalways watching you doing your task \nexactly I think that always on type \nproactive assistant uh to maybe deliver \nthe results versus waiting for you to \nask for it yeah you've got to think from \nuh computational uh efficient energy \nenergy efficient standpoint what what is \nbetter the specific tool that runs on \nvery \nvery low cost hardware and software \nversus uh an adapt like tool that you \nknow you have to push 1080p video to a \nsystem embed it what's going to win out \nin that situation well I think the for \npeople who can afford it uh the \nalways-on everything assistant is going \nto be the thing to do but you might need \nthe best hardware on the planet to run \nit right you might need to have the \nknowledge and capabilities of \nlaunching a server with a couple gpus in \norder to get it going \nand at that point maybe maybe it does \nmake more sense to go to that \nspecialized tool that just turns my my \nPro I understand I need a data science \nthing I'll go to the data science tool \nand then uh work with that in order to \nreduce the cost I mean it's it's going \nto be a very interesting landscape of I \ndon't think I think the the \nI think the obvious or the first thing \nto think about is like there's going to \nbe like one winner take all but I think \nbecause of the the hardware constraints \non on these systems there's gonna be \nplenty of room for \nthe more specialized low-cost Tool uh in \nin that new landscape so don't know and \nwe were just talking about this \nyesterday about what's going to win is \nlike does facts have a chance you know \nkids are going to survive when you know \nGTP 4 and chat GTP 4 come out I think \nprobably at least for the the next five \nyears yeah for sure uh there's gonna be \nthat uh especially if we partner with \nlike organizations that are going to \nexist despite the introduction of AI uh \nlike governments or Community local \ncommunities like integrating directly \nwith them and helping them like \ntransition and and start using these \ntools in a way helpful for them yep and \nsolves their their everyday problems \num not everyone's a coder right so \nno no exactly but I think so they're \nlike I if I may I would like to unpack \ntwo things about what you're saying \nbecause that something that I find very \ninteresting is the \num \nso so two things so the first thing is \nlike the um \nso so my my work is right so I'm like in \nin in software business right that \nthat's what I do and that's that's how I \nmake for since forever a living and the \num and and I'm always very interested in \nthese \num these laws right that start to appear \nlike hey you have like uh you know \nconways all those kind of things so \nthey're they're things we're learning \nabout what software is doing and \nand one of these these laws is that \num and it does not per se from digital \nbusiness but it's like it's something we \nespecially see in digital business is \nlike that um uh the solution that that \nbrings the the less the the least amount \nof friction is something that people \num are willing to to use and and even if \nso if they get enough value from it \nthey're fine you know to just you know \num look away with certain you know \nsituations like for example with like \nnow with with all the the chat \napplications or these always on \nsituations where you might like you know \nmaybe \num uh um you know I don't know whether \nthe information is going where that \ninformation is being stored but it gives \nme so much value that I'm willing that \nI'm willing to do that I think a um not \nnot to divert Too Much from the from the \nfrom the subject matter but just to make \nmy point is the I always found it very \ninteresting with like everything that's \nhappening also like in cryptocurrency \nright so because that's also that's like \noutside of my realm of expertise but it \nhappens also in business and what I find \nfascinating that the claim was like okay \nyou're gonna have a private key \nbut these things are hard to use so now \nyou get like digital Banks right that \nstore that information \nand \nI think the same thing is like with \num what you guys are building with \nMarianne or if that's like \num the these these screen capturing \ntools Etc that \nso much value is being created for \npeople the people like I want this right \nI need this in my life because it's \nhelping me so that is the first thing \nright so that I think that we now we \nwe're past that point \nwhere so much value is being created \nthat people like okay \ngive it to me right I want this I want \nto I want to be able to use this because \nthe ux is just great and the second \nthing that I find uh very interesting is \nthat I think \nlike these winner take all \nuh uh \nbusinesses that just that just not a lot \nof them right so and especially also in \nyour domain and what you're doing what \nyou just said right so because yes so we \nnow keep \nreferencing for example the models that \nopenai has but let's not forget a lot of \nthese similar open source models that \nare being produced right we should not \nforget that so if you're like a \ngovernment agency and that for for a \ngood reason it's like we would love to \nhave such a service but you know \nunfortunately we you know we can't use a \nthird-party service or something like \nthat then there are like solutions for \nthat as well so it's like a there's and \nand it's fine because you know there's \nso much value being created by so many \npeople for so many people that I think \nuh uh that we will not see \num uh last companies I think we should \nwe will see more \nlet me see look at so I recently saw a \nlist of companies that just now have \ngenerative Services right so that you \nsaid okay write me a LinkedIn post for \num \nyou know something I want to sell and uh \nand I was just surprised about the \namount of companies that not our only \nfound it to solve this but they're \nactually also finding niches and being \nprofitable and successful in these \nniches \nit's just we're just scratching the \nsurface I really believe that \nyeah I agree I think the niche focusing \non the niches is uh there's so much \ndetail in minutia in \nwhen you get into any industry uh \nthere's always going to be opportunity \nto really better solve that specific \nproblem \num and now and people have the tools to \ndo so now yeah \nyeah you know it makes you think also \nmaybe maybe actually that that winner \ntake all business is just the the one \nthat can turn a natural language prompt \ninto like pointing to the right Niche \nservice that can best solve that that \nspecific prompt \num I mean it's very interesting just I \nwant to touch base a little bit what you \nsaid earlier because I think it \nresonates with what we've experienced is \nthat we've started with GTP and da Vinci \nuh and the new instruct uh GTP but then \nwhat we find is uh actually we once we \nget enough uh usage on our product then \nwe have all the data we need to train \nour own open source fine tune our own \nopen source models and just hop off of \nuh the GPT uh ecosystem at least until \nthe next best thing comes along and we \nwe figure out how to do that really well \nand rebuild our examples and then \nfine-tune our our own system so it's you \nknow there is definitely ways for people \nto \nto grow and get value from using a third \nparty like uh cohere or open and I want \nto give some some love to the other \npeople the other companies in the room \nas well uh can't wait till adapt uh \nAdept releases uh if anyone here is uh \nworking on adapt uh please hit us up and \nlet us get some access to the API we'd \nlove to to \num use it to help make people's lives \neasier uh in terms of actually doing the \nactions like hey can you apply for a \ngreen card for me and my wife all right \ndepth to take it away and that's what's \ncoming next uh is actually you know now \nwe're helping people find the right \nanswer faster yeah \num next up we will also be using we V8 \nto help suggest services and programs \nand resources that might apply to people \nas we understand more about that person \none of the big problems \num in this country and I'm sure \neverywhere is under utilization of these \nprograms and services people might \nqualify for certain things or might uh \nthere's one of the things I discovered \nuh \nbuilding this business so far is how \nmuch free tutoring there is for children \nall across country in real time we can \ngo online and find free tutors to help \nyou with Calculus right now someone's \nsitting there open and willing \num and so you know I had no idea and uh \nthat's just a basic example but you know \nhelping people with heating bills \nhelping people qualify for free \nBroadband uh so suggesting those \nprograms and then next up is helping \npeople actually complete those actions \nuh take advantage of them uh which is I \nI like the example that buyer interests \nuse when we got a demo abbreviate and he \nwas like I'm hungry and then we were \nable to serve food banks in the local \narea and that's what we want to get to \nwe want to be like hey bring us your \nneeds your problems that you're having \nand we'll help you get connected to not \nwhat the Nationwide that but the your \nlocal essential uh ecosystem what exists \nwhere you are at because that's the \nprobably the best place for you to get \nthe help that you need uh get the \nsupport \num and that's what we're really trying \nto build you know I think you said it \nearlier it started with the wildfire and \nlike getting the most useful and local \ninformation but I mean there's just so \nmuch that people don't realize that's \nout there in terms of resources and \nthings you could accomplish and the the \nthe issues that people just don't know \nwhat they don't know and the problem is \ncreation yeah curation there's so much \nout there it's hard to find what you're \nlooking for it's a needle in a haystack \nsometime and that again yeah who who \nknows the very specific local name of \nthe program that's going to help you you \njust have a problem you've got to \ndescribe that problem and get you know \nhopefully get surface the right uh \ninformation or program for your for your \nspecific problem that situation \nyeah and that's very interesting and I \nnow when you're when you're giving these \nexamples I'm also thinking like \nthese um we're now very much talking \nabout like how we use these models at \nquery time because all these examples \nyou give like they're like at query time \ndo something \num uh what I think is is going to be \nvery interesting to see \nif these models can help in structuring \nthe information when we when we create \nthe information right so that could be \nand I'm I'm now just from the top of my \nhead right so an idea might be like if \nyou store information about \num well the the examples food banks on a \nwebsite that the model says well if you \nstructure like this it's easier to \nprocess or it's easier to get access to \nso they were not only solving the \nproblem unlike in on a query on query \nperspective but also on and from from an \ninput perspective right or maybe even \nthen it can even help with generating \nthat kind of uh pure kind of content \nI think we're already using it yeah \nyou're speaking to the choir yeah we're \nwe're we're \nalready using it we're using AI to help \nus one of the problems again is there's \nso much information out there there's so \nmany links and phone numbers which is \nright which is correct which is relevant \nwhich is which is essential uh so we \nhave in part of our pipeline we're uh \nWe've trained a model to help us \ndetermine if something is essential or \nnot so it's already helping us uh you \nknow filter down and uh structure the \ndata better on that that's that's a \nlittle bit farther away from the query \nside but even even go farther away uh we \ntake the these verified facts and we \nproduce content with them we produce \nlocal news summaries we produce uh facts \nyou know question answer pairs that are \nin human language and they're easy to \nsearch using your current channels like \nGoogle uh We've even talked about \nstarting to publish these things on \nTwitter accounts like a local a local \nessential new uh news information you \ncan follow and and find all of these \ninteresting if we surface all sorts of \nstuff I mean anything you can think of \nthere's usually someone in your \ncommunity that's helping that's that's \nthere to that's their job that's that's \nwhat they do and they help and they it's \njust so hard to find uh so we have been \ndoing it we just published another 40 \n000 facts uh on on facts yesterday and \nwe'll be there's no reason why we \ncouldn't do that uh you know a hundred \nthousand times every every week for the \nnext next couple weeks it's just that \npowerful \nand I have a question so I so now this \nis very intriguing right so in in the \nbeginning of this conversation you \ntalked about like the the the the the \nsecret Souls right so so \num so if is there something in the souls \nthat you can just share with us where \nyou go like well if we look at the code \nbase \noh there's this there's one thing this \none one ingredient in the whole sauce \nlike without giving the sauce how you \nmix but like this one ingredient in \nthere we go like we're so proud of that \nwe're so proud of that wow I think \nthere's a is there one I mean you can \nyou can speak to that I think what I'm \nproud of is the the human verification \naspect and the fact that we've gotten \nyou know at this point over 12 000 \npeople contributing to uh to sourcing \nand validating uh these facts so really \nthe the human \nI don't want to forget about humans in \nthis process too because AI is better \nwith humans uh humans plus AI makes it \nmakes all the output better uh and that \nreally is that that virtuous Loop right \nthat that flywheel \num but as far as our secret you know \naside from the I think so I think that's \nthat's a big part of uh our product and \nthen \nthat's a that's a really interesting \nquestion I like \nI think we need more prompt space for \nsure I need more prompt space I need uh \nway more prompt space because more con I \nwas finally it's interesting and then \njust the side part here but I find that \nwords in prompt space almost act like \npointers \nso if you use more words in the Target \narea that you're trying to answer for \nyou get better results \ndon't quite understand what the dynamic \nor like what might be causing that with \nthe dynamic how to explain it or even if \nthere's a word to describe that \nphenomena but \nI think it's important like \nmore prompt space more examples more \ncontext \nuh exactly isn't the word context \nit's called yeah it's it's context \nyou're absolutely right it is context \nthe more context I can fit within that \nprompt the better the answer is oh is \ngoing to be always more examples of like \ngood quality exactly you know that that \nreally is I think where I could get \nwhere personally with the current uh \nalgorithm how it's set up get the most \nbang for my buck but I do see \num like algorithmic Innovation being \nsuper important like I can't we quite \nquite like it's hard to get the model to \nto understand what it doesn't understand \nlike if we could if if I could get that \nthe system to display that quality I \nthink we would be at a point where I \ncould just let it run consistently and \nsee see what happens like I there's just \na lot to do I I really these intelligent \nit's we have a new paradigm it's not a \nVon Neumann machine it's something else \nthey uh and we don't know how we don't \nquite know what how to put these things \ntogether in order to build like the CPU \nof the large language model error you \nknow like but I think it's there I think \nit's there for the picking like it \nhasn't really been discovered Deep Mind \nfor all it's amazingness hasn't hasn't \nquite cracked that code yet but you just \nsaid something that really triggered me \nit's like I was like that's like because \nwe were just talking about like you know \nall these business ideas then that then \nstartup ideas ever come from this I just \nthe the word that just popped into my \nmind when you were describing everything \nabout context was like fingerprinting so \nlet's say that you just let's say that \nyou have like um the the the always on \nsystem right so that keeps giving \ncontext to the model of like who I am \ncan be in natural language can be in how \nI my screen recording and I say okay now \nwe have like a fingerprint of you know \nwho Bob is \nso now I might go to uh um to use \nMarianne in my government situation I \ncan't give it access to public web but I \ndon't mind feeling it my fingerprint so \nthat it's like boom it has my contacts \nlike oh okay oh so this is this guy \nright so and it knows what you need yes \nit's almost there's there's like an \nembedding exchange like if it was easier \nfor everyone to to share the user \nembeddings generated in that specific \ncontext or give access to that uh \ncontext for the user to then bring to \nother services probably something that \nprobably a really really interesting \nbusiness right there \nor just imagine that you that you \nsubscribe to like to Netflix right and \nthen rather than say like what movies do \nyou like say okay just upload your you \nknow your embeddings fingerprint yeah \nyou're embedding yeah at my Google \nsearch history yeah done now I \nunderstand that's what I like yeah what \nI find interesting about the about the \nabout the embeddings is that it's it's \nso \num if if I go into a bar and have a \nconversation with somebody I've never \nseen right then you have a conversation \nand a little bit of context is going \nback and forth to figure out like okay \nis do I have a connection with this \nperson right is it interesting to have a \nconversation about \nyou know whatever \num I don't have to show this person my \nGoogle search history for this person to \ngo like oh this is an interesting person \nto talk to like oh no I'm not gonna just \napproach this person you know \num so and that is I think what these \nwhat these these these fingerprints \ncould do is the \num uh is that you basically can say okay \nwait a second \nuh it's a way without like giving all \nthat information about myself right just \nmore like I have a a representation of \nme basically in in in Vector space if \nyou will yeah \nyeah I mean it's just it's it's a dating \napp for those embedding is what you're \ndescribing even you know uh it's very \ninteresting it's good too because it's \nactually privacy preserving it's right \nit's the only information you're \ntransmitting is your relationship with \nthat with that user base in in that \nservice you're not you're not actually \nshowing them your Google searches uh \nsearch uh files just how similar your \neyes to uh one user or the other uh \nwhich I think is another really great \nthing because it's a lot in terms of \nmental barrier I know I don't feel bad \nabout sharing I would feel bad about \nsharing uh my Google search my entire \nGoogle search history to to everyone but \njust the embedding this this you know \n256 long long character string boom easy \nyeah and I think that might actually be \nlike a nice uh even like a nice uh \nuh uh like a conclusion of this of this \nconversation right where we say like \nokay these \num \nwe we \nit's like over that Tipping Point on \nmultiple levels where people where it's \nlike good enough to give people the \nright value \nand \nthe way that the information is stored \nand the way that we current information \nis \nso radically different from how we're \ndoing that you know in like
