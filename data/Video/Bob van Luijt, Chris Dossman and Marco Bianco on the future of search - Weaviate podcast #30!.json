{"text": "Thank you so much for watching the 30th episode of the Weaviate podcast! ChatGPT has landed, leaving a massive impact on the ... \nforeign[Music]'s chat gbt is an incrediblebreakthrough in artificial intelligencechat gbt has inspired many people towonder about the future of searchengines the latest weba podcast featurespeople at The Cutting Edge of largelanguage models and search technologytogether today we host semi-technologyCEO Bob Van light and facts co-foundersChris dossman and Marco Biancouh so thank you so much for joining theweba podcastthanks for having us yeah thank youit's like we maybe kicked this off uhMarco and Chris could you tell us aboutuh what you're building sure well factswas uh born from a bad experience I hadliving in Southern California where meand my uh wife and two young children atthe time had to evacuate because ofwildfiresum and when trying to figure out uh whatalerts to sign up for what uh Twitteraccounts to follow or Facebook pages tofollow and uh it was all completelydisjointed very difficult to find thatinformationtook me about two full days to feel likeI really had you know coverage andunderstood uh what was going on and umso it was born out of need from that andrealizing man if it if it took me uh ifit was this difficult for me most peopleare gettingbest incomplete information and it worksbad or no information so originally ourgoal was to just crowdsource validate uhthese essential facts uh links phonenumbers uh things that people need inday-to-day life uh as and for you knowemergency situations like thisuh that then uh expanded using uh AI wewanted to take these and and uhoutput them in different formats so wecould deliver these to people where theyare in different platforms different uhtypes of output and we built a systemthat is able to use Vector search andlarge language models to take thesecrowdsourced validated facts and uh andnot hallucinate and then use them toOutput in in real answers uh from thereit became even even more powerful thanthat and I'll let Chris speak to toMarianne and some of thethe exciting search capabilities we'vebuilt with it yeah so I guess we startedbyum really figuring out a way to addthese verified facts uhand have them show up in the outputinstead of having uh hallucinated factslike Marco was saying uh and then we'rewe went one step further and we're likeokay well if we if we add this thesefacts and we don't have the contextneeded to correctly answer theinformation then why don't we just goout and find that context on theinternetum and so that's you know when Mariannewas really born it was a a largelanguage model connected to the internetuh that that understood when it didn'thave enough information to correctlyanswer uh the questionum and it just it it just keeps onsnowballing from from there so now ohnow we can do now we can answer not onlylocal essential information butinformation about all sorts of uh itemsand not only can we answer questions butwe can actually write contentum with all of these verified info factsuh in it so it's been really exciting acouple of well like this point sixmonths and it's imagine it's going toget even more exciting as we continuedown this paththere's definitely a need for it I meanMarco talked about his uh Wildlife storyand just a story on my end my wife'sChinese we're trying to go through theprocess of getting her to get the greencard in America and it's just it's soobtuseum so disjointed all the informationwhat you need what documents who you gotto send it to when the timeline we wereforced to hire a lawyer and it's it'sjust it seems insane because it reallyshould just be like a sort of checklistuh kind of processum but we ended up needing help becauseit's so complex and so hard to deal withimagine Mary Marianne next uh nextrelease Marianne might be able to helpwith that yeahyeah super cool I think the the topic ofsolving hallucination language modelswith Vector databases issuch an exciting direction for weviateand combining with gbt advances um socan we kind of describe like howparticularly are we thinking aboutintegrating the vector search in thelanguage model is it this kind of likeself-ass Chain of Thought promptingwhere the language model is kind ofprobed to say our follow-up questionsneeded yes and then it will search thedatabase or is it just kind of the ideaof you take the query or previousgenerations and use that to search andthen just kind of append itor general thoughts around how do youmake the language model attend to thefacts and not just ignore it andgenerate something regardless of thefacts in the input is this maybe withprompting does this require additionaltraining uh so kind of the thoughts onhow exactlyyeah I'm gonna say all of the above andyou know in no particular order justsort of start start working towardsadapting your your system to include allof these different uh items and it justthey all add the combinatorial makes theoutput better uh yeah multi-shotprompting you know having examples uhwithin the prompt space itself was Ithink our first like iteration uh andthen going fromum multi-shot prompting to Dynamicprompting where we're we're not it'sjust not static examples they'reactually examples that fit thatparticular task best uh and that's againthat's being pulled from uh the vectordatabase uh of like known good examplesand we keep on adding to those over timeso the capabilities improve and that'sjust special prompting now of course youyou were saying about chain of uh promptchaining and recursive prompting and youstart to to get systems that arestrange uh in how they you know they actvery human-like you give a hard questionon on Marianne and it might take 28seconds to find the answer why is thatwell it's because it figured that itdidn't quite have enough informationneeded to go back and search some moreum so it's it's a obviously we don'twant to we don't want to like tell youexactly how we make the sausage and theseasonings that go into it but uh it isa it is a hodgepodge of many differentuh things coming togetherumfine-tuning is is funnily enough one ofthe last things I think we're we'rewe're focusing on right nowum because we find the the output fromthe prompting is so good that we'll beable to bootstrap uh enough uh examplesgood good examples in order to fine tunelater on uh so maybe maybe a later stepwell I mean even the context the conyeah the context retrieval model we'vebeen fine-tuning to to match questionsand passages from text much much moreeffectively thanum what you can do when you don't finetune so that's I guess that's one onearea we've really pushed uh on that uhmethod but there's always more comingout right and I think that might bewhere a lot of theum improvements are coming from for chatGPT GPT uh like I'm not sure if it'sjust the model the that was innovated onI think they also started to uh includesome of these Advanced promptingtechniques uh recursive chain of promptChain of Thought prompting and I'm sureuma persistent knowledge base uh thatbecause you it does respond to and maybeI'm going a little bit off topic but itdoes it does seem to respond to previousconversation that you had so there'sdefinitely a potentially like a look upuh vector-based lookup for for previouscontext uh when it's it's generating thenew answer from it I like I like how themodel is very very Dutch so I asked itsomething and then I asked like the samequestion in a different way andresponded like as I told you before andthen it just saidno but but just just to quickly build ontop of what you're saying so what I whatI find very interesting also from fromfrom our perspective because for this ofcourse was very interesting right isthat thethe collaboration basically that we haveis thatum you know companies and people likeyourself Building Products on top ofsomething like leviate right so whetherit's part of the the stack of the uh ofthe um of the uh the the the secretSouls I I guess right the um theum what I find interesting is thedifference in the model betweenum language understanding and havinginformation or producing information andknowledge and what I mean with that isthe following it's like you have likethese these statistics right where itsays like that like I don't know like 98or something of data is you know isbehind closed doors and the rest is isout in the public so you could look atthese models that are being trainedaside from the perspective like are theyable to parse the question the thenatural language questionand if we can get them good enoughto know where they need to find theinformation in this case from the factordatabasethen I think that's more powerful thanadding the knowledge itself to the modelbecause the problem is that if you keepadding the knowledge to the model thenyou need to keep fine-tuning them allkeep updating it but let's say thatum let's say that the modeldoes not know just for the sake ofargument what what deviate is rightum or no actually an even better exampleis something where time plays a role soum well I saw here in the back I havelike I've hit the Angelo record right solet's say that tomorrow all of a suddenhe would release a new record and Iwould ask the model what's the latestthe Angelo record right then it wouldgive methe wrong answer because the trainingdata of course you know had like thatlatest that latest record I think what'svery interesting is that and that's alsowhat we now see with a gbt chat or chatgbt I always forget what way around itis but thethank you is that theumis that sometimes it also responds likeI have no connection to the internetand that is something that I find superinteresting because what you then can dois that if you can ask a question likeokaywhat's in this very specific example wasthe Angelus latest recordand it can parse that query and thenbasically ask the vector database likehey wait a secondtell me something about you know therepresentations for like the Angelorecords and those kind of things and itgets back a top 10 resultand then it parses the results andReturns the answer then that means youcan keep updating the databaseand getting these ends back and what Ifind very interesting for for companieslike you like yourself is like goingback to that numberuh a a a a 98 of of data is isum you know behind closed doors so inthe example that you gave about thegreen card maybe that's a beautifulbusiness for you know for you to sell tolaw firms where you can say hey if youhave specific data internally that couldanswer these kind of questionsautomatically then you're you're cuttingout the middleman to answer these kindof questionsincentive structure yeah exactlyum we even hope to do that with uh withgovernment agencies you helped offloaduma lot of the work from County clerks forexamplehundreds of emails and phone calls foreven the smallest of counties uh thatcould be answered using this and alsohelp expose data exactly the 98 behindclosed doors is a good is a good topicbecause there is especially withessential local information ingovernment and municipalities there isso much behind closed doors uh we hopeto to point this at those data sourcesand really expose it but it isinteresting I mean it is such alimitation of models that the Corpus youknow chat GPT I believe is up to 2021July 2021 so anything temporal thathappened since then uh just uh doesn'texistum it's an opportunity for us yeah theyfor some reason they won't connect it tothe internet but we're happy tooptions right so you have like you havelike connecting to the internet but youalso have the opportunity touh enrich it with very specific yeahBill and knowledge base andand what is what is super exciting andwe see that in action also because ofthe things that for example what youguys are building is thethat that we're that we're starting tomovetowards this uh um this this naturallanguage interaction with thesedatabases or these these data and thereason I find it so interesting was thatone of the early ideas or like thethings that sparked also the idea forforum uh for for viviate was that theum I was very into this into thesemantic web rightand the problem was that we neededhumans to agree on you know nouns andthose kind of words you know in advanceto describe things and that simplydidn't workright so you get like these noun listsand these keyword lists and those kindof things and thenthese um being able to having a uhum a conversation like we're having nowin a certain context that I think thesethese these Vector searchings were likea well actually the models first ofcourse and then out of that gameum the the idea to store the informationbut that you could actually start tointeract with these systemsand then now what you're describing islike a a third step so but if you canreally interpret what somebody is askingor even keep context and what people areaskingand then send it back to the database sothe option it just keeps keeps it justkeeps growingyeahjust to build off a little bit whatyou're saying Bobum there is definitely a capabilityoverhang when it comes to large languagemodels what we currently have is waymore capable than what we are able to totease out of it now but and I thinkthat's because like you said we keep onfalling back to what's worked in thepast which is more data during trainingand maybe that's not it maybe actuallythese large language models are capableenough that if we put them into designedsystems we can get them to do thingsthat they would never be able to dootherwise like when it comes to Mariannebeing able to answer the give you theright answer faster uh right or or youknow when we think about helping Countyoffices deal with all this uh all thesequestions pointing them in the rightdirection well none of that's usingfancy you know state-of-the-art largeit's not using uh 500 billion uhparameter models it's it's DaVinci 2 butused in uh in in maybe a correct wayright it often reminds me of theintroduction of electricity uh in Londonuh for the factories it actually took 10years before uh efficiency numbersprofitability went up because whenpeople first started using electricitythey were just using it in the way thatthey used to use Steam and actually allof the benefit comes from now you canreposition the Machinery because youdon't have to deal with steam pipes uhdelivering power you just have thesethese cables so uh we're in a similarsituation I think with large languagemodels and it's part of the reason why Ithink it's coming way faster than we canimagine because really what's holding usback is just the eyes the spark thespark of imagination to to put algorithmdown that's uh able to handle situationsas they come and then when it maybeunderstands what it it knows what itdoesn't know and then search for that uhto try to fill in the gaps yeah I know Ilike I like this very much and I I thinksoum I think a lot of what a lot of peopleliked about the model was like theanswers that it was producing sometimeslike funny or sometimes it was like uhyou know the correct answer sometimeswrong answers butum what actually was exciting to me whenI saw it was that it was parsing thequestionso it was like and and the moment I sawthis parsing my question I didn't careanymore this would give me the rightanswer or not because then because I wasthinking I was thinking about that 98right so I started thinking like if itcan parse that questionthan with um on the infrastructure levelthe um the the database but like on a onan application Level which you guys arebuilding is like there's so muchopportunity now in in literally everyevery industry so it's funny it'ssometimes when I talk to people and thensometimes when I'm like at a party orsomething right so peopleum who might not necessarily listen toeffective search related podcasts so soand they think so what do you do andthen explain what they do it's like I'min Search and sometimes people go likewe need search and you're like what doyou mean we need search everybody and Iam more and more starting to understandlike people are people are unaware thatif they for example type something in inum in such a chat windowthere is a search happening in thatknowledge base it's everything a searchso if you really can take that next stepin in[Music]umstoring the information in a way that itcan be processed but also parsing theinformation to the models that'ssuper powerful super powerfulyeah and then that's where you knowVector search is is so great tounderstand the meaning of that searchand match that with the text that we'repulling from various places and justjoining joining those meetings I mean itwould not be possible without Vectorsearchyeah no I I agree and I it's the it'sthe um that's sometimes when I when Italk to people is that I say like so oneupside that we have with uh with machinelearning is that in these kind ofsituations I always like to call thatthe uhum uh um a little bit tongue-in-cheek Ilike to call like the magic of machinelearning because when people see they'relike oh that's amazing it's like youknow that you do like a card trick soit's like it's like it's it's you knowin the in the you know in under the hoodit's just software doing stuff but justwhen people see it and observe it it'slike engage that it gives this part toit it feels like magic yeah exactly andexactly and I think that is what getsalso so so many people excited so thatthey're like hey but now you know if Ican really start to interact with thesystems and when I say interact I don'teven meanuh uh chat based interact butnatural language a language based formof interacting I think that is sobecause we we keep on because it's thestatus quo right but we keepunderestimating how incredibly difficultit isto turn a searchlike a question that an end user hasinto a query if we don't exactly knowwhat they're looking for that is that isextremely hard so these models helpingum uh um in in in translating the thethe natural language questions uh tostructured questions that we can youknow query databases and get theseresults back yeah that's super powerfulsuper powerfulgiving a semantic understanding of thosequestions of of that question regardlessof how the user has maybe typed it or uhbeing able to ask follow-up questionswhen when it's unclear about the and andthat's surprisingly not that difficultto do with these uh current systems aslong as you're you're halfway decent atprompting uh you can build thesefollow-up systems and train them overthe course of a couple thousand examplesto perform really really well at leastto cover 90 uh 95 of uh questions thatyou might getumexactly and I find it very interestingbecause nowadays you sometimes see theseum uh these interviews on like theseYouTube channels like with like languagephilosophers and those kind of thingsand there's also kind of like often youknow interest of mine and um and thenthese these these uh philosophers alwaysyou know they make sure that everybodyunderstand that the machine does nothave semantic understanding of whatsomething means but from my perspectiveI look at this very different because Iunderstand I I get you know wherethey're coming from but the point isjust being able to parse the questionright and and put that into context andthen know from what you know where inthis case in Vector space where thecontext is stored as you can retrievethat information what we you know in theindustry I guess call semantic searchthat is what makes it so exciting I Ireally think that even even developersright so even developers might sometimesnot be awarehow extremely hard it is to parse aquestion and to know where to find theanswer even if you have the answer soit's a very human thing right like thatmatching a question to information or atleast where to even look for thatinformation it's very human it's veryvery difficult and uh without Vectorsearch we're what back to keyword basedsearching and that just doesn't it justdoesn't workit's just not nearly as capableI wanted to have been quickly on thisidea of this conversation around notunderstanding meaning and there's thisgreat paper that went out it was calledclimbing towards nlu on meaning andunderstanding and language models andthe the picture is painted like thisthere's two people stranded on desertislands and they communicate with anunderwater cord and an octopus isintercepting the chord and it learns howto mimic the language such that it couldcut it and then talk to the other personyou know and you don't know it's octopusof the person and so that's kind of beenlike the example of the same thelanguage models are just mimicking thetext they don't act in it but I thinknow what we're seeing with chat gbt inbuilding on instruct gbt and reinforcinglearning from Human feedback is that itis embodiment because the language modelis being given some kind of instructionlikeuh write this in Shakespearean Styleand then it's predicting the tokens butthen it gets that kind of feedbacksignal so I think I think it is nowembodied and I think that kind of ideathat it doesn't have meaning orunderstanding I think that we'reactually moving past that and I thinkthis reinforcing learning from Humanfeedback idea can like it I think isbeing underappreciated like you stillsee people reacting to chat gbt likeit's just predicting the next token wellit's not it's also you know has humanslabeling how well it's following theinstructions and I think that's just asignificant differenceyou know I I I I just to add a littlebit I I maybe I don't see it as adifference at all actually then maybethat is just intelligence it's it'spicking the next right word right howhow much of really great podcasting isjust knowing what to say when rightpredicting the most effective like maybewe we have that ability internally ashumans but we're just now getting to thepoint where we we figure out how to doit with computers uh andI'd like to think that there is athe same type of intelligence that wehave for natural language processingthey are gaining like at least uhthe abilityumandyou know it's it's trulyI think intelligent what's missing isthe persistence aspect of it like theproblem is none of these systemspersistently exist over days weeksmonths years and so have no ability toto uh form like long-term memories andand I think that's when we would startto be wonder whether or not they trulyare intelligent when they have thatpersistence so they're sort of like atcall right now and only exist for ashort time before they're you knowscrubbed and then like refresh somewhereelse again I think that goes back to thedatabases website would come in uhbecause the vector databases is thatpersistent yeah Vector search is thatpersistence and what is intelligence butbeing able to do the next right thingbased on your associations that you'velearned yeah uh and what is you know theassociation it enables thoseassociations it really is powering thoseintelligent systemsyeah and I I quickly I I quickly want togoum uh back to what Connor said becausewhat I find what I what I findinteresting is like I strongly believethat we make these systemsfor humans right so we make it for eachother to help each other right that isthat is that is what that's why we buildthese systemsso if somebody says well you know thething is just doing is predicting youknow the right token or if somebody saysoh you know in effective database you'rejust doing like a distance calculationfrom one to another sure but that's nowI mean we now have like the uh the thethe the the the soccer championshiphappening right so it's actually that'sthe same thing that if somebody scores abeautiful goal that you say oh there wasjust a signal sent from the brain youknow to his feet and you know they hadto kick the ball yeah that's true butthat's I kind of uh that defeats thepoint of for what it's doing right it'screating and sending value in the caseof soccer I guess like entertainmentvalue and and in the um in in in the inthe case of vector database it's likeit's a information retrieval value rightso the two use cases for example thatyou guys mentioned in the beginning sofor me those kind of arguments like ohyeah it's just you know predicting thenext token I'd app that I just I it goesin here and goes out there because I waslike you know who cares it's starting toadd value to uh to people's lives andwe just know that it's gone it's amatter of timebefore people we will hear the storiesthat people say like oh thanks to thesesystems I could you know I was able todo X thanks to these systems I was ableto do why that is it's already happeningbut that's just gonna be more exactlyit's already happeningyeah I think it'sum and again what chat GPT I think hasdone is brought it to people's attentionmore quickly I think what we've you knowpeople in the industry have maybe seenthis coming uh for several months andexperience but now it's bringing it tothe masses and people are just realizingand I think quickly or going or alreadyusing it to help them in in day-to-daytasks and it is adding value from thethe programmer to the uh the studentumit has so but really excited to see nowwith more companies doing what we'redoing is integrating it as part of abigger systemyeah and what I find interesting andthat is just a uh um and I saw somebodytweeted this but I I forgot who I Iforgot who sent out this tweet but thething is like we're spending so muchtime right so we're making these boughtgas to talk about it we have or we havethe academic research we have the blogswe have like and everybody's doing thatstuff throwing it into the outside worldand then it just takes an input uh uhyou know an input box on a website wherepeople can just type it in and I foundthat fascinating goes for for you guysas well I remember that you had thefirst tweet uh I think there was alsotweeters like you know people cannot tryit out and yet like the the link and youcan could ask a few questions and I waslike super exciting to see and peoplewere actually trying it out and and andand testing it so I was like oh this isIt's just sometimes it's so interestingso sometimes something is like in theair and people go like you know we'regoing to get it but nah not completelyand then it's just an input box and itdoesn't matter if it's you guys doing itor or opening eye doing it justthe people you can type something in andthat they just get a response back and Iwas and I thought I was like I had tolaugh about it because we're spending somuch time making content and explainingto people this is what's happening onthe hoot and those kind of things andthen it just took an input box forpeople to fill something like oh now Iget it[Laughter]yes yes yes yeah yeah that's actually Ilike that so it's like it's it would bethe same as likeum like if you see like you know an amagician who would start off by you knowtelling how uh how he or she's gonnamake an elephant disappear right youjust you don't care you just want to seein Heavenly basically yeah interestingso so I'm curious I'm curious to hearwhat what kind of what you guys thinkthat you might see happening becausewhat's very interesting for for somebodylike like myself right it's like theum in our case we're like aninfrastructure database provider thathelps you know in this stackum and and these types of applicationsthat your building is like amazingbecause that brings it really into thehands of of ofum you know like literally everybodyright so just to the the the non-so fairfolks if you will and I'm just I'm justcurious where you think so if you justdream a little bit about like what youthink that will be happening in the inthe near future what if you have toguess what what do you think that theywill see in in the coming yearI mean if you want to go first sureright we'vewe've pondered this a lot um and it'sthings are moving so quickly uh muchfaster than I think anyone even expectedand it's only going to continue to uhgrow more exponentiallyumI don't I don't think people are used tonatural language uh questions asking andgetting natural language answers yetuh because it just that's not how peoplenecessarily necessarily search on Googleand to be honest Alexa in Siri which arepeople's uh you know General interactionwith that is not very good uh at thoseanswers uh you know they're kind ofglorified clock timers and and weatheruh and they can tell you the weather butas far as you know actually answeringlike we're seeing Marianne or Chet GPTthey're not there so I don't thinkpeople have gotten used to this formatyet uh and once they realize that theythey canum this is how we normally talk this ishow we normally ask things so I thinkwe'll go back to to speaking like thiswhere I think eventually it will go uhpossibly an always-on type of digitalassistant uh that's listening to yourconversation uh and inserting itself anadding value where when it thinks youmight need to know something when youmight have a question uh somewhat likethe old Sci-Fi movies where you wake upand you're speaking to the roombecause I don't think the input box isgoing to be is the most efficientinterface anymore and I think thecapabilities of this and are just sogreat that now we're now we can go therenow we can enable systems like thiseventuallyyou know from my end I I have thought alot about this and I think uh chat GPTum was really a watershed moment like Ikeep on thinking back to the movieInterstellar when they are on the planthe water planetuh and then they see uh what looks likemountains in the background and like ohmountains that's so crazy and then theylook behind themselves and they just seelike a towering wave coming for them Ivery much feel like we're at that pointum and the easiest way for me to try toconceptualize it is I I agree with Marcothere's persistence in these agentsum that are going to be a thing uh andsowhat does the world look like whenthere's a trillion people in it and 99of them are Flesh and Bones and the restof them are like digital intelligentagents going around what's that worldlook like I have no idea you know it'sjust it's it's it'sit's it's I think it's coming very veryshortly like in the next two to four tofive years we're gonna have agents thatarepersistent uh that can travel and decidewhat to work on and do andI just I don't I I guess I should getused to saying please and thank you toto my digital assistants because theymight I don't want to piss them off whenthey become sentientyeahno but that that's that's super that'ssuper interesting and I I think so ofcourseum what we sometimes keep forgetting isthat language is justthat's just a form right so we can weyou can tokenize like kinda everythingright so think about like games orum uh or or like I don't know labAssistance or something right where youcan choose alsoum uh store or predict you know certaintypes of behaviors and those kind ofthings so I think that's that's gonna bethat that's gonna be coming as well andwhich is not per se driven throughum uh true language so I find that justit's just you know or degenerative forthose kind of things so I find that thatis very exciting as well it's uhum I'm also what I also find interestingbecause I what I really like you guystook like like also a little bit likethe Long View although that in in in ourworld of course the Longview is likesoon but I think also if you look atlike tomorrow for example just to bepregnant is itum I'm also very curious to see howumhow one people will integrate this intoexisting businesses so I'm thinking forexample about like um ticket systems orthose kind of things so when I have likethe airline I want to ask a questionlike why where's my luggage you knowthose kind of things that they that youcan figure it out in in an NLP fashionbut even what I'm more interested in islike new businesses that we will see sopeople can build new things on thesesystems like like completely newproducts new servicesum uh on top of thesis and I'm lookingvery much forward toum uh uh to to see what's happeningthere right so I saw for exampleum uh recently I saw there was a therewasn't based on the generative modelwhere you had certain voices of uhfamous actors and there's like a startupand that they say well rather thanactually hiring the actorall right she just give us the text andwhen we have the the actor you knowum uh um you know say the lines but thecool thing is that that's a new businessopportunity also for these creativeslike these actors right because yes theynow don't have to do like the like theone recording but they can do likehundreds or thousands recordingssimultaneously why while you know theycan see they can skill that so I alsothink so for example I think also forthe creative industry so this is goingto be great because of course you knowsome people are a little bit scared Etcbut that's fine but I actually thinkit's going to help people in um beingmore creative and make moreum uh do it faster so that you can justhave a higher output of quality soall these kind of businessesfrom from from a generative like likelike language integrating it with thedatabase you get the right informationout but also forbasically any creative process thatwe're doing as humans and I regardlessif you're creative as like as like adoctor or like a visual artist I Ithink we're going to see a lot of newbusinesses pop up based on these kind ofmodelswe're kind of that chain of like theunderstanding of what somebody meansplus the information retrieval plus theinformation storageit's kind of it what I like was likealso the analogy of the wave rightbecauseall of a sudden the puzzle seems to becompleted from the beginning to the endright and then all of a sudden all thoseideas start streaming and people startto build new things and that's somethingthey're super excited aboutjust you know it you you talked aboutcreativity uh and I actually work withanother company that is using this toturn natural language questions aboutdata into data visualizations and pythoncode that collects the data from yourspecific uh data Escape so it's it itit's coming and it's it's so it's sofast uh to build too if you know if youhave the experience with these largelanguage models you can spin somethingup pretty quick that covers 80 it's onlya perfect MVP tool yeah it just launchedthese things but I I also agree I thinkit's going to affect every business inevery industry I think uh it's not justso many new businesses that will becoming so many new businesses thator current businesses that are almostobsolete as well and new businesses toreplace them uh if they don't adapt andstart uh utilizing some of these toolsbut uh I think you're right Bob the thepuzzle Has Come Together between Vectorsearch these foundational models uhreally the the elements are there tobuild these systems and it's a veryexciting time to be a part of it thatfeels really transformational yeahyeah I I agree I agree and that isthat's great and I think one thing tobuild on top of also something thatConnor said about that research there'sthere's this other research paper I needto I need to look it up because it'slike I I don't know about heart but it'sit's actually a pretty old paper wherethey where they make an argumentum so they have like this this thoughtexperiment where they're saying okay youhave two people right one person is justum you know completely healthy butsomebody else is like you know it'smaybe like starting to forget certainthings right and you both test them withwalking from the same you know point toum in a city to for example Museumthe first person just you tell them okayStraight Ahead left left right Etc andthen you're at the Museum but the otherperson who keeps forgetting you givethem aum a note and the note just says okayyou're on your way to the museum go youknow left left right left right thenyou're at the Museum and what the whattheum that paper is arguing so the questionthat's being asked in the paper is likewould it be fair to say that this noteor this notebook is an extension of thebrainbecause theumcan we can we can we make that claim andthen the paper argues yes you can makethat claim so for example if you want toremember somebody's phone number back inthe day right you wrote it downthere's kind of an extension of yourbrain outside and you just you know youread it and then you have thatinformation and then that experiment orsorry that that thought experiment isredonebased on search online so can we makethe argument that search online uhextends the extents of the brain andthen they come to the same conclusionwe're saying yes we think that you canmake that argument because if you justyou know don't know in what year theEiffel Tower is built you know you justin today you you Google it or nowadays Iguess you would ask exactlyand um and and get the um and get theanswer and I thinkso what we're doing is like we're we'recreating these systems to extend likethis Collective brain not only withpublic information but also informationthat you know that might be behindclosed or just imagine that you havesuch an integration with your with yourbank right so you might ask a questionabout like you know where about certainyou know clothes or something that youlike and then it interacts itautomatically interface with your bankand it's just like okay you know youcould go to the store but bear in mindyou know you don't you don't you don'thave enough money in your bank accountthose kind of things that itintelligently starts to make thoseconnectionsthat is what it's enabling and I and andthat goes back to what I said earlierabout the semantic web that it I thinkit wasgenerally speaking underestimated in theindustryhow big of a problem it was that we ashumans needed to make these connectionsinside the databasesand that we now not have to do thatanymorecreates this whole stream all the way tothe previous argument that was my storythat was 10 like okay so now we canstart to extend that Collective brainbecause it starts to make thoseconnections automatically and I stronglybelieve that so it's like a uhum and and yesa factor search plays a role in that themodels play a role in that but also whatyou're building with Marianne Ryan sothat you say okay so this is an exampleof such an application that people canuse on a day-to-day basis so it's justthe the explosion of creativity comingout of this is super exciting to meyeah I think I think we don't evenrealize how smart we can be also andkind of on this user interface is onething I kind of want to bring up thismultimodal idea and I saw this one demofrom anthropic or Adept I always mix upthe companies and I'm sorry fans butwhat it is is it's like recording yourscreen so you say to gbt like I'm tryingto import one million data objects toweviate and then it'll watch my screenit'll watch me like get going myterminal download the docker composer towatch me interacting with the web andthen it would like suggest things on theside so it's it's kind of like adifferent interface compared to whereyou talk about the data visualizationand you imagine like okay I got thismatplotlib error so now I need to copyand paste everything give it to the chatwindow compared to something that's likealways watching you doing your taskexactly I think that always on typeproactive assistant uh to maybe deliverthe results versus waiting for you toask for it yeah you've got to think fromuh computational uh efficient energyenergy efficient standpoint what what isbetter the specific tool that runs onveryvery low cost hardware and softwareversus uh an adapt like tool that youknow you have to push 1080p video to asystem embed it what's going to win outin that situation well I think the forpeople who can afford it uh thealways-on everything assistant is goingto be the thing to do but you might needthe best hardware on the planet to runit right you might need to have theknowledge and capabilities oflaunching a server with a couple gpus inorder to get it goingand at that point maybe maybe it doesmake more sense to go to thatspecialized tool that just turns my myPro I understand I need a data sciencething I'll go to the data science tooland then uh work with that in order toreduce the cost I mean it's it's goingto be a very interesting landscape of Idon't think I think the theI think the obvious or the first thingto think about is like there's going tobe like one winner take all but I thinkbecause of the the hardware constraintson on these systems there's gonna beplenty of room forthe more specialized low-cost Tool uh inin that new landscape so don't know andwe were just talking about thisyesterday about what's going to win islike does facts have a chance you knowkids are going to survive when you knowGTP 4 and chat GTP 4 come out I thinkprobably at least for the the next fiveyears yeah for sure uh there's gonna bethat uh especially if we partner withlike organizations that are going toexist despite the introduction of AI uhlike governments or Community localcommunities like integrating directlywith them and helping them liketransition and and start using thesetools in a way helpful for them yep andsolves their their everyday problemsum not everyone's a coder right sono no exactly but I think so they'relike I if I may I would like to unpacktwo things about what you're sayingbecause that something that I find veryinteresting is theumso so two things so the first thing islike the umso so my my work is right so I'm like inin in software business right thatthat's what I do and that's that's how Imake for since forever a living and theum and and I'm always very interested intheseum these laws right that start to appearlike hey you have like uh you knowconways all those kind of things sothey're they're things we're learningabout what software is doing andand one of these these laws is thatum and it does not per se from digitalbusiness but it's like it's something weespecially see in digital business islike that um uh the solution that thatbrings the the less the the least amountof friction is something that peopleum are willing to to use and and even ifso if they get enough value from itthey're fine you know to just you knowum look away with certain you knowsituations like for example with likenow with with all the the chatapplications or these always onsituations where you might like you knowmaybeum uh um you know I don't know whetherthe information is going where thatinformation is being stored but it givesme so much value that I'm willing thatI'm willing to do that I think a um notnot to divert Too Much from the from thefrom the subject matter but just to makemy point is the I always found it veryinteresting with like everything that'shappening also like in cryptocurrencyright so because that's also that's likeoutside of my realm of expertise but ithappens also in business and what I findfascinating that the claim was like okayyou're gonna have a private keybut these things are hard to use so nowyou get like digital Banks right thatstore that informationandI think the same thing is like withum what you guys are building withMarianne or if that's likeum the these these screen capturingtools Etc thatso much value is being created forpeople the people like I want this rightI need this in my life because it'shelping me so that is the first thingright so that I think that we now wewe're past that pointwhere so much value is being createdthat people like okaygive it to me right I want this I wantto I want to be able to use this becausethe ux is just great and the secondthing that I find uh very interesting isthat I thinklike these winner take alluh uhbusinesses that just that just not a lotof them right so and especially also inyour domain and what you're doing whatyou just said right so because yes so wenow keepreferencing for example the models thatopenai has but let's not forget a lot ofthese similar open source models thatare being produced right we should notforget that so if you're like agovernment agency and that for for agood reason it's like we would love tohave such a service but you knowunfortunately we you know we can't use athird-party service or something likethat then there are like solutions forthat as well so it's like a there's andand it's fine because you know there'sso much value being created by so manypeople for so many people that I thinkuh uh that we will not seeum uh last companies I think we shouldwe will see morelet me see look at so I recently saw alist of companies that just now havegenerative Services right so that yousaid okay write me a LinkedIn post forumyou know something I want to sell and uhand I was just surprised about theamount of companies that not our onlyfound it to solve this but they'reactually also finding niches and beingprofitable and successful in thesenichesit's just we're just scratching thesurface I really believe thatyeah I agree I think the niche focusingon the niches is uh there's so muchdetail in minutia inwhen you get into any industry uhthere's always going to be opportunityto really better solve that specificproblemum and now and people have the tools todo so now yeahyeah you know it makes you think alsomaybe maybe actually that that winnertake all business is just the the onethat can turn a natural language promptinto like pointing to the right Nicheservice that can best solve that thatspecific promptum I mean it's very interesting just Iwant to touch base a little bit what yousaid earlier because I think itresonates with what we've experienced isthat we've started with GTP and da Vinciuh and the new instruct uh GTP but thenwhat we find is uh actually we once weget enough uh usage on our product thenwe have all the data we need to trainour own open source fine tune our ownopen source models and just hop off ofuh the GPT uh ecosystem at least untilthe next best thing comes along and wewe figure out how to do that really welland rebuild our examples and thenfine-tune our our own system so it's youknow there is definitely ways for peopletoto grow and get value from using a thirdparty like uh cohere or open and I wantto give some some love to the otherpeople the other companies in the roomas well uh can't wait till adapt uhAdept releases uh if anyone here is uhworking on adapt uh please hit us up andlet us get some access to the API we'dlove to toum use it to help make people's liveseasier uh in terms of actually doing theactions like hey can you apply for agreen card for me and my wife all rightdepth to take it away and that's what'scoming next uh is actually you know nowwe're helping people find the rightanswer faster yeahum next up we will also be using we V8to help suggest services and programsand resources that might apply to peopleas we understand more about that personone of the big problemsum in this country and I'm sureeverywhere is under utilization of theseprograms and services people mightqualify for certain things or might uhthere's one of the things I discovereduhbuilding this business so far is howmuch free tutoring there is for childrenall across country in real time we cango online and find free tutors to helpyou with Calculus right now someone'ssitting there open and willingum and so you know I had no idea and uhthat's just a basic example but you knowhelping people with heating billshelping people qualify for freeBroadband uh so suggesting thoseprograms and then next up is helpingpeople actually complete those actionsuh take advantage of them uh which is II like the example that buyer interestsuse when we got a demo abbreviate and hewas like I'm hungry and then we wereable to serve food banks in the localarea and that's what we want to get towe want to be like hey bring us yourneeds your problems that you're havingand we'll help you get connected to notwhat the Nationwide that but the yourlocal essential uh ecosystem what existswhere you are at because that's theprobably the best place for you to getthe help that you need uh get thesupportum and that's what we're really tryingto build you know I think you said itearlier it started with the wildfire andlike getting the most useful and localinformation but I mean there's just somuch that people don't realize that'sout there in terms of resources andthings you could accomplish and the thethe issues that people just don't knowwhat they don't know and the problem iscreation yeah curation there's so muchout there it's hard to find what you'relooking for it's a needle in a haystacksometime and that again yeah who whoknows the very specific local name ofthe program that's going to help you youjust have a problem you've got todescribe that problem and get you knowhopefully get surface the right uhinformation or program for your for yourspecific problem that situationyeah and that's very interesting and Inow when you're when you're giving theseexamples I'm also thinking likethese um we're now very much talkingabout like how we use these models atquery time because all these examplesyou give like they're like at query timedo somethingum uh what I think is is going to bevery interesting to seeif these models can help in structuringthe information when we when we createthe information right so that could beand I'm I'm now just from the top of myhead right so an idea might be like ifyou store information aboutum well the the examples food banks on awebsite that the model says well if youstructure like this it's easier toprocess or it's easier to get access toso they were not only solving theproblem unlike in on a query on queryperspective but also on and from from aninput perspective right or maybe eventhen it can even help with generatingthat kind of uh pure kind of contentI think we're already using it yeahyou're speaking to the choir yeah we'rewe're we'realready using it we're using AI to helpus one of the problems again is there'sso much information out there there's somany links and phone numbers which isright which is correct which is relevantwhich is which is essential uh so wehave in part of our pipeline we're uhWe've trained a model to help usdetermine if something is essential ornot so it's already helping us uh youknow filter down and uh structure thedata better on that that's that's alittle bit farther away from the queryside but even even go farther away uh wetake the these verified facts and weproduce content with them we producelocal news summaries we produce uh factsyou know question answer pairs that arein human language and they're easy tosearch using your current channels likeGoogle uh We've even talked aboutstarting to publish these things onTwitter accounts like a local a localessential new uh news information youcan follow and and find all of theseinteresting if we surface all sorts ofstuff I mean anything you can think ofthere's usually someone in yourcommunity that's helping that's that'sthere to that's their job that's that'swhat they do and they help and they it'sjust so hard to find uh so we have beendoing it we just published another 40000 facts uh on on facts yesterday andwe'll be there's no reason why wecouldn't do that uh you know a hundredthousand times every every week for thenext next couple weeks it's just thatpowerfuland I have a question so I so now thisis very intriguing right so in in thebeginning of this conversation youtalked about like the the the the thesecret Souls right so soum so if is there something in the soulsthat you can just share with us whereyou go like well if we look at the codebaseoh there's this there's one thing thisone one ingredient in the whole saucelike without giving the sauce how youmix but like this one ingredient inthere we go like we're so proud of thatwe're so proud of that wow I thinkthere's a is there one I mean you canyou can speak to that I think what I'mproud of is the the human verificationaspect and the fact that we've gottenyou know at this point over 12 000people contributing to uh to sourcingand validating uh these facts so reallythe the humanI don't want to forget about humans inthis process too because AI is betterwith humans uh humans plus AI makes itmakes all the output better uh and thatreally is that that virtuous Loop rightthat that flywheelum but as far as our secret you knowaside from the I think so I think that'sthat's a big part of uh our product andthenthat's a that's a really interestingquestion I likeI think we need more prompt space forsure I need more prompt space I need uhway more prompt space because more con Iwas finally it's interesting and thenjust the side part here but I find thatwords in prompt space almost act likepointersso if you use more words in the Targetarea that you're trying to answer foryou get better resultsdon't quite understand what the dynamicor like what might be causing that withthe dynamic how to explain it or even ifthere's a word to describe thatphenomena butI think it's important likemore prompt space more examples morecontextuh exactly isn't the word contextit's called yeah it's it's contextyou're absolutely right it is contextthe more context I can fit within thatprompt the better the answer is oh isgoing to be always more examples of likegood quality exactly you know that thatreally is I think where I could getwhere personally with the current uhalgorithm how it's set up get the mostbang for my buck but I do seeum like algorithmic Innovation beingsuper important like I can't we quitequite like it's hard to get the model toto understand what it doesn't understandlike if we could if if I could get thatthe system to display that quality Ithink we would be at a point where Icould just let it run consistently andsee see what happens like I there's justa lot to do I I really these intelligentit's we have a new paradigm it's not aVon Neumann machine it's something elsethey uh and we don't know how we don'tquite know what how to put these thingstogether in order to build like the CPUof the large language model error youknow like but I think it's there I thinkit's there for the picking like ithasn't really been discovered Deep Mindfor all it's amazingness hasn't hasn'tquite cracked that code yet but you justsaid something that really triggered meit's like I was like that's like becausewe were just talking about like you knowall these business ideas then that thenstartup ideas ever come from this I justthe the word that just popped into mymind when you were describing everythingabout context was like fingerprinting solet's say that you just let's say thatyou have like um the the the always onsystem right so that keeps givingcontext to the model of like who I amcan be in natural language can be in howI my screen recording and I say okay nowwe have like a fingerprint of you knowwho Bob isso now I might go to uh um to useMarianne in my government situation Ican't give it access to public web but Idon't mind feeling it my fingerprint sothat it's like boom it has my contactslike oh okay oh so this is this guyright so and it knows what you need yesit's almost there's there's like anembedding exchange like if it was easierfor everyone to to share the userembeddings generated in that specificcontext or give access to that uhcontext for the user to then bring toother services probably something thatprobably a really really interestingbusiness right thereor just imagine that you that yousubscribe to like to Netflix right andthen rather than say like what movies doyou like say okay just upload your youknow your embeddings fingerprint yeahyou're embedding yeah at my Googlesearch history yeah done now Iunderstand that's what I like yeah whatI find interesting about the about theabout the embeddings is that it's it'ssoum if if I go into a bar and have aconversation with somebody I've neverseen right then you have a conversationand a little bit of context is goingback and forth to figure out like okayis do I have a connection with thisperson right is it interesting to have aconversation aboutyou know whateverum I don't have to show this person myGoogle search history for this person togo like oh this is an interesting personto talk to like oh no I'm not gonna justapproach this person you knowum so and that is I think what thesewhat these these these fingerprintscould do is theum uh is that you basically can say okaywait a seconduh it's a way without like giving allthat information about myself right justmore like I have a a representation ofme basically in in in Vector space ifyou will yeahyeah I mean it's just it's it's a datingapp for those embedding is what you'redescribing even you know uh it's veryinteresting it's good too because it'sactually privacy preserving it's rightit's the only information you'retransmitting is your relationship withthat with that user base in in thatservice you're not you're not actuallyshowing them your Google searches uhsearch uh files just how similar youreyes to uh one user or the other uhwhich I think is another really greatthing because it's a lot in terms ofmental barrier I know I don't feel badabout sharing I would feel bad aboutsharing uh my Google search my entireGoogle search history to to everyone butjust the embedding this this you know256 long long character string boom easyyeah and I think that might actually belike a nice uh even like a nice uhuh uh like a conclusion of this of thisconversation right where we say likeokay theseumwe weit's like over that Tipping Point onmultiple levels where people where it'slike good enough to give people theright valueandthe way that the information is storedand the way that we current informationisso radically different from how we'redoing that you know in like five yearsago and before that the amount ofopportunities for people to build newprojects make new models build newstartups build new businesses helppeople right doing new stuff is thisthis is going to be tremendous it's likeit's a uh it's it's it's super excitingit's really cool it's really coolit's uh really good that we're we'repart of it actually I'm I'd like I'mreally glad it's kind of scary at thesame time with how everything ishappening but been really really happythat we're actually here and and I thinkthe the problem that we're trying toattack is a really good one too and onethat would often be ignored I mean yousee how popular stable diffusion isum but not quite uh how popular tryingto solve the local every day yeahexactlyum no it's uh and it's been greatworking with you guys thank you for thesupport as well we've uh we couldn'thave done built this with without webeumit's and to Echo what Chris said itreally is an exciting time theit's amazing what's coming out everyevery day it seems like uh every otherweekum and uh it's great to be a part of itit's great to to use it to solve realworld problems uh for real people uh wejust excited to see what comes nextexcited to be in the space and and uhand just be a part you know atransformational time in history Ibelieve it's fantastic to see what youguys have been and it's it's just it'sfantastic it's just awesome and Iremember that I tried it out I was likeon our on our slack Channel that I waslike oh this is awesomethank you thank you very much yeah wellwell Bob will look we look forward tosetting Mary up uh Marianne up for uh weV8 to answer some developer questions Iknow I know the slack can get kind ofcrowded with all the questions that youguys get uh maybe we can just hook up toyour documentation and the the issuetickets uh on GitHub and sort ofautomate 90 of your workthat that would be nice if you canautomate my work so and that's the greatthat would be great so thank you so muchguysthank you thank you for having us on", "type": "Video", "name": "Bob van Luijt, Chris Dossman and Marco
