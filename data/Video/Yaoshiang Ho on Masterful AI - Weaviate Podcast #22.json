{"text": "Thank you so much for watching the 22nd Weaviate Podcast with Yaoshiang Ho! Yaoshiang is a Co-Founder of Masterful AI, ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nchecking out the wva podcast today is \ngoing to be another super exciting \nepisode we have yao shang ho from \nmasterful ai uh masterful ai from my \nfirst impression of it looks like this \nsuper interesting model training and \ndeployment computer vision software and \ni'm super excited to just dive into the \ndetails and get right into it so uh yash \nand thank thank you so much for coming \non the podcast and can you tell us about \nmasterful ai yeah absolutely glad to be \nhere thanks for having me so you asked \nabout you know what we are but let me \njust let's set the stage a little bit so \nyou kind of understand the problem so \nobviously we know kind of deep learning \nbecame a big thing in the mid 2010s alex \nnet kind of groundbreaking performance \ngoogle acquires the company behind \nalexnet gets jeffrey hinton as part of \nthat deal \nand a lot of use cases have been kind of \nbeen cracked with it including then deep \nlearning also applying to nlp not just \ncv um so then kind of looking at the \ntooling a little bit um like back in the \nday you had to access gpu through \nshaders thank god at least there's like \ncuda now and then tensorflow and pytorch \nbuilt on top of it and cloud providers \noffering hardware really easily but but \nall these platforms are still really \nreally hard to use like you have to be a \ndeep learning expert and as you know it \ntakes years to become a deep learning \nexpert so you know if i would describe \nthe problem today it's sort of like \nthere's no equivalent of a mysql \ndatabase or nodejs much less a stripe or \nshopify there just aren't these like \nhigh-level services and platforms to \nsolve all your problems yeah there's \ntensorflow but it's like it's basically \nlike having to program all of those \nlibraries i just mentioned in c plus \nplus yourself just to get an application \ngoing so so let me answer your question \nyou know really directly \nmasterful uh is a platform to build \ncomputer vision models and it \nsimultaneously has a very simple \ninterface and internally it has the most \nadvanced algorithms so kind of think of \nlike when you go to aws and fire up a \nterabyte of s3 storage it's so simple \nfor you like three four clicks but you \nknow behind the scenes there's all those \nmachinery going on there's all this you \nknow hardware being procured you know \nconnections being made um \nthe advanced algorithms inside are what \nmakes it like a really ready to deliver \nproduction-ready models and i would \ncontrast that with some other automl \nplatforms um that are out there in \ncomputer vision so it's got a metal \nlearning engine it's not an \noff-the-shelf one it's one that we built \njust for our uh engine \nand what that does is it takes away a \nlot of the hyper parameter tuning that \nthe developer has to do and that's what \ndelivers on that promise that you pass \nin the data and you get them all it's \nnot you passing the data run 500 \nexperiments track them all and just sit \nand act like a human grid search \nalgorithm for you know like five weeks \nwhich is kind of how you do it today um \nit also delivers the best regularization \npolicy um regularization means um \nuh basically means getting the most \ninformation or training the most \naccurate model from your labeled \ntraining data and then on top of that it \nhas a semi supervised learning engine \nwhich means your model will get even \nmore accurate data and get even more \naccurate from the unlabeled data that \nyou pass in so that means images with no \nlabels \nthat technology is available today i \nthink you saw our technical report so \nyou saw some of the algorithms that \nwe've kind of adapted including like \nnoisy student uh barlow's twins um \nand and some clr um so that's that's \nwhat the platform is today and and you \nknow the problem is trying to solve for \nfor developers \nso so with our webv8 audience i think \nthe sim clr and barlow twins \nimplementations are just super relevant \nto what we're doing because that's where \nwe get these embedding models that \nproduce vector representations that \noptimize for semantic similarity but um \nbreaking down the things you said uh you \nknow we have and then also the \nthe meta learner the hyper parameter \nsweeping and reminiscent of things like \nweights and biases and determined ai and \nall that kind of uh user interface for \nyour model training stuff but so i'd \nlove to kind of break these things down \nand go into them one by one and i know \nthe web listeners probably want to go \ninto barlow twin sim clear first but can \nwe actually start with noisy student \nbecause i think you have some really \ninteresting perspectives on the noisy \nstudent implementation in masterful yeah \nso notice student is kind of \nconceptually drawn from a well-known \nidea of knowledge distillation which is \nlike one teaching one model generates \nsoft labels from unlabeled data and then \nthere's a noise function and then a \nstudent model gets trained as well and \nthat's kind of like the basic theory and \ni think where to contextualize it where \nnoisy student is \narguably \nadvanced and different from uh some clr \nand bar less to sort of unsupervised \ntraining techniques is um \nnoisy student i think was one of the \nfirst to prove that he worked at very \nhigh cardinality data \num whereas some of the other techniques \nwere more optimized for lower \ncardinality data sets so for example a \nlot of times like if you look at the \noriginal sim clr paper they'll use like \none percent of the image net labels \nand so you're using a much smaller \ncardinality like in the on the order of \n10 000 \nlabeled examples whereas noisy student \nwas kind of trying to prove that they \ncould do it at very large cardinalities \nso they did full imagenet 1.3 million \nimages and then used google's \nproprietary jft 300 data set with 300 \nmillion unlabeled images to then further \nshow that you can actually improve on \non \nimagenet \nsupervised training \nwithout necessarily adding additional \nmodel architecture size although that \nhelps as well \nbut you know i think one of the things i \nwant to point out since your audience \nprobably understands some unsupervised \nuh pre-training techniques like cmcr a \nlittle bit better there is a very strong \nsimilarity between these and it's not \noften thought about but in both cases \nyou are training two models kind of at \nthe same time you are noising the inputs \nbetween those two pairs of models and \nyou are trying to get them to match up \nwith each other so although noisy \nstudent often is thought of as a teacher \nand a student ultimately you are trying \nto get two models to match just like \nbarlow's just like sim clr and then the \nloss function in noisy student \nis obviously kind of you know \na weighted cross entropy whereas in sim \nclr it's contrastive and you know \nbarlows has their exotic loss which kind \nof um you know adds its own kind of uh \nvariance covariance and um \nsorry i forget the third \npart of barlow's last function but \nultimately you are trying to get two \ntwo parallel paths to take the same \nimage noise them \nand then see if they can ultimately \nmatch so they're not as different as you \nmight think is when you kind of lay them \nout side by side \nyes yeah i love that perspective of the \nsimilarity between teacher student \nknowledge distillation and then siamese \ncopies of the same network as we're \ntrying to learn \nrepresentations and then maybe just a \nquick i do think most listeners probably \nare aware of this general paradigm of \ncontrastive learning but the idea is \nthat you have a siamese copy of the \nnetwork say this is your burp model and \nthis is also that same burp model and \nthey run it and then they get the vector \nembedding vector embedding and they'll \nbe uh you you want them to align \npositive pairs and make it dissimilar to \nnegative pairs so that's kind of the \nbackground behind that idea so just to \nsort of lay the foundation a little bit \nin case we just dove right into it a \nlittle bit \nsorry about that \nthat was my fault with the way that i \nset that up but but let me um so the \nthing so noisy student for one this idea \nof high cardinality such an interesting \ninsight i'd i'd never made that \nconnection before that that i i guess i \nwasn't aware of the history of it that \nthey were trying to show that knowledge \ndistillation can work for saying a \nthousand label set i \ncould you take me a little bit through \nthat before we move on \nyeah um less about the number of labels \nabout the more about the number of \nexamples so you know as you know in \ncomputer vision the classic \ndata set 1.3 million uh examples in \nimagenet um so again just to repeat like \nthe sim clr often they'll take one \npercent of the labels and treat the \nother 99 of the images as your unlabeled \nset and so the point there is they say \nhey off of just you know 10 000 labeled \nimages we can get really really good \naccuracy \nbut we have to use you know 1.2 million \nunlabeled or draw from that pool of 1.2 \nmillion unlabeled images whereas with \nnoisy student they said we're going to \nuse all you know 1.3 million labels from \nimagenet and then we're going to take \n300 million more \nimages to use as the unlabeled \ndataset and prove that we can still \nimprove the accuracy of the model um \nthere's a talk \nthat a \nguy named godarus gave and i'll um send \nyou the link to it so you can append it \nin the show notes where he kind of \ncontextualizes just kind of where these \nkind of ideas were kind of fitting in \nwith each other and why they kind of \nwere solving slightly different problems \ni remember when i was reading simclr i'm \nlike why \nwhy does some clr use this really tiny \ndata set and why does nobody just didn't \nuse the full one you know and there is a \nlittle bit of a history and they were \ntrying to solve slightly different you \nknow slightly different nuances of the \nof the problem of ssl \nhmm wow yeah \nthank you i think that's a really \ninteresting angle to it that i hadn't \nthought about kind of the \ndirection i was i was thinking we were \ngoing to go in is talking about the the \nnoising used in noisy student and how we \nhave the augmentation and as i was going \nthrough the masterful documentation i \nsaw this thing this phrase augmentation \nclustering i read that \ni need to know what that is yeah yeah \nwell let me tell you just give you a \nvery brief history here so i mean um \nwithin uh with a noisy student there's \nthree types of noise that happen there's \njust classic data augmentation \nwhich by itself is extremely powerful \nand sufficient to make it work and they \nadd two other forms of regularization \nthat you know i'm sure everyone's aware \nof one is dropout which is classic and \nmaybe one another one that maybe is not \nas used as much as a stochastic depth um \nbut the point is um \nthat to get these techniques to work you \nhave to have the right regularization \ntechnique you cannot just throw in i'll \njust do a couple image blurs and a zoom \nand a darkening and i'm sure that'll \nwork like these techniques are very \nfragile so in a sense when you talk \nabout noisy student training people get \nexcited more by the student because it's \nkind of architecture based but that you \ncould argue the noise is at least as \nimportant um to the idea of noisy \nstudent training and what we found um in \nthe lineage of let's just take data \naugmentation is that um there's a very \nstrong sense of overfitting to imagenet \nand imagenet images all have a \nsimilarity that says that they're all \ntaken by human camera by humans holding \na camera \nwhereas a lot of other applications \ndon't have these attributes geospatial \nin manufacturing sometimes the cameras \nare very fixed sometimes they're very \nprecise sometimes you don't a satellite \ndoesn't go up and down or i guess some \ndo but a lot of satellites stay in you \nknow geostationary orbit or at least at \nthe same altitude like they have the \nsame resolution no matter if you've got \na camera pointing at a manufacturing \nline like that is it that that camera is \nnot going to move around so that's some \nof the explanation i think of why a lot \nof the classic \nideas of how to uh build a good \nregularization policy \nin my opinion are just kind of over \noverfit to imagenet so kind of the \nlineage that kind of we study and we \nmentioned this is kind of the auto \naugment and then randog and auto augment \nis a very very deep search the problem \nwith the depth of that search is it's 15 \n000 runs in their paper full training \nruns to figure out the correct policy so \nthat's obviously you know just \nintractable for any like normal \ndeveloper and then randog which i think \nis still considered state of the art \nbecause i think some clr used it um \ntried to reduce that search space by \nclustering they didn't use this term but \nif you kind of think about it that's \nwhat they did and the search space \nreduces down to about on the order of \n100 \nsearching the number of uh transforms \nand the magnitude of those transforms \nbut the insight that we had is that um \nthe way that they clustered those \ntransform magnitudes was just on a scale \nof 0 through 30 and they would basically \ntest all the transforms at level 1 all \nat level 2 all at level 3 etc and then \nall at level 30. so you know they didn't \nspecify the search algorithm \nspecifically but their point was in the \npaper um the search space is small \nenough to simply grid search so \npresumably that's the algorithm they use \n100x is still way too long for any \npractical person i mean if you're \nrenting you know \naws machine for 24 bucks an hour like \nyou know good luck telling your boss i'm \ngoing to need 100x more time you know \nlike instead of 2 000 i'm going to need \n200 000 like you know forget that that \njust that's not going to happen so what \nour insight was and it's kind of based \non um \na very very simplified version of \nuh an idea from gans which is for \ninception distance is the distance \nof something really can give you \ninsights into how much you're perturbing \nthe image so maybe darkening or \nbrightening an image by one click \nhelp affects it very little on the \ndarkness transform but maybe on the \nrotation transform it's extremely \ndestructive \nand so that means that instead of just \nsaying \ni'm going to search click one of \ndarkness and click one of rotation what \ni really should be doing is searching \nclick one of rotation and click 50 \nof darkness because they're more \nequivalent when you look at the distance \nthat the image generates so how do we \ncalculate that distance i mean you can \nhave you know your choice right you can \ndo very exotic distances you can do l2 \nof the feature maps uh another thing you \ncould do is just you know um calculate \nthe you know difference in the scalar \nlosses when you rotate an image in \nforward prop uh versus darken so that's \nhow we kind of we run forward prop to \ntry to understand how much all these \ntransforms affect the um \naffect the model perturb the model from \nsome idea of a distance from the \nunperturbed \nimages the non-noised images once you \nhave that then you can very quickly \ncluster like \nfive big clusters and then grid search \nfive clusters or three clusters instead \nof grid searching um 100 clusters so \nthat's a little bit of a nutshell and um \ni apologize we haven't quite published \nuh that algorithm in detail but uh \nthat's the kind of heart of it is \ninstead of clustering just based on some \nheuristic of you know magnitude we \nactually impute these magnitudes based \non how much it perturbs um a model's uh \nperformance on specific data \nwow that is super that is so interesting \nand i maybe i do want to kind of just \nget a couple of terms so just yes \nbecause you're so knowledgeable and i \nreally just want to dive in but i also \nwant to sort of lay the ground \ngroundwork for people listening um so \nagain a noisy student the teacher labels \nthe data for the student network to \nlearn from we're going to augment that \ndata for the student to learn from so we \nhave data augmentations like rotation \nblurring \ncropping flipping increasing making it \nmore blue than usual like there's a \nmassive set of image data augmentations \nthat are label preserving so then came \nalong the algorithm rand augment uh rand \naugment has two hyper parameters n and m \nn is uh how many to apply in sequence \nand then m is the magnitude to because \neach one has an associated magnitude \nwith say rotation you're either rotating \nat 60 degrees negative 60 degrees or say \n30 degrees right so so the the \nclustering yao shang is describing is uh \nn and m \nthey do they define a cluster in this \nspace of the massive configuration of \nthe n and the m that you could have uh \nso then for shea inception distance was \nthis thing used in gans that's like um \nyou you gans are a generative model \nbefore diffusion models kind of stole \nthe show where it's like real fake loss \nand you say how do i say that these \ngenerated images are uh quality images \nso what you do is you have the vector \nspace of the generated images \nand then you have the \nvector distance of these generated \nimages here to your original images and \nso that's that kind of foundation \nso and so now i think where we are is \nis we're looking at the vector distance \nbetween augmented images and the \noriginal images to define that \nof augmented images and and so this is \nsuper relevant for uh so noisy student \nof course so you're saying which \naugmentations should we apply to the \nimage for the teacher to label for the \nstudent but also for our general \nframework of training contrastive \nlearning models that produce like the \nvector embedding models that go into \nwev8 is \nwe have to have this algorithm where we \nstart with an image \nor any data point if we're well let's \nwe'll keep it to images because that's \nthat's like most of the label preserving \ndata augmentation research has \nbeen done on so we start with an image \nand then we're going to transform it \ninto the positive image and then align \nthose vector embeddings that's the \ntraining objective \nokay so i hope that was like a decent \nlittle like kind of uh primer to it so \nnow let's dive a little more into this \nidea of okay so we have so we're \naugmenting images and then we have \nsemantic clusters that come from the \naugmentations \nso is that i mean do do augmentations \nreally like throw off the semantic \nrepresentations so much i know that \nthere's like an issue with robustness \nwith these models where say um \nyou take your test set and if you rotate \nall the images suddenly you might go \nfrom like 90 percent to like 60 percent \nyeah so yeah in your experiments these \naugmentations they create like very \ndifferent clusters \nuh \ni'm not sure how to answer that i mean \nthe purpose of these clusters was to \ncluster all of our transforms \nby the distance or by how much it \nperturbed the model so \ni think what's interesting is \nmaybe i'll answer it this way \nif you look at a lot of research when \nthey're classifying imagenet they're \njust going to use a human prior and do a \nmirror for example but if they're \nclassifying uh mnist or svhn they're \nlike oh i shouldn't do that because \nnumbers shouldn't be horizontally \nmirrored um and \nindeed what we find is if you you know \nif you if you if you rotate the num new \nnumeral by 180 degrees or you uh mirror \nit you know models are just going to get \nreally confused by them \nuh and so you you see that reflected in \nthe amount of distance that gets come \nthat comes out when you measure you know \nthe intermediate future maps or the \nfinal value so that immediately tells \nyou that's a that's a fairly destructive \ntransformations and you know it usually \ngets excluded very quickly by the search \nalgorithm \nso i'm not sure if that's exactly what \nyou're asking but yes we we do find that \nthis approach kind of automatically \nfigures out um \nthese ideas i think another \nthing that maybe happens in geospatial a \nlittle bit is because the \nobjects are often very small i mean the \norder of you know single-digit \ndouble-digit pixels as opposed to \nimagenet \num \nthis is my hypothesis i haven't done the \nstudy to prove this but \nif you took if you rotated the image of \nme by five degrees you know you'd say oh \nthat's still me no problem \nbut when you take something that's like \nthree pixels by eight pixels and you \nrotate it you're starting to get \naliasing issues right the old computer \ngraphics idea you know you're losing \nresolution \nyou're adding blur to it and so i you \nknow what we've also found is a lot of \ntimes in geospatial images \nthese mild rotations are end up being \nvery destructive \nin a sense the more mild the worse it is \nbecause the more aliasing you induce a \n45 degree rotation is much better from a \nthan a two degree rotation i'm not gonna \ni'm not gonna prove that i don't have a \npaper to justify it we haven't done all \nthe studies but i'm just kind of giving \nyou a flavor of some of the things that \nwe've kind of observed as we try to \nexplain why our algorithm has discovered \nyou know certain made certain decisions \nabout the right policy for you know in \nthis case data augmentation and applies \nto regularization as a whole of course \nit's kind of reminding me of this idea \nof like um so out of distribution \ndetection \nand \nso using the vector representations of \nimages to determine \nthat uh we've \nso yeah so we're up in a satellite and \nwe've got uh i think you look at like \ncrops or something i'm not an expert on \nthis kind of thing but and it's rotated \nsuch that you really have it's you've \ncorrupted the label it's no longer label \npreserving so from the vector \nrepresentations of the images before and \nafter augmentation does that give us \nenough signal to \ndo out of distribution detection \nuh would i i don't know if maybe i \nshould have said out of distribution i \nshould have said just like label \ncorrupting \nyeah this idea that you've \nlost the information and you can tell \nthat purely from the vector space and \nthus you have this heuristic to say \nlet's actually not have the teacher \nlabel that for the student and noisy \nstudent is that how it comes or or when \nwe're training simclair models let's not \nmake these positives because that \naugmentation is no longer a positive \nyeah we we we we don't um \nwe don't use this technique to take \nthings out of distribution and adjust \nthe label as much as we just treat it as \na non-label preserving not sufficiently \nlabeled preserving transform and we \ndon't use it typically in um \nuh you know these regularization \npolicies you kind of have one policy and \nso you run it and the goal is that one \npolicy will sufficiently perturb the \ndata so it's not identical but it's \nstill within distributions it still you \nknow \nfeels like natural data to the model um \nif you and i eyeball it usually it looks \nlike you know relatively normal um but \nagain it's it's that's just trying to \nexplain what's kind of happening inside \num but what's happening inside is is um \nuh it's it's easy to define kind of \nmathematically but it's hard for me to \nuh to truly tell you you know why \nwhy it's working these are just sort of \nyou know my interpretations of why \ni've seen these policies come out very \ndifferently for for very different types \nof uh data sets i think the broader \npoint is that you have to be adaptive to \nthe data set and it kind of goes back to \nthe point i was saying that a lot of \nresearch is overfed to imagenet and \nimagenet you know people think it's hard \nthere are a lot of things that make it \nreally easy actually it's a balanced \ndata set for one thing there's very high \nentropy in this data set um \nit's it's it's it's it's all handheld uh \ncameras taking it so there's all these \nattributes about it that i think \nresearch is probably kind of like over \nfit to \nand you know when you try to apply any \nof these techniques out to production \ndata sets in the real world you just see \nhow it just it just doesn't work nearly \nas as well as it does on you know \nimagenet or cypher10 or something like \nthat \ncould we maybe stay i kind of want to \nexplore one more idea in the space of \nusing the vector representations and how \nthey change and i'd like to kind of \ndive into this idea of active learning \nand i think it's maybe relevant to the \nmasterful model training suite and yeah \nlearning is basically this idea where \nlet's forget randomly sampling the next \nbatch let's try to intentionally find \nthe next batch of data that would be the \nbest one to train on \nand i've seen papers like focusing on \nthe biggest losers where you say you \nknow take your batch of 64. this one had \na huge loss and so maybe you do like a \nvector search with something like we v8 \nto \nuh go get more like that because that's \nlike clearly like a weak spot in our \ndata space right have any thoughts on \nthat kind of idea yeah absolutely so \ni'll um you know it's on our product \nbacklog to \num let me step back a little bit because \na lot of our unlabeled data comes from \nvideo feeds \num the problem some of our customers \nhave is well video if you treat it as a \nsequence of frames of images you got a \nlot of it \nyou get to millions and billions of \nframes really quickly so the question \nbecomes i can't train on all of that so \nmy naive algorithm my null case would \njust be randomly sample it or uniformly \nsample it i can't sample all of it but \nlike can't we do a little bit better and \nso indeed we have done some research \ninternally on using exactly that active \nlearning ideas to say well what can i \npick off from these you know millions \nand millions of frames you know can i \nfind like the one percent that's going \nto help my model learn the most and i \nthink one of the first algorithms like a \nlot of us go towards is great we'll just \npick the one the model's wrong on that's \ngot to be the one you know to fix \num and sometimes that's right but \nsometimes that doesn't help because \nsometimes what ends up happening is you \nforce your model to get really good at \nthese really rare examples \nand at the expense it forgets all the \nsimple examples so like you may have \nsolved that one percent really hard \nproblem but the 99 simple ones you know \nyou just degraded that performance by 50 \nbecause your model was all this energy \nso it's like it's not as easy as you \nknow as i think we we we think when we \nfirst you know start this problem and um \nuh \nso um some of our internal research in \nthis area is um probably less oriented \ntowards the vectors although we have \nideas on on that as well um but a little \nmore kind of going back towards the gan \nidea the generative adversarial network \nis to say you know can i train um \ncan i can i \nagain typically is thought of as \ngenerating synthetic images and the \ntraining is that there's a generator \nthat generates the image and the \ndiscriminator that tries to decide if \nthat's a real image or a fake image and \nthey fight each other in a so-called \nmini max competition so you train one \nand you train the other sort of um the \nanalogy people give is a \ncounterfeiter and a policeman so you \ntrain the counterfeiter by having the \npoliceman tell you you know is this a \ncounterfeit or not and then you freeze \nthe counterfeiter and you have the \npoliceman now try to train itself to get \nbetter by telling it the reality of \nwhether this is a counterfeit or not so \nthese two kind of compete with each \nother to get better and so \nwithout giving too much away we have a \nsimilar idea that the generator is uh \nyou know not really generating synthetic \nimages but just in this case has full \nknowledge of whether it is um \na label data labeled image or an \nunlabeled image and the discriminator \ntries to figure that out and if we can \nget to the point where um \nwe can trick the discriminator into \nthinking that uh an unlabeled data image \nis labeled then maybe it's gonna think \nmaybe that gives us an algorithm to pick \nuh the most useful unlabeled images the \nones that don't look like labeled images \nin other words the ones that are not \ngoing to \nthe ones that are actually gonna uh \nsorry let me start over uh if we can \ntrain a discriminator using this gan \nthinking but not a true can again in the \nclassic formulation then we may be able \nto use that discriminator to pick out \nthe most valuable unlabeled images that \ncan teach the model something without \nbeing so hard that it's going to destroy \nuh \nwhat the models learn but not being so \neasy that you're just wasting your time \nyou know back propping on really simple \nimages so that's sort of some of some of \nthe heart of how we've been kind of \nthinking about it um so apologies it \ndidn't go into the vector space but you \nknow our thinking there is a little more \ninspired by you know sort of the \ndiscriminator of again \nyeah i think um \ni had something i was going to ask you \nand then i and then i think i gained a \nbetter understanding of of this idea and \num \nso so purely from an unlabeled image the \ndiscriminator would be able to tell if \nit's been labeled because you also have \na classifier that's been trained on a \nlabeled set \nlike how does it \nconnect the information \nyeah um the uh \nthe discriminator could have information \nabout uh \nwould have information about the vectors \nthat come out of a \ntrained model um either the final \nprediction or the intermittent feature \nmap so those would be the vectors or the \nembeddings and based on that its job is \nto predict you know is this data point \nlabeled or not \nand uh you kind of you kind of use that \nto figure out these are the ones that \nare too easy so don't send it to them \nthese are the ones that are too hard and \nhere's ones that are right on the bubble \nwhere there's still some learning value \nthat's not going to trigger you know \nforgetting of some kind \nso \nyeah again a little more inspired by the \nkind of gan discriminator concept um uh \nthan necessarily um sort of vector \ndistances although we have other ideas \non you know using vector distances in \nother um you know active learning type \nideas where uh similar problem you know \njust can i label can i pick can i be \nmore intelligently \npick the data to spend my money to label \nas opposed to just randomly sampling you \nknow data points i'm seeing from \ninference or or using human judgment to \nyou know find you know visually go \nthrough the data and look for clusters \nis there some way to try to automate \nthat \nyeah the way that i originally described \nactive learning is i remember a paper \ncalled mind your outliers that is a \nsetting visual question answering data \nsets and that exact idea of which one \nwas the biggest loss and they find that \nlike you know you cannot it's impossible \nto answer and that's why it is so \nso yeah being a little more clever about \nthat uh so so semi-supervised learning \nand as i went through the masterful \ndocumentation that you know jumped out \nto me is \nlooking like one of the big focuses of \nmasterful is on the summers obviously we \ntalked about uh noisy student where in \naddition to having the image that you \nit's not just like you have the label \ndata set and you take the image apply \nnoise to it teacher labels that student \nlearns it it's also like you have \nunlabeled data as a part of this kind of \nthing and and that's the idea of \nsemi-supervised learning you have label \ndata big unlabeled data set \nso i and i'm sorry if these names have \nyou heard of the ada match the kind of \nuh that kind of approach where \ni think the key thing is they also they \nhave a loss function at the label layer \nand then also in an intermediate \nrepresentation of the \nteacher got it got it kind of \nso i guess kind of the question is uh \nlike what what are the uh what's the \nlandscape of semi-supervised learning \nlook like what are kind of some of the \ncutting edge ideas yeah yeah um \nso you're describing you know some of \nthem uh which is um \nkind of stepping back um when you take \nthe pair of models and you ask them to \nkind of match up \nyou get to pick \nwhatever kind of layer to try to match \nup and i'm not as i'm not obviously on a \nto match but sounds like you're trying \nto get intermediate layers to match up \nas well as the final layer you can argue \nthat you know in noisy student you're \ngetting the final final layer to match \nup which is a post postsoftmax um so it \nlooks like labels but the fact that this \nlabel is almost not as important as the \nfact that they just had to pick some \nfeature map um some output \nof of of a convolution and \nand relu \nand in a lot of other models like \nbarlows then they stack on a whole bunch \nof other layers which they end up \nthrowing away and then you just use an \nintermediate uh layer so \nalmost think of like you know you got \nresin at 50 and then you force it to do \nand just throw away the final layer so \nyou have just resonant 45 and you just \nfind that the intermediate layer is more \ngeneralizable in some way whereas the \nfinal layers get too task specific um \ntowards the \npretextual task that you're using \npretextual means you've created a task \nfor these models \nthat is \non the surface not actually solving your \nproblem but through solving that \npretextual problem you end up solving \nthe problem you actually care about \nwhich is to learn better representations \nwhich will get you a more kind of \naccurate model \num \nuh so i think um one of the most \ninteresting things is i think when you \nlook at \nsemi-supervised learning um \nuh \nalthough as i mentioned noisy student \nand then the unsupervised pre-training \ntechniques like barlows and simclr look \nvery different they actually have a lot \nof similarities ultimately \nbut you know sending that similarity \naside and looking just at the idea of \npre-training \nthis isn't the first paragraph of this \nmclr paper they talked about um \ncontrastive as one basic idea but the \nother one being generative \nand so generative you know they actually \ncite you know good fellows gand paper um \nso could you train again \nuh and then use the representation in a \ngan \nto act as a technique for building an \nunsupervised feature extractor \nand the conclusion broadly was no those \nrepresentations waste too much energy \ntrying to get pixel perfect \nimages and so they aren't generally very \ngood but you know kind of the latest \nlatest right now is uh you know \ntransformers and uh feature \nreconstruction kind of taking over where \nyou just uh you know take an image and \nthen you \nliterally add white noise to the pixels \nof an image and you ask again to kind of \nreconstruct that and you know that \napparently has turned out to be a very \ninteresting and powerful technique for \nthe model to learn representations uh \ninside and become a very good feature \nextractor and you know i think it goes \nback to um you know some older research \nthat did not beat state of the art but \nit is i think very well known at this \npoint \none was \nto colorize images so if you have a \nblack if you have a color image turn it \nto black and white and then train your \nmodel it's not exactly an auto encoder \nit's kind of an auto encoder at that \npoint to colorize the image and then um \ngodars i think his first name is spiros \ndon't want to butcher it i think around \n2017 or 2018 he did a classic paper it \nwas just sort of a proof of concept just \nrotating the image in 90 degrees 180 \ndegrees and 270 degrees and then your \npretextual task in that case was to \npredict the amount of rotation of the \nimage and you know they just found that \noh you these these these models \num did learn an interesting \nrepresentation inside it may not have \nbeen better than supervised training on \nimagenet but it did learn something and \nthat was just really cool at the time so \nthen the next question was when does it \nget better than supervised and that's \nwhere you know some clr kind of uh was \nsuch a breakthrough in that you know for \nfor one percent of labels it actually \ndoes train better \nthan than a supervised technique um \nso sorry you asked a more direct \nquestion and i wondered a little bit but \nit's such an exciting area and yeah \nit just always frustrated me that you \nneed labels because images have \ninformation so it's not a feature that \nyou need a label that's a bug i mean you \nknow there's there's nothing that holds \nthere should be nothing that holds a \nmodel back from learning from images \nyou know without labels uh so this this \nwhole field is just you know super \nexciting \nyeah and \nyou're so knowledgeable about it that it \ninspires so many different like ideas \nthat listen to you and there's so many \nlike questions i there's so many \ndirections like we could go in but \nso the question i'd want to follow on \nwith is \nso this idea where um it can uh \nas i kind of want to pivot into say \ncycle gans and the image to image \ntranslation thing yeah \nto kind of build up this idea the idea \nthat you classify the rotation \nangle so you're rotating say that's a 45 \ndegree rotated airplane yeah the \ncyclogan image to image translation idea \nwould be like you rotate the airplane \nand then it's like unrotated rotate yeah \nyeah \nso so i've been thinking about this idea \nabout like could this help with \ndistribution shift where uh \nthe distribution shift happens kind of \nand it can sort of map it back to the \noriginal thing yeah absolutely \ndoes that idea make sense yeah i mean \ncycle gans were um i mean the cycle part \nwas just a consistency to try to prove \nthat you know if you can go from horse \nto zebra back to horse very effectively \nthen the cycle was kind of completed and \nso it was a way to kind of enforce the \ngoal but the real task was not the cycle \npart but um you know a technique called \nyou know image to image uh translation \nwhich says like you know if i have a \num \nyou know a horse and a pose can i then \ngenerate a zebra in that pose and can i \nthen generate a dog in that pose \nand um so i i'd suggest people look at \nyou know the series of papers that \nxunhuang i believe study the cornell \nunder belongi um generated and his first \nidea was neural style transfer which we \nall know just just by looking at the \nlayers but then adding adding the same \nideas but with adversarial losses so the \nconcept from gans then allowed these \nmore like really even more powerful \ntechniques um \nwe've researched that area quite a bit \nparticularly for domain adaptation as \nyou described \nwe looked at one scenario where um you \nknow there are two major satellite \nproviders and although visually you look \nat the images they look the same um if \nyou train a classifier just on one it \nwon't do very well on the other it'll be \nlike two-thirds of the performance so \nyou know could you use some of these \ntechniques to to do an unsupervised \nimage to image translation um \nand um what we found was \nand it may go back to that first \nparagraph of the sim clr paper which is \nwhen you \nwell maybe it doesn't i'm not sure about \nthat but um \nit seems like a lot of energy is put \ninto \nvisually appealing translations but it \nkind of doesn't really fool the model \nthat you're trying to train so we were \nnot able to successfully perform domain \nadaptation uh using these techniques and \ni think \nif i had to hypothesize i think at least \nin part again \nimage that images are often very large \nobjects very well framed and in the \ngeospatial applications that we were \napplying you know you've got much \nsmaller objects and so it was much a \nmuch more difficult challenge if you \nhave a picture of a horse that's taking \nup 75 of the pixels and you translate \nthat into a dog i'm suspecting that'll \nprobably be useful um and more \nbelievable um but uh this is probably i \nthink the more um \ni'll go out on a limb i don't think this \nis backed up by research but i think my \nobservation of just a generative \nadversarial id of adversarially trained \nmodels in general is that they seem to \nwork better for these very large well \ncropped images as opposed to lots of \nfine grained images so in the \napplications we've tried it you know we \nwere not able to um \nto to to get success i do think there \nare some startups in the space of you \nknow combining um \n3d generated graphics but then using \ngans for more textures which presumably \nmaybe that's where a little bit stronger \nso you can imagine having a 3d game \nengine \ngenerate some \nstreet level imagery and then use again \nto kind of texturize it into rainy or \nnight time scenes maybe that adds more \ndiversity to the data \ni can imagine something like that \nworking um haven't done the research \nmyself \nyeah i've always been excited about this \nidea that we can just use kind of data \naugmentation and maybe even like the way \nthat cyclogan enables a more flexible \ninterface to cover a bigger distribution \nour data and \nit seems to me like deep learning can \nalways fit to the training set almost so \nit's like if you just blow up the \ntraining set with these priors about \nsemantic \npreservation sort of that you can just \ndo anything sort of with it it's always \nbeen the guy and think about it i wanted \nto kind of dive uh reference let me just \npause you right there and just mention \nthat you know what it seems like these \nuh adversarially trained \napproaches um \nthe distribution actually gets narrower \nnot more diverse so i mean if you just \nif you just fire up style again and you \nlook at the faces that come out of it \nyou're like oh my god these images look \nfantastic they look so realistic you \nknow \nbut then like um if you just you know \neven the paper they admit themselves you \nknow \npart of the reason they look so good is \nthey're sampling kind of the very narrow \nparts of the distribution when you push \nthat latent \nthe the \nthe embedding push it to really wide it \njust gets really kind of like broken so \nthere's actually a shortage of diversity \nnot too much diversity but not enough \nwithin and that's why it looks so good \nit's maybe maybe and again i'm going to \ngo out on limb i don't know if this is \ntrue but maybe that's why \nthey look so good as they get really \ngood at you know delivering 100 000 \nfaces you know really effectively but \nthey can't really represent the full you \nknow diversity of you know six billion \nyou know different faces um \ni think um \nthe the the github for uh that paper \nthat she wants a co-author on \nfoon it few shot unsupervised image \nimage translations it's called it has an \nimage of a dog rotating and all these \nother breeds of dogs rotating the same \nway you're like wow they've really \ntransferred that over but look closely \nall the noses are the same size \nthat's just a little trick you just \nstare at it along enough you start \nnoticing these little tricks like oh did \nit really do a full translation all \nspecies breeds of dogs or is it just \nbelievable to me and you that these 10 \ndogs look similar but it actually \ndoesn't really represent anything close \nto the full diversity of dog breeds much \nless dog poses much less dog poses in \ndifferent environments so maybe that's \none thing i'll just go on a limb and say \nhow about i call that future work \nhypothesis rather than conclusion or \ntrend \nyeah well that inspires me thinking \nabout like um i recently dove into a \npaper called augmax where they flip it \nto its friendly adversarial training and \nthey also do this uh like tsne space \nclustering where they show you that uh \ncertain generative techniques they \nexactly as you describe they just make \nit super dense on the yeah \nyeah \nyeah nice i hadn't read about that but \nobviously you know i'm familiar with t \nsneeze and i love actually you know our \nlogo is actually inspired by a t-sne \nlike when we were designing the logo it \nshould be blobby like a t-sne so that's \nexactly why our logo is what it is \noh yeah i see some cool art art where \nit's like um \nsorry i'm gesturing like a t-shirt i \nhaven't seen this on a t-shirt yet but \ni've seen like uh the the data set used \nto train hugging faces bloom model i've \nseen that put into an embedding space \nand it's like colored by languages these \nkind of ts yeah yeah yeah yeah a the \ntensorflow embedding has an open source \ntool you can you know just just cluster \nmnist and all the dots will fly around \nyou can use other clustering techniques \ni think umap and uh but yeah the idea \nthat you know these these things are \nmeant to be blobby this is the real \nworld this is not a tabular world like \nif we're a tabular company we'd have a \ngrid right like a good tabular world \nwhere everything's neat and organized \nbut no this is messy this is deep \nlearning this is this is the real world \nyeah and um \nwe had so i guess uh it's like um \nso we certainly could continue this \nconversation for a while i think there's \nquite a few ideas in this whole thing \nbut i i do want to kind of step out a \nlittle bit for the sake of keeping our \npodcast a little dense and and maybe \nkind of asking about like how you see \nthe we vva vector search technology \nplaying with masterful and it kind of \ncoming back into like the tools and the \nsoftware yeah absolutely absolutely so i \nmean just stepping back to you know our \ngoal is to provide more high level tools \nfor developers so they can access all \nthe power of deep learning without you \nknow spending two years becoming you \nknow deep learning experts and reading \nall the papers you've read right like \nlike \nwhat what person building a back-end app \nwas gonna read all the papers on \nrelational theory and relational algebra \nand relational calculus like you don't \nhave to do that anymore right you just \nyou learn enough sql to do what you need \nto do and you got all this power that's \nsitting behind the surface that you \ndon't need to know about anymore i mean \nthat is the vision we're trying to get \nto here um so we currently support \nclassification object detection and \nsemantic segmentation and obviously \nthere's a whole bunch more computer \nvision tasks that we want to support um \nand there's something unique about uh \nsimilarity search you know whether \nyou're applying it for computer vision \nor for uh text which is um \nin classification and and the other \ntasks i mentioned once you have a \ntrained model \nyou're ready to go to inference \nput it up in you know tensorflow serving \nor you know onyx runtime put it on a \nkubernetes cluster or you can use you \nknow easier packages like you know \ngoogle vertex uh endpoints you're ready \nto inferent you're ready to run \ninference you know \nintegrate with your app \nin similarity search you are not done \nonce the model is trained because now \nyou've generated all these embeddings \nand you've got you know a million of \nthem \nwell now we've got to search over all of \nthem so to deliver a complete product to \nour users obviously we need to partner \num with a company like like we v8 \nbecause you've got to put those \nembeddings into the database to then \nallow you know users to do that reverse \nlookup you know indexing down through \nthose embeddings and then rediscover \nlike which faces is is this or what \nbuilding or what room is this \nembedding represent um so um \nour our initial i think uh \nthought on working together just as a \nproof of concept would just be to use a \nclassifier that's that's trained using \nyou know our techniques of supervised \nand \nsemi-supervised techniques taking an \nintermediate and betting and just seeing \nis that sort of a good enough mvp uh \nembedding just uh just to kind of prove \nthe point that you know we can build an \nend-to-end product that involves \ntraining and \nthe vector search database um \nand so once we can prove that then um uh \nyou know it gives us you know uh uh more \nconfidence that when we do kind of uh do \na full on hardcore similarity search uh \nsupport that we'll already have all the \nintegration set up so we can deliver a \ncomplete solution for our customers so \nagain they don't have to understand \nhierarchical small navigable worlds they \ndon't have to you know understand uh \nrandog they don't have to understand uh \nsim clr they can just say hey i got \nthese two tools that'll solve that for \nme put in the training data \nout comes the train model run the \nembedding put the embeddings in your \ndatabase and now i've got a way to look \nup any image by running inference get \nthe embedding look it up in the database \nand i can figure out what is what's the \nnearest you know image or person or \nthing that this image represents so uh \nso i'm excited to uh to pursue that and \nyou know we've already started some of \nour uh \nsome of our uh \nproof of concept work on this \nyeah that's super interesting i i love i \nmean it perfectly said that the \ncombination between the model training \nthe end-to-end and then having the \ndatabase where you stored the \nrepresentations that have been learned \nand then the way that the these hmsw \nstructures you don't want to do a dot \nproduct with a million images \nso the way they play together is so \ninteresting and i think that's also like \nkind of the interpretability of it like \nwhen you have a object detection \ninference you can be like it looks like \nthis i've seen this kind of thing before \nsort of do you like that kind of \ninterpretability play of it and sorry \nactually let me \ni think this is a good chance to kind of \nwe talk about retrieve then read \npipelines all the time in natural \nlanguage processing because in natural \nlanguage processing it's so intuitive \nyou have data sets like squad where you \nsay what is the atomic number of oxygen \nso naturally if you retrieve the context \nof wikipedia going oxygen you know the \natomic number eight and then you just \ncan classify it there so with nlp it \nmakes so much sense but can i ask you \nabout this retrieve then read uh for \ncomputer vision tasks like \nclassification detection and \nsegmentation to just start there \nyeah well i would i would i would uh \nframe that as i you know \ncurrently would think of similarity \nsearch as a separate computer vision \ntask to support um uh \nin addition to our you know binary \nclassification multi-label \nclassification single label captioning \nobject detection semantic segmentation \num other computer vision tasks we want \nto support over time would be you know \nkey point detection instance \nsegmentation uh pose estimation uh \nobject tracking um but what's a little \nbit unique about uh this is uh you know \nwe've built in um some unsupervised \npre-training techniques which um you \nknow i think as you know are even \nsuperior methods to generate embeddings \num but it's also superior to a user \nbecause they don't have to label their \ndata to get the similarity search \nnecessarily um the labels will help it's \nyet another data point \nso um i'm not sure if i've answered your \nquestion but \ni would just frame it as another \ncomputer vision task for us to support \nand then like i said as a proof of \nconcept we thought could we just take a \nclassifier train using traditional \ntechniques and use that embedding uh as \na similarity just as a proof of concept \nto to get our products to work together \nwith with the support of tasks that we \nhave today and like i said that already \nuh seems to be a positive \nyeah super cool and yeah i think with um \nlike self-supervised similarity learning \nis so sophisticated in computer vision \nwith again simclear and barlow twins the \ndata augmentation interface is so strong \nthat you get this search thing works \nextremely well without labels and i \nthink that's just incredibly interesting \ni can ask like broadly um what drew your \ninterest to computer vision if you kind \nof tell the story of \nyeah yeah um \nit goes back a long way uh \nso it goes back to just being a gamer in \nhigh school and uh you know you some \npeople like me get excited about you \nknow can i render my own computer \ngraphics at some point \num and so there's that you know \ni went and started my computer science \nprogram in an undergrad at berkeley you \nknow i i put down computer graphics \nthat's a specialty for it and you know \nonce you render something then you want \nto like know what you rendered and i \nremember like hacking z buffers just to \ntry to figure out you know basically you \nwould call it segmentation today if you \ncould access the you know the z buffer \nthat you know \nfrustums and all that stuff and um \ni had a professor john forsythe who \nwrote \nan image classifier for horses \nand that basically ended my interest in \ncomputer graphics and computer vision in \nthe 90s because it was just so \nheuristics based it was just all these \nlike hand crafted ideas if we just throw \nthis and this and this and wait all \nthese little like hand-crafted rules \nthen maybe we can figure out what a \nhorse is and i said that is just so not \nelegant um and i ended up going to \ndatabases ironically enough having a \nchat with it with a guy from a database \ncompany because databases are applied \nalgorithms you know b-plus trees are \njust you know wide red black trees \nit was just such an elegant space and \nyou know indexes \nno no question my favorite part and so \nit was a really real really enjoyable \nfor me to to learn about uh \nhnsws and just seeing you know an index \napplied to a graph instead of you know a \nvector or a heap it's uh it's been it's \nbeen nice anyways um \nso i was out of computer vision you know \nfrom the 90s until about five years ago \nuh so my co-founder sam wookie our cto \nhe stayed in computer vision he's \nfounded a startup he ended up selling to \nthe nfl to track you know player \nmovements on the field pre-deep learning \nand when deep learning came out i didn't \nknow anything about it uh but he was \nfollowing all this stuff he's like oh my \ngod \ndeep learning can correct all the \ncomputer vision problems that like i \nthought were uncrackable at the time so \nhe left microsoft and joined google just \nso he could kind of join the mecca of \ndeep learning and and kind of you know \nlearn learn the learn the secrets uh you \nknow \nso um \nuh you know sam sam um \nuh \nsam \nsaid to me \nall the stuff is working \ntake the andrewing coursera course on ml \nto get up to speed \ntake the enduring deep learning \nspecialization and i hadn't programmed \nin 15 years and i did and first of all i \nrealized i enjoyed programming but \nsecond again \nor still and then secondly i was just \namazed by the power of deep learning \nlike holy cow from all those heuristics \nfrom that john forsythe and i'm i'm not \ndenigrating his papers just that was a \nstate of the art at the time but it just \nwasn't for me but there's just an \nelegance to \nto just having machines train themselves \nuh and so so i was hooked so that's sort \nof my return my first and second uh love \naffair with uh with with deep learning \nand computer vision \nuh that's the magic of deep learning \nthe whole input output \nit's amazing it's absolutely amazing \nit's amazing \nyeah i had a sim the uh story of uh sam \nin the nfl thing i i the first computer \nvision project i dove into is \ni was i had full basketball games and i \nwas trying to extract like made baskets \nand i think once like kind of coming \nback to your point about imagenet and \nbeing object centric and you know i i \ngot started studying like c far 10 i \nthink \nand yeah once you get into like a real \nproblem you really appreciate these \nthings like uh class imbalance or uh \njust the challenge of labeling data and \nwhy these semi supervised like once you \nget a real project you'll really \nappreciate the semi-supervised learning \nthing just because of the cost of \nlabeling the data and \nall that cool stuff uh so one other \nquestion i really want to ask you about \nis is your experience at masterful ai \ncan you tell me about the inception of \nmasterful and all that kind of stuff \nabsolutely well i mean the beginning of \nthis story is just exactly where my last \nstory you know trailed off which is you \nknow sam got me super excited about deep \nlearning um he was at the mecca you know \nat google but you know he started \ntelling me some of the um the ugly truth \nabout deep learning um which is huge \nmodels huge compute budgets you know uh \nhuge labeling budgets \nand you know sam instinctively was just \nlike this is cool but like how do we \nmake this work for \nyou know just just you know maybe people \ncompanies with two deep learning \nengineers or maybe just a general you \nknow software engineer like a lot of our \nfriends who you know don't want to spend \ntwo years learning all this stuff and \nthat was the basic instinct that he had \nand um \nand he thought the technology was there \nuh to achieve that um which is you know \nall the stuff in our platform and then \non the flip side um \nthe technology may have been there and \nit may have been his instinct but i \nwanted to see if there was really a \nmarket demand for it so um \ni linked up with another friend of mine \nuh who i respect a lot tom reichard \nwho's now my third co-founder um \nhe uh had been a venture capitalist uh \nor was then still a venture capitalist \nhad been one for about 10 years so i \nreally trusted his insight in kind of \nwhat the market was \nand um in particular he like he wasn't \none of those guys investing in social \nyou know media networks he was he was \nyou know investing in deep tech so he \ninvested in a lot of ai companies and he \nsaid yeah i've seen lots of startups \ntrying to commercialize deep learning \nand it's incredibly hard to get the \nmodels going so kind of between my you \nknow inspiration and the space from sam \nand his kind of idea that the technology \nwas ready to go and then tom saying yeah \nthe demand is there we said well if both \nof those things are there then you know \nit's the right time for us to kind of \nbuild a startup to to kind of bridge \nthat gap and so that's the birth of mass \ntools so i've got two just you know \nabsolutely amazing co-founders and tom \nand sam and uh and we barked on this uh \nthis journey \ncan i ask about without sort of saying \nlike could you describe the competition \nin the space could i ask about sort of \nthe the category that you think that \nmasterful falls into in some adjacent \ncategories yeah absolutely um \nthe most narrow and closest adjacent to \nus would be um \nthe automl providers and um \nyou know we live up to the same promise \nas automl feed and data and get back a \ntrain model where we've been a little \nreluctant to brand ourselves there is um \nwe philosophically are are \nare not in the same place as as most of \nthe existing auto mal providers um \nthey are very neural architecture \noriented whereas our hypothesis \nfundamentally is more data centric \nwe think it's a lot less interesting to \ntry to fine-tune the perfect model size \nand it's a lot more interesting to \nunderstand you know how to get the most \nout of those architectures so in our in \nour command line interface for example \nyou can you can select the right \narchitecture we think you should pick \nthe architecture based on your inference \nlatency you know throughput you know \ncost requirements which you can predict \njust from you know the architecture so \nif you're on an edgy device you may need \na certain device if you if you have \nmaximum accuracy then pick efficient at \nb7 you're going to get like 99.9 of all \nthe improvements that you can from \narchitecture just by doing that \nthe interesting thing is how do you \nmanipulate the data through \nregularization how do you add unlabeled \ndata \nso so i would say that they are broadly \nour competition we have a very different \nphilosophy um and not to plug my product \nbut you know we put out the blog reports \nshowing how we beat like like google \nvertex automl on a whole series of data \nsets um because i think we take a more \nholistic approach \nand a more data centric approach um to \nthe problem um kind of expanding the \nring a little bit \num thinking about less as just sort of \ndata in and model out think of this as \ndollars in and more accuracy out you \nmight say that we also kind of kind of \nmaybe you might imagine we kind of bump \nup up against like active learning a \nlittle bit you know again this idea of \nyou know can i be more efficient with my \nlabeling spend but the good news is we \ndon't really compete in that space as \nmuch as these are complementary \ntechniques um people can easily have \nboth um \nso um that kind of contextualizes kind \nof where we fit um in the space and kind \nof what what other platforms somebody \nmight be you know \ncomparing us to depending on you know \nwhat profile they're in \nawesome well yeah shane thank you so \nmuch for this i'm so grateful for you \ntaking your time to do this and i'm so \nlucky to have like such a information \nheavy podcast in our web podcast \ncollections is really amazing so thank \nyou so much \ni've super enjoyed it i didn't realize \nwe're gonna go like this technical but \nuh but i'm glad we did because it's um \nit's just so inspirational you know and \nsometimes it's hard to \nit's hard to describe to you know my \nparents like why this stuff is just so \nexciting but um i mean the breakthroughs \nare just \nit's um
