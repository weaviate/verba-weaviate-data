{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the 60th Weaviate podcast with Patrice Bourgougnon! Patrice is the creator of ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for watching another episode of the wevia podcast I'm super excited to welcome Patrice burgundy on to the podcast Patrice is one of the most active open source contributors to weviate filing issues you know poking it apart seeing the new updates and so I'm so excited to chat with Patrice quickly um Patrice I remember you gave this feedback when ref to VEC first came out and that really meant a lot to me and so just all these contributions like really it's just so awesome to see I expect this to be such a deep conversation into you know what you're building and the miscellaneous features of webiate and your perspective on it so firstly thank you so much for joining the podcast I'm very happy to be in your podcast I'm following you for quite a long time now we can start the podcast with um like you know like to set the stage for our listeners like what are you building so I'm a developer for a long time now and I'm building a plugin on extension for WordPress and more specifically woocommerce but it works for naked workplace too and the idea is to have a better search in in WordPress than the standard MySQL uh search which is I think it's not even full text search so there are plenty of plugins and the specificity of a WP solar which is the the plugin is to use external search engines uh to to power the search for many reason performance uh capabilities features attunability and so on and so on yeah super quiet I think like um yeah like WordPress I I remember like you know back early like early days when I was learning about almost like the internet to say with WordPress like how WordPress helps you set up this website and that kind of integration of like semantic search and advanced AI uh tools into WordPress it all sounds so interesting can you maybe tell me about like yeah like how's like how's like the business of running that kind of thing like what are sort of the nuances of that market you mean for ai ai search yeah I guess just the like it must be an interesting it's kind of like no code like can you tell me a little more about like how you kind of would the the experience of this kind of like building AI into something like WordPress yes so uh WordPress it's it's something a little bit uh specific compared to headless Solutions now no code solution and so on because you you can have both of words you can be fully knockout but you have access to its open source and you install it in your on your server or on a hospital hosted service and you can access the full full code and you can modify the not the core of Wordpress obviously because each if you update the core and next word is you lose your your card but you can create what is what is name the plugin an extension that you push you upload on your server and it does really whatever you want that's that very that's why I'm I love WordPress as a developer because you can go for no code or for full code completely something completely custom so in in terms of a market for small businesses that they they tend to to use on the Shelf plugins with minimal configurations and and but you know it's it's a it's an addiction so many many word personas uh and with a hundred plugin in their uh in their website and it's it can be a problem for inter uh entire operability between the plugins so you install one it breaks another one and so on compatibility with WordPress versions uh so there's a trade-off installing only the ones that you need but it's difficult because you have thousands of plugins available and for more specifically for search plugins you have plugins which are working with WordPress inside WordPress only um so extending extending WordPress but but stay inside WordPress and selling nothing specific so continuing to to work with my SQL as a search engine and other plugins which are using like like minor which are using external solutions that can be itself hosted or hosted on a SAS Service as well so are these um like I remember when I first saw like WordPress plugins you have like PHP what kind of like uh languages are using to connect weviate and um WordPress that's uh that's something which is kind of uh of a limitation uh today uh the market uh is a pizza Nick for for AI and so everything is python so that's that's probably a good reason why I chose uh we had two years ago when I started evaluating the market and the features performance and so on because if uh if you don't have the embeddles the vectorizers inside the your vector database you'll have to produce somehow the vectors from the data you have in WordPress woocommerce so you you will have to send the title description attributes like price color sizes for for woocommerce and create a vector gets back the vector and send it to to the vector database like we've yet or another one and vectorization is almost 100 percent made from python clients using python in WordPress I don't take it I don't think it's really possible in fact so there are two solutions either with the PHP client which doesn't exist for widget or if you have the chance or Merchants to be a developer you can do it because we yet provide the two apis which is very specific one is a rest API to do everything from managing a widget and for instance uploading your data to vectorize um but you have also graphql API to to do the search thing so searching with vectors filtering aggregating uh and so on but it's also a kind of rest API in fact so in a way I had to create my own PHP client inside WordPress calling the rest apis of Viet it's not a clean PHP client so it can be uh open source and so on because it's it's really difficult to build the real one with and take the responsibility to maintain it and let's say it's a it's a kind of mini version of a PHP client hmm yeah that that topic and we made always fascinates me like the all the different clients like a recent podcast we had Andre who's building uh Lang chain Ruby you know like kind of like building all these tools native to Ruby you know like uh we have a when we were doing the integration with Microsoft symante kernel we were then building like for C sharp like typescript yeah [Laughter] no it is a big subject for is repressing keeping the pythonic API interfaces but to replacing with something behind the scene with something faster like uh like rust for instance so I think upon that tool is rest or something like that and the the thing uh yes multi-language multi yes multi languages is a big topic uh usually it's done with the with client builders like open API and yaml file and so on but uh uh currently as far as I know yes for viviet it's a python under the and that's it so it's not a big deal in fact if you don't have to implement the or rest API if we yet you just have to concentrate on a few features and that's uh that's enough in fact um PHP is mostly nowadays [Music] I could make enemies here but it's mostly about WordPress Drupal CMS apart from projects for big companies which are producing the full stack in the PHP like say Symphony for instance or laravel uh so probably in the future there will be less less PHP uh clients I don't think there will be much more than than today yeah but I I uh one more kind of technical question on how you're building with we V8 before we get into higher level topics about you know just the broad space but like I'm curious about how you're using these like inference containers like you have weavier and then you also have like the text of that clip and so on like how are you thinking about managing those two uh like uh services like you know the database and then the inference containers uh it's important I don't I I didn't get that to uh to will get so in widget you have indeed the the stateless and the stateful uh part and the stateful is uh it's a pure of a black black boat at my level so it's single and I don't even know how it works so story storing vectors algorithm and so on um but to uh let's say you're in uh in the Burpee solar now in the the WordPress Administration so you selected your search engine types or widget and then you have several choices so you have a choice a drop down list of vectorizers so use you can select all currently I think all the vectorizer is available not all for we can discuss about that for because I don't right now though I don't do um image similarity so I do text to image but not image to to text or image to image so you select let's say a text to text to back uh clip open AI uh Correa and now Google pen too and the only thing I do from the plugin from the PHP code in fact is calling the rest API of who yet and configure creating a a new class a class in widget being the equivalent of a table let's say in MySQL and the parameters that are sent with this class creation are some default field the field types and the vectorizer and then a few parameters depending on the vectorizer you have chosen for instance if you choose the clip vectorizer you have to choose a fit for instance the percentage of search in text or in in images if you choose the hybrid vectorizer I know hybrid it's in graphql that's another question but so parameters depends on the vectorizer you've chosen in in WP solar but that's that's a bit magic here the you you have to you have to think a little bit before because you need okay I need a clip for instance I want to use Docker I want to install Docker somewhere perhaps on the same server as WordPress so you have to produce your Docker widget file with the vector with the the clip model configured so you go to uh to we get to the widget site there's a nice wizard to produce folding configuration possible including the clip and then you you download the docker file and you modify it if necessary and you launch it so that the only thing which is a bit uh a bit not completely Integrity because that's but there's no way to to go further in fact uh so launching the right Docker with a right vectorizer and after that you choose the same vectors in WP Sera and everything is done automatically on the class definition that's it you you can rather than installing Docker you can install kubernetes and the the description and configuration made and we've yet with website is great so you just I'm not at all a specialist of kubernetes and I could manage to install it for my demos and for some customers also and it's pretty great and kubernetes is great yeah well at first said I just would like to say that I'm not much of a cloud expert myself you know I've been around we've had enough to know a bit of these things and so you know luckily I have Patrice here today like um you know I remember like when I was early I was like doing consulting and I had like a website that I hosted on GoDaddy and so I just had like connected like I had just um like put my stripe thing in JavaScript right on the website so is that kind of similar to how you can uh install Docker and run the wevia containers no because so when you forward press you have several options uh you have options where the server is is completely invisible to you so you go to a site like you said a good idea or similar hosting providers and you just click on the button that says create a new WordPress for me a little bit of parameters but that that's it and after that you you never have access to your WordPress server or perhaps you will have access to to the file system of your WordPress but only with FTP so no SSH access no remote access nothing so you you can't install anything at that 99.9 percent of uh WordPress owners today uh another possibility that in fact you are you are installing it on a dedicated virtual machine uh and then potentially you you could have some access to the machine and install your Docker for instance or even a small kubernetes a monoc cluster or two not clusters on it but in general you will have to to install your widget outside of your WordPress service or server uh it could be on the same hosting provider for instance so you've done that for WordPress and then you rent a host and you install your Docker or you create a on the same machine product or another one you create your Caster or cluster service like your Google cloud or Amazon or Microsoft or any other and so on and so on yeah I think I mean like one more like it's kind of hopefully not too broad and uh like rhetorical but like this kind of like you know deviates open sourcing of these Docker images as well as like the kubernetes helm charts how how has that kind of impacted your development experience with Wii uh it's pretty standard for it's pretty standard for for me in fact uh currently uh WP solar can connect to 506 search engines and most of them are open source elasticsearch Apache Apache solar open search now which is a fork of elasticsearch uh and after they are closed the search service which are such services and so that's pretty pretty similar we starting with yet is like installing a that there's a small difference indeed in fact it's exactly the same but it's different because the there are no currently as far as I know there are no uh hosting companies providing widget as a service except a widget himself with a is a with yet Crystal server service so in general what I'm used to is for let's say elastic search I I'm going to a hosting service uh likeelastic.co like Bonsai there's plenty of them and so and that's the same Principle as WordPress that means it's a you click you select okay I want this this member of ram I want the size of disk and so on and from there you have a dashboard and uh you have a you have a token and from this token you enter it in WP solar and it's connected so that would be exactly the same process apart from the fact that currently it can be done to my knowledge only on with just hosting services so for for some customers I I used to install a kubernetes kubernetes cluster for for we yet especially because for instance a customer needed the clip the clip model if I remember the clip model is is not part of the hosting package of of we if we get so anyway I would have had even if I was a student at 12 yet I would have had to install it but it's possible to do both you can start with vehicles or Services which is great because it's very easy to set up you don't have to set it up in fact same as for WordPress you you go to there to you register you click on a button it creates a crystal service you get your token and you put this token in WB solar with your user password I think before it was user password now it's a token if I remember it's two years ago so it looks like a dinosaur now um so yes widget has now plenty of authentication schemes so you huge choose the one you want and after that you say I want uh I I want uh Noob for instance uh an open Ai vectorizer and that's it you do it and then you send your data from the wp server and and so on but if you need something different for instance you you have Trends so that's another Market let's say you have trained the vectorizer model a sentence a Transformer model I don't know who would be able to do that but it's it's possible then you would need to uh to use this model and you would have to install your kubernetes cluster probably and uh upload your models and so on yeah let's so we're going to come back into this kind of like yeah your own model but yeah I think just the story that we're to ever read a transition topics now but like this I love this story this like um you know I again I don't claim to be an expert in this I'm just kind of following along with the Wii via story and learning from like an interest in Vector search and seeing how the Market's playing out but you have like this uh you know leviate and these big Vector database companies building out this like cloud service platform on like Google Amazon Microsoft like a big you know cloud services and you know there's engineering teams that build this but then you also have this open sourcing of like kubernetes Helm charts and Docker images and then you have this Market emerges that uh you know it's it's I see it as it's kind of like Consulting but then it's there's even so much opportunity in the cloud and finding niches of how people want to run it that it even becomes almost like SAS quickly here's this ass I see and so yeah I I again I don't know yeah it's a you you you that's that's a great thing or or not because it's opinionated people prefer to be needed people prefer not to be opinionated so it's easier when you have no choice you have no choice okay it will it will be fine because that's my only choice and that's typically the smaller the smaller business Market uh with the small business Market one typically one owner for woocommerce shop the idea of installing will get anywhere on the uh it doesn't have any idea what is with yet it doesn't have any idea what is Vector search what what is interest what is interesting in is AI search because AI search is a marketing and so AI is it's a synonym for magic in fact so all what you could couldn't do before you will be able to do it that's that's the magic it's kind of magic but it's not completely magic so it can be a little bit deceiving but that things which are pretty magic so for this kind of customers they must have something much easier and uh but but even if the the SE guys that have chosen to go to AIDS AI search and go to an external search engine and so on even them are a little bit different from the very average WordPress or woocommerce user I guess wouldn't dare to to to go the this very muddy roads and so that they would prefer the the search plugin I mentioned before which stay in WordPress outside nothing to configure and which is fine it's only when the the the reach the problems that they really need these kind of Solutions in general they they come to WP solar or similar solutions for two reasons one is performance so if you have 500 000 products in your uh woocommerce catalog your search will will die because full text search on the with filters with aggregation for faceting and so on pagination salting and so on it's a that's not possible with uh with the standard technology okay you can scale up your your machine and so on but if you have a little bit it will be fine with the two or three concrete on choosers but if at the same time you have plenty of visitors Black Friday things and so on your your absolutely that because this kind of things cannot really be cached people often think that they will scale because you are cashing but with search it's very difficult to catch because there are so many parameters it's not the same keywords it's not the same filters it's not the same aggregations it's not the same Pages or pagination it's not the same sort so every you you can't cache because uh you you would need the database or terabytes um so yes there are really several markets and so the small very small ones they stay inside WordPress for for their search some who have some issues and uh so I I mentioned the first issue performance but there are there's also the other one which is quality in fact and quality is very that that's a full topic because how do you know what is quality that's uh that especially with Vector search how you qualify what is good because everything can be everything can can be retrieved so that that's under the benchmarks we discussed about that earlier but the benchmarks are sometimes not more for the keyword search than for Vector search so how do you compare this kind of benchmarks and so on so but they know that it can be better because for instance they detected they had plenty of such results with no results on their site uh an example coming for my demos because as soon as I installed with it on my demos I wanted to test some some crazy ideas like so on the 2000 products woocommerce demo I try things like something to sleep on obviously if you try that with a keyword search you have no results uh if you try uh in Cross domain across languages also so you have you have a sharper in English if it's in English it's not too bad because people will will try to search in English let's say you have a woocommerce in France in France but you'd like to uh benefit from customers all over the world so you you can't ask your customers to and your site is in French in French you don't want to translate it you have to let's say you have 100 000 products you can't translate them so you you don't want to require your future clients to search in French so what you need is a cross-language search and that's that's a magic part of Victor search for instance the fact that the models have been trained like course models on the 100 plus languages that means instantly you open to the whole world without doing anything that's that's a bit crazy in fact when you say about it you don't you didn't you didn't translate your site uh you didn't do anything specific you didn't create several indexes with several tunings for the limerizers the stemmers or the synonyms and so on it's uh it's done for you so that's uh uh so the trade-off is that it's very difficult to measure in terms of quality um because uh models are very imaginative so so the examples I gave you uh I tested I was so happy of the results I've put them on my own page so some screen screenshots so something to sleep on and obviously except in one case it was first result was matrices and for the sentence Transformer from a game face quite basic it was a second results not so bad that was the first result no problem at all and for I tested to cross languages and that's a that's quite amazing in fact you you have your catalog in English and you I tested in Chinese I don't speak Chinese so I use the first translator which is an AI too uh to translate my query and use it after that Chinese I tested French obviously Spanish and it works so yeah I'm sorry it works it works it's so difficult to say yeah of course you just urge testing the tip of the iceberg so does it work so well for all your coppers and so on that's I I don't know if it's even possible but it it works that's quite impressive yeah I think I think a really great transition from like you know into this kind of search engine stuff and like all the models and this emergence of like zero shot models and how it's really crazy to me like kind of studying machine learning seeing how like machine learning models are now just being like plugged into applications I mean this trend we've been like covering it quite heavily I think we did but yes the the llms become a community that's uh notice that something which nobody could forecast two years ago even one year ago probably and it's it's uh speaking up you see all that companies who are now providing the Frameworks to build your own and train your big language models like Mosaic ml for instance and other all Frameworks like aware and distributed computing and so on so uh the issue is of course uh that remains Technical and that remains very costly but when you compare what we were reading especially I guess for you because that's yet your topic what is ml three years ago ml that was okay first linear regression then things very simple in fact and today we are talking about NLP about decision Transformers the click models and then uh this model which have become uh commodity and now are delivered uh to use for API the wall throw thanks to the game face and and other solo download and you can install them through token and an API in widget all through all the real mode the real the docker model let's say the docker model in widget in your kubernetes that no nobody could have imagined that even we get two years ago I guess I remember the first models that we get were that were just before the Transformers we get as at its own models I don't remember the names in four or five languages uh and that that was impressive because that means that they created them by themselves and and so on and just as after that yes the community arrived with Transformers thanks to a better computability parallelism and and the big big text who entered the dance and now yes you can consume them that uh I'm myself I'm surprised when uh I'm on my widget cluster on the at each new until now at each new version of who yet I just updated my my configuration of uh kubernetes to update to the latest version of widget and uh activate a new feature like for instance recently the pump 2 uh now uh reranka with square or rianca with a Transformer models and it seems that every week I can activate something new that's a that's almost so real a bit too uh too good to be true in fact there must be some Traders somewhere I guess yeah well I think I think like just like with the like the the quality of deep learning models is accelerating so fast it just like you said it's almost unbelievable like I think you know the time of recording this podcast we now have the Llama to open source language model they're claiming that's you know I personally haven't had the chance yet to see to query it a little bit but like you know just you know from MPT 30 billion like this now we've got Cloud 100K getting stronger yes and everybody and everything is it seems that but that's the that's history uh everything is is going to open source now so um we had models which were closed behind the Napier after that we had models which were uh uh available downloadable but with some compromise on on the on the open source version okay it's open source but not commercial and certainly it seems now that uh no perhaps not fully but uh at least partially and it seems that everything is going uh is going there yeah I think I I listened to so Bob recently uh was at Arthur um speaking with Harrison Chase from Lang chain and uh you know uh a couple other people and but like um Bob had this new thing where he's talking about how you need to make the models stateful and I think this is really interesting about like retrieval augment to generation and like Bob compared uh like model weights to like MP3 files and you know with music and saying that like if you just distribute it there's no like value capture compared to kind of this newer generation of like the value capture is in making it stateful and it looks like with retrieval augmented generation like I think that's a really strong argument for how you would do that yes that's uh that's something which is interesting because uh here we'll okay so we will talk about uh I think which is a I understood recently which is a which was a bit strange for me compared to my experience but it's a human experience so Humana uh I must be wrong in fact so you have a just a teeny raw vision and you don't see what is the full spectrum but most we discuss about that and the um most Benchmark showed and are still showing that bm-25 so keyword search is still in competition with a large language models or any module in fact on General copies of course uh and no no in fact it's even better on the specialized copies so for me that was difficult to understand I guess for all the small all the people who are either not interesting At All by what is behind the Vector search or not not really technical or are not reading papers and so on that because when when I first try my uh my demos with a thing like that uh something to to sleep on obviously that it tilted as a okay that's far greater than the bm25 which is a standard for all such uh search engines now uh but it's not if if you produce a real Benchmark with a lot of data and on different areas and so on Dem 25 is still is still very good so that comes to your question about the rag and and so on it's the fine tuning so the fact that you're able to adapt in fact your your model to something specific that could be at several at several levels it could be okay I will specialize it for medical for e-commerce for instance I will say or it could could be even more specific I will adapt it to my website in fact uh I don't know if in a website there's something so specific as a uh products which has never been seen anywhere else during training of any large language models but so fine-tuning was the first idea so fine tuning is of unfreezing or some few some some few levels of uh at the beginning where the ordn and retrain a little bit with a few shots and so on but with a rag in fact it's a prompting engineering but rather than injecting your your prawn from your human brain in fact you are injecting prompts from your database but what was missing until recently uh was a Vector Research because you have a question you want to retrieve the project some data for some products for instance let's say that you want to to use rag for producing recipes so you have a site with a plenty of woocommerce was plenty of food vegetables meet anything and some some money is looking for for some kind of pasta and you want to produce some recipes so you have to from the query you have to retrieve your products but if you and then you with your products you will send it to a Netherland to to build your recipes or anything else so generative AI the problem is if you don't have a vector search which is intelligent enough to retrieve the right products with what we said the efficient we can be named by many names so uh uh let's say you you name a specific feature you don't have it in the in your site with a traditional search unless you have a long list thousands or tens of thousands of synonyms for instance the names in Latin for instance of all the fish in the world let's say that those 10 000 Latin names are equal to fish okay that's only for official you have to do the same thing for the mushrooms there are probably thousands and so on and so on whereas you can expect from on the Shelf which is used by for instance by widget you will be able to retrieve with the name of a fish you will be able to retrieve another fish that you have in stock for instance currently and you can extract that and put it in your prompt for generating your recipe for instance and so both are required in fact but both are the same as the same the two faces of the same coin because behind the scenes we we have a model we have bird we have GPT we have these kinds of Transformers in fact and they are really converging no to be honest until now I didn't so will yet provide the three generative models three generative apis riddles I think in the name uh I didn't have a usage right now I had a customer interesting recipes and so on but uh it's it's not obvious to to go from the idea to to start in fact so the recipes could be a a good a good point but I'm sure users will have plenty of ideas and if we're talking about that but uh the next Trend or two and perhaps that's the future of search boxes are chatbots what the first search box on the website just written just returning a list of results an advanced search box is you have a list of suggestions that appears more or less more or less complicated intelligent for instance proposing a list of similar keywords or similar results and so on but you can imagine to replace that by your chatbot so instead of having a dummy search box with dummy suggestions you could have something not to check both something kind of represent a chat box is it's a rag with a workflow of course so you mentioned mentioned launcher it can be in the main index and so on uh but the idea is the same and that could be interesting yes what is interesting is that you you could have different search boxes on your pages and one for recipes for instance and the Ws WP server can do that very easily so you you can have several configuration available and you could put for instance create an index with a clip search and one with a an open AI search and one with a sentence Transformer from again phase and mix it with the different generative AI apis provided by or models provided by we get a mix and match for instance so acquire vectorizer with a palm 2 generative result for the recipe or the opposite or uh there are so many possibilities now on the list goes and so in what part of your site you will have this search works about recipes and another part will be another Third Watch about traveling for instance because the parameter chat box is it it has to be super intelligent you have only one interface for everything so usually what is done is that you create intense so you define intents in your chatbot one is for recipe so you define a list of sentences that makes the intent if he's talking about fish is prob it's probably hey everyone knows sorry about that we had a connection crash unfortunately um yeah so Patrice you just taught me a ton of things I have so many notes written down with sort of different topics that we're going through I mean I guess uh I don't want to like we're I think we're recently talking about like search boxes and kind of the user interfaces and how that's innovating you know things like type ahead search where you propose a query as you're searching and or or interfaces to propose multiple queries off all this is just really fascinating I think uh yeah I think there's a company called versel that's building like a lot of uis that people plug in with these kind of tools it's definitely an emerging space um there was one thing that I you know and then we talked about like retrieve augments generation tooling and fine tuning but there is one idea in there that I think is really fascinating very early is we were talking about like BM 25 being a strong Baseline compared to Vector search and I think there is a new argument around that that I think is really interesting is like right now when we think about retrieval augmented generation we're thinking about searching finding text putting that text in the input and then just that input goes to the Transformer but the the next generation of these Transformers I think you're going to take the the search results and you're going to put them in the middle of the Transformer so say layer 8 out of 12 is where you inject embeddings and so in this sense it's like embeddings are truly kind of I think that's just a huge argument for Vector embeddings particularly that's like the the encodile decoder scheme in fact the victors of the encoder that go in the middle of somewhere if I remember of the decoder GPT model oh yeah yeah I I'm sure people will not stay at uh at this level and I will try to to overcome this uh those limitations on the uh that it was it was more uh that uh when I when I read the the it was a video I think from meta rank uh they had but it was a great video with a presentation uh at darling Bells as if I remember and they had plenty of uh uh they had plenty of benchmarks they made with the with their tooling and they've tried everything if I BM 25 alone uh Beyond coder alone Bianco door plus cross encoder a different type of cross encoding hebrewed mode and so on and so on and with a the big test uh with hundreds of thousands of predefined uh tests it was better but not not so much in fact so when you looked at the slides you cannot believe that how much I fought you you had to put on on your vector search compared to the few percentage you could you could gain and uh that was a bit surprising but after all uh BMW 35 has been made for that they've been chewed for for 20 years so we just at the beginning for for Vector search and and the Next Generation and hybrid mode as you said there will be other hybrid mode we can't even imagine now uh that that another part interesting which is a re-ranking for instance that's that's a big Trend I guess now uh so we just enter residents uh with two or two ways of re-ranking which I implemented now in WP server and it was pretty pretty good in fact and the very interesting thing is that the cross encoder which is the second part is not very expensive when as a second phaser you just have to re-rank 10 a few a few results and I surprisingly it's almost uh you don't feel the the labs it's as as fast as it would so the difficulty being the same that means how you evaluate in fact your your results apart from a few tests you made manually you have you are you are a woocommerce owner so you know what are your big queries uh so you immediately uh you test you test them because they are your best sellers so you testimony leave that okay if only one of the time of your best salad is not good uh I don't want that that's that's the test basically for for small business to me to uh to meet business and that that's also an interesting interesting subject because if I remember your your post podcast uh mostly it's about something which is uh people you you were talking about with it's about Custom Custom Solutions uh so more I hand the market which is completely different from from the smaller small business so for this kind of um Market I handle there's no question because they have all the infrastructure all the resources money and people and consultants and the event that probably the higher people from with yet from uh from the AI community and experts on Bianca and so on uh but that's not a question at all with uh with WordPress and the woocommerce it could be because they are very big uh sites and biggest in the world which are WordPress or woocommerce so even if it's woocommerce or WordPress they don't really care about the it's not an issue for them I mean for the self owners and and so on so in that sense uh it's a it's a bit a new subject I guess for for for widget uh and I don't know what is the level currently of democratization of of a vectors such I know on my side people are interested but uh it's always with some is it not too difficult but it's the same thing as with the elasticsearch a few years ago for instance now a lot of agencies for instance or agencies are very used to use elasticsearch and Apache solar for instance uh less for hosting vector or databases or uh installing and so on so they have to re do this the thing to retrain and uh and uh rebuild a new service in fact from from scratch uh there are some similarities but I don't think you can test for instance if they had some benchmarks or some tooling for uh verifying that for instance you didn't introduce a regression when you modify the parameter in several parameters in elasticsearch for instance with learning to rank or modify the two parameters in the M25 for instance uh they have some tooling for that because as I said you don't want for instance result disappear completion from your search for a Photoshop so probably it will be a new kind of tool that uh not sure I've seen them until now the the tools led to for instance to do a b testing for instance how do you do happy testing you have elasticsearch and you want to compare to uh to a widget I I had to do that with a with some customers and as I told you the test was very simple uh I remember when owner was able to produce a long list of excel with queries and I took them one by one and compared in several search boxes and this model compared to this model because even with yet it compared several vectorizers uh on the chose one but it was really something on and the head of the search not on the tailor so for the tail I don't know how test can be done and but the most sensitive is a headache if you modify something and your head disappears your shop loses 30 percent of the so that that's important so tool tooling is something that I'm not aware until now or I'll be testing or testing probably the uh a trade-off thing that will appear in the next future when agencies will be more familiar with the I think they are familiar but I'm not sure they are uh at least for mid-market but not small but foreign market I'm not sure agencies are really ready now to to use Vector search completely for these reasons for instance how can I you guarantee a honor that uh it will not suffer from the new search for instance that's that's difficult to to evaluate yeah I think I think the big theme Here is like vector databases versus search engines and and like when you hear Vector databases you might think that we just mean Vector index plus database Cloud that kind of thing but we also cares enormously about this search engine kind of part of it as well and um you know like I'm so happy to hear that you're liking the re-rankers and you're getting use out of it and you know we've had all these great conversations you know mentioned Roman for meta rank doing incredible work and I I think there are currently two only two Vector search is available to to do ranking and re-ranking and eventually ranking and so on so that's that's at the very Forefront uh after the tunability and and so on the number of parameters that you could use perhaps that will be important also in this because was very challenging with Vector database is the fact that it's not uh or search it's not opinionated so even for me uh for the clip model which one will will I use for instance I have absolutely no idea which one to use there's nothing that tells you that uh this model with this number of parameters will be better than this one and the will it run correctly on CPU versus GPU until now for I I could make everything run on the CPUs and so that's that's good news because I don't have to index millions or billions of because often I see for vectors for Vector database of search comparison Benchmark for okay we have another Benchmark for one billion vectors that purely informative probably if you you don't have so many vectors A few thousand for for shop for instance you you can you can survive on CPU that's interesting we're not sure before I was not sure before in fact I've already already read that United GPU somewhere without gpus you were almost dead and in fact it's not so bad of course if you have a thousands of images to index with with a clip model it will take some time but not no okay customers six thousand images and uh I want them it could be it could be slow in fact it was surprised it was pretty fast uh and I didn't have to tweak a bit with yet uh kubernetes yaml files to to put the clip on GPU for instance so I think that there were a lot of progress also in that uh in that area which makes in fact the models usable for for small for small configuration of machines and as an example so if you use a the kubernetes cluster not to pylon mode I'm using Google Cloud it could be another one it's really under uh I'd say 60 dollars a month and on my demos uh on my demos have pretty much everything in that we'll get uh in the view we get to link so I have on it I have a clip several vectorizers the the RPI vectorizers like and so on uh there is even the croissant color re-ranker and I I had no problem so I I don't say that I could sustain I don't know in fact I could sustain 1000 queries per second or ten thousand I I don't know but for let's say a demo and something pretty standard for business small businesses it's a it's surprisingly uh chip the only part which is not cheap is installing it because you need to to hire someone I'd adopt a shop owner will be able to to install the kubernetes cluster it's not difficult but you don't want to do it so in that case the best option is we get customer services and this one is really cheaper than I've seen but yes you it's it's not what I expected a few months ago you can go for it and it's not it's even comparable to some of those things for elasticsearch or if you Auto host your self-host your your widget uh I did not until now I did not need the gpus or anything like that or gpus or other exotic Hardware yeah I think um well I guess like kind of separating to like coming back to the hardware topic I think the like how you mentioned like wanting to Benchmark and compare different embedding models I think it's such an interesting emerging part of the kind of Technology it's obvious it's obviously like you know academic machine learning people almost think of that like first thing is how are we going to test and compare the models but like kind of like I used to like like I like this idea a lot of large language models generate synthetic queries and that gives you a data set to compare models with with like ndcg scores and recall all that kind of stuff I'm starting to also like the idea of like cluster visualization like where you use something like nomic Atlas to like visualize your embedding space and then you can look at the embedding spaces of two models and you can see the like topic uh labels and say like okay I think this one is organizing the space better than the other one but it is so interesting and it's so interesting hearing you as Olivia users say that this is where you think the product needs to evolve into to kind of complete the search engine tooling but yeah so so then into the hardware kind of topic it's it's workflow I'll do well I think it could be survivable but uh the workflow is pretty complex so if we're talking yes uh the idea would be that we would like to we would like to fine tune that ideally we would like to have our model truly adapted even at the if if possible uh even at the vocabulary level uh let's say I'm a pharmaceutical pharmaceutical Pharmaceutical shop selling drugs and I have some pretty specific vocabulary I'm not sure if you use a lot of language model which has not been tuned on you will be able to raise anything the bm25 will be fine except if you're searching by formulas I guess like you then you you count I mean really symbolic like equations or something like that but the M25 would be very good I think in that case because uh the more specific the vocabulary the better it is so there you need to to train it but as you said there are two ways to plenty of West but uh two ideas of training each one is it does manage by itself you have a workflow you have a website you click on a button and somehow again the idea of magic is that you it's difficult because you don't have the the benchmarks how you will you evaluate that you've produced something interesting that's uh we'll we'll talk about T5 and so on for instance and the other way is you mentioned being able to to see the vectors clusters and so on but that requires expertise that will use you have an internal team or a Consultants and uh it's it's a it's a bit uh the same thing as for uh elasticsearch or sorry you have Consultants which are here to evaluate the unit synonyms for instance you will evaluate your your vocabulary and you'll see okay there's there's a cluster here around the fish uh I I would like to have a little bit uh 10 000 Latin name for fishes here around that and they tell you you have to produce them so fortunately you have a consultant who has this so with the vectors that's a pretty similar in fact it's another tooling it's another competence but you have to Cluster in fact your data but that requires money and time and so that's a solution for me as I understand for more high-end or top of the mid Market um the solution I can foresee is the one you mentioned that means synthetic queries so the idea I've seen it several times in papers that's so interesting that I tried to imagine the workflow so the idea is a how do how do you Benchmark something when you you don't have benchmarks in fact so you have to produce your benchmark what do you have currently you have your shop who is a let's say a 100 000 products but you don't have the queries or if you have the query that perhaps they are not so good because they come from uh the analytics and we know there are biases with that you will see only the the head queries and not the tail queries for instance oh yeah um so we we would like because it's a learning to run problem it's a very standard in the search but you need to produce three plates of query product so it can be titled description attribute but product and positive and negative for instance but how to do that without the the biases of of user events user signals and the idea was as you mentioned let's make a general generative AI model General requires from my documents so from my products what let's say I take the titles if they are important and I have a title about the fishes again and I ask a G5 model or other models uh uh to generate one or several queries for me and then I use a vector search to find among these answers which are the the best so I literally I take the 10 queries for instance and the query one does it return what I want to create two and so on and let's say the two or three first are positive and the other ones are negative and then I train across encoder with all these triplets and I use a widget will ranker on my train encoder and that's it but it's I probably the problem will not be the hardware in that case it will be the workflow in fact as I said for small business or let's say WordPress you don't have a fancy Hardware at this position and so and so you will probably be to have some somehow request around so perhaps you can reuse them okay I'm a bit cheating because in fact yes you already have a cluster because you need wheel yet so let's say if you don't use widget on state services um you already have a cluster so perhaps you can use this cluster to install your training and with tools like a Vertex AI for instance so I don't know or again Facebook or not again Facebook to ml and auto training things are similar and uh that would be incredible because imagine imagining that you have a big llm that a croissant color that will be trained from your data and re-injected the automatically on a unfold 10 euros that the uh what I'm not sure is if it's if it's really worth it in terms of quality apparently I've seen some Benchmark it was pretty pretty good but is it better really than the bm25 if you vocabulary very dedicated I am I'm not sure yeah well I think um well if BM 25 is always your Baseline it kind of like what you said your example of something to sleep on right like that's just it kills that I mean I know you know when we talked last when we previously talked you mentioned how a lot of Amazon products they might have like sleep in the title because yeah yeah yeah yes because uh indeed we talked about that Amazon released a few months ago yes I think it's an Amazon uh some a lot of data about query even queries plus results and results are titles if I remember with with the notation uh positive negative or and it appears that that was analyzed I remember now that was analyzing The Meta wrong paper and they they found that if you look at the titles they have been optimized it's it's so that there's so much competition at Amazon that the titles have been optimized so that the all the product description attributes and all the products in in the title so the ones which are important so if you know that uh your fish people are mostly buying fresh fish you will put fresh fish in your title and uh and not just fish and that could explain why perhaps bm25 is so good because if if everything is pretty pretty done in fact for bm25 adapted to bm25 uh uh but as soon as you imagine that you have synonyms and so on uh and you have a data model a model that has been trained on that kind of thing well it's it's difficult to to set so that's an interesting idea of the fact that uh we've yet Perhaps not itself but the the ecosystem of widget could be recursive and be used to retrieve the relevant documents from the generated queries and that is reinjected in the bien codern the bien color is used in in widget uh I I don't know if we yet uh some ideas about that that uh that could be that could be uh that could be interesting because I'm sure that what we get is currently releasing like uh re-ranking uh generative and so on was not in the plans even uh one year ago because it didn't because llms were not a commodity at the time so perhaps this kind of thing the auto training and auto fine tuning and so on [Music] I agree the problem is that there's not a single method to do to do it and tomorrow there will be perhaps a better way to do it it will be done in the model itself Opera there will be a million models pre-trained available so you don't have to do it there will be probably models pre-trained and Fishes so you don't have to do it yourself and and so yeah I guess three things out of that I mean like let me let's I'm going to come back to stay on the fine tuning but quickly the um like building on you mentioned that Amazon people optimize these titles really interestingly I just want to share a quick nugget that you know mod hub from Shopify when he presented at odsc in Boston he told me about how they use uh generative models to help people write titles for their Shopify products so like you know a lot of Shopify is just like everyone across the world selling their stuff and they don't think to write their titles like this so this is that generative feedback loop thing that we talk about and you know like once once llms the inference become so cheap I think it can't be you know I it's going to be exciting how much llms can like augment title descriptions right like just the explosion of content in the miscellaneous ways that takes shape and in this example do you remember if uh was it mentioned if it was more for SEO and that means for attracting new visitors or more for CTR or conversion CRT conversion rate uh that means is there some user signals inside or not because if you generate a perfect because a perfect SEO uh title could be a perfect loser in terms of conversion so if you if you because to attract to attract uh visitors generally you have to be really on the marketing side you have to run face emphasis and sometimes exaggerate the features but when you want to sell it so the visitor is there on your site and they have to to buy it if the if the product is not really like in the description described in the title or just the Wonder contact set a neat title because he has to to provide something which is close so can't accept anything so so Shopify introduce some kind of uh signals in the training for instance of the models and uh well I don't know details like that myself but yeah I just know that high level nugget just and yeah like it was more yeah like so yeah I don't have too many of the details of exactly just like something I heard in conversation that is just like uh related to our topic of like optimize these titles and yeah I don't but yeah what you mentioned about using the CTR and all that could be really it's kind of like it's kind of like the the whole instruction tuning and then like the idea that like right now we're tuning these language models with just this insanely broad did you like this did you not like this but you could like you can fine-tune language models with like any like I think the thing about it is any kind of what we used to call supervised like like how we used to think about supervised learning loss functions all of that can just be applied to the end and you know it sequences sequence with the re like even though it's reinforcement learning it's still kind of the same you don't like supervise every step of the generation but you know see you could optimize llms to do CTR it's just the optimization completely makes sense India so but but the what the other topic about about like training embedding models and ranking models with just a single click where you spend ten dollars and now you have a new model I think it's just like one of the most fascinating things about technology companies is like this what do you build versus who do you partner with and I think all of that is it's just like incredibly unclear to me at least like I know obviously Bob probably has like a really like a better sense of that than I do but like this kind of thing of like okay are we a model training company now and like do we then split our attention between like the vector index the database scaling and you know and integrating search apis to now also thinking about like how do we optimize model training workflows and it's like I I kind of feel like there are so many parts of this like ml Ops picture that I I I think there's a lot to be said to the value of companies focusing on particular things but then like what things merge together over time is like it's so confusing yeah you have to be your opinionated uh so there are on the market some closed uh search solutions for for shopping uh with sometimes with a plugins for woocommerce for instance which have this kind of loop in fact but there's this kind of loop because they are chosen and trained one model in fact so it's a customer wants something else or if it doesn't fit really or perhaps there's a kind of mismatch between his vocabularies is the content of his site and their models what happened in that case and it's usually the it's a it's it can be pretty pretty expensive but which can be explained too because if you have to train and [Music] and but we see in terms of search now we see a convergence that's clear a conversion between search personalized search and recommendations the three uh the three now the three are linked forever I guess and uh so we've seen uh with electricity search we've seen training on learn to rank there are some extensions that in order to introduce uh to introduce signals in the in the models you have reworkers external internal uh there are internal reunctions with some plugins meta rank is an example or okay you you get your results and then you send it to an external system to re-rank with a model which is costly so you don't want to use it in phase one uh uh so that that's really and and it's not only for recommendation it's for if if we imagine a site like Amazon is clear you you need to have a good search you need to have no no result that means you always have to produce something perfect for Vector search it's so it's almost impossible to have nothing with the vector search if you have a big catalog you always have something uh but you have to have personalized results so I've bought that so I'm probably more interesting in that thing that cluster of vectors than this one and your recommendation which are not ready to to your search it's just uh on the bottom and the right okay you you could add that too and and the three are definitely definitely linked uh today and and Vector search is a finally in fact is is a part of that it's a content but there's plenty of signals arriving the problem for me again for more than two years this idea to to introduce personalization and the recommendation in WP server the problem is that you need signals and if I remember for certain providers of recommendation engine and soil sometimes you need for for one for instance you need two million events in the last three months which is absolutely ridiculous for a small business that will not have that in 10 years uh uh and that's probably the limits of these systems it's a it's the market uh is it really that's why I'm really I've not done it because I met prototypes and so on but finally uh are these recommenders uh effective for smaller a small website in fact uh do you need Android thousands tens of thousands and uh other signals to to use it and search engine recently announced the vector search I went to there I went to their site and I read the documentation and in fact to have the vector search you needed to send user events that means either you have keywords hello either you have a vector search but you need to introduce because probably that's this merging for recommendation for personalization you need to have events and finally in fact you are using Vector search to uh to have a better content yes better vectors but you you have to function them with your your events so some have already chosen to to merge everything and some are not even delivering in fact are not even delivering a vector search without the event and another example or that you could so provider providers reads or vector search recommendation and personalization but some features are not available if you don't send the user events for instance the subjections you're starting to type something and you want a list of keywords similar you can't have them I don't know why you contact them if you don't send user events so that's a feature for instance you probably that will never be in Adobe salary because there's too many too many events that are required to do that and and in that two cases it's it's a bit strange for me to understand why Vector search is so merge with uh with events that in fact you can't produce one without the other yeah interesting I mean I think um yeah he well I do think with the zero shot model like I I also used to think this way that I couldn't imagine like having a vector like a latent space in a deep learning model without some kind of training on your data but now clearly the zero shot models from like open AI code here they clearly get you like some of the way there but the question I mean closing the loop with the fine tuning yeah it does all sound so interesting and it's definitely interesting to see how the you know how the whole Market of all this is um you know shaping out further well yeah awesome Patrice I think this was a really great coverage of all these search engine topics and just getting understanding what you're building the nuances of you know just getting into the details of hosting and cloud services and kubernetes and all this cool stuff and then you know your perspectives on search engines and how the Market's evolving is just gold I think this is you know expert level Insight of someone who is like you know on the front lines of building it and so yeah thank you so much for joining the
