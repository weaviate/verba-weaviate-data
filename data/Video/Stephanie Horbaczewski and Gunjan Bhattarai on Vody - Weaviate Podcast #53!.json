{"text": "Hey everyone, thank you so much for watching the 53rd episode of the Weaviate Podcast!! This episode features Stephanie ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching another episode of the wevia \npodcast I'm super excited to welcome \nStephanie horvachesky and gunjan \nbhataraii from voting we've been \nfollowing on with voti for a long time \nalleviate they're building all sorts of \nsuper exciting things with multimodal AI \ncombining different modalities from text \nand images this kind of idea so this \npodcast is going to dive all into that \ntopic and learn about what voting is \nworking on so Stephanie and gunjan \nfirstly thank you so much for joining \nthe podcast \nthanks so much for having us found out \nyou were one of our first startup \nfriends we're really excited to be here \nyeah thanks so much \nawesome so could we start off with the \nthe story of voti the problem that's \nsolving in the founding vision \nyeah definitely um so I'm a second time \nfounder my first business uh was a \nhundred million dollar a year business \non top of Google and Facebook that \nworked entirely with unstructured data \nso when Bert came out I I grabbed a \ncouple of my technical team and left um \ninvested some of the money I made and \nstarted a research company we did three \nyears of projects working on embeddings \nuh worked with Comcast HBO moved into \nretail with Nike and then spent a year \ndeveloping our product with Wayfair \nwow amazing \nyeah I'm so so if we could pack unpack \nthat a little bit so you're already \nworking with kind of uncerted data you \nsaw the Burt Revolution and then you \ninstantly said multimodal is next I \nthink or was it you grew into multimodal \num you know what really happened is I \nsaid recommendations are bad and why \num I didn't understand I felt like there \nwas a ton of data and it didn't make \nsense to me that we were returning such \npoor recommendations uh which is when I \ndiscovered that what a customer is using \nto make decisions for example um images \nq a reviews structured data is not um \nwhat's being used to make those \nrecommendations and so I thought if we \ncould bridge that Gap we're going to \nhave some really transformative \nexperiences in e-commerce and so we set \nout to build those specific models uh \nfine-tuned for the e-commerce media \nspace multimodal models to use all these \ndifferent types of data that's so \ninteresting I've been yeah I've been \nlike dabbling with recommendation and \nbuilding kind of like apparel \nrecommendations to illustrate our ref \ndevec feature which is a way that we've \nbuilt in to have recommendations with \nembeddings I recently had odsce listened \nto mod hofthaker describe how they use \nuh embeddings at Shopify for \nrecommendation and you know his \nexplanation of the business impact to \nthat was incredible and understanding \nthe scope of it so could maybe is \nleaving on the business CEO hat uh you \ndescribe new experiences with \nrecommendation can you kind of unpack \nthat a little more \nyeah I mean what's amazing about the \nembedding is it's bringing all of the \nunderstanding about a product so you \nknow \num a real complete human level of \nunderstanding is going back to your \nmodel to make recommendations so you \nknow when you're \num when you're looking for a pink \nfuchsia chair with wooden legs um \nthere's not enough data labeling in the \nworld right now to do that but if you \nhave an actual understanding um of the \nproduct and so imagine maybe you can \ntalk a little bit about um our \nmultimodal product embeddings \nsure so I'll go a little bit further on \nthe fucio chair and be like most models \nsimply don't even have the capability to \nhandle that today and so some of the \ncore concerns of that is for example one \nyou have to detect color \nin a image and that involves Vision at \nthe same time though there may be \nmultiple objects in an image maybe \nthere's something specific in that image \nyou want the color of and so you sort of \nneed to be able to guide the model as to \nwhat you want and that would involve \nnatural language so that's one of the \ncore opportunities in multimodal \npreviously we'd only have some \nunderstanding of how things might look \nfrom an image perspective or a text \nperspective it's like someone who has \npreviously illiterate but had perfect \nvision and then some person who had a \nPhD but was entirely blind and so we're \nable to combine these two extreme forms \nof knowledge into one person and \nbasically have a model that knows all \nthe latest advancements in science and \ntechnology and like all sorts of \ndisciplines but is able to actually see \nand understand how the world looks like \nwith their own eyes so multimodal \nembeddings essentially deliver on that \npromise so the idea is that products are \nmultimodal in nature they have textual \nfeatures for example product \ndescriptions product titles reviews they \nhave images namely the images that \nyou're trying to have someone sell for \nand other details to like various \nmetadata Fields things related to what \nother products people buy maybe some \nproduct videos lots of other things and \nso the idea is if you can jointly align \nthese types of representations together \nand be able to have a model that \nunderstands all these we're able to have \nembeddings that are able to understand \nthese products really well and you can \nunderstand what's similar what's \ndifferent and then people can build \nmodels on top of them and build search \nthat's able to leverage that Newfound \nunderstanding fascinating I want to park \nthe topic of the color tagging thing I \nthink that's really fascinating this \nidea of how you kind of like use \nclassifiers to extract metadata from you \nknow unstructured data that's definitely \na topic as we go into the weeds further \nuh but coming I really want to \nunderstand voting a little better so \nthis decision to do custom embedding \nmodels that's that's a really unique \nangle I think I've seen you know I think \nopen Ai and cohere they offer a custom \ntext embedding model uh right now I'm \nnot like I'm not so sure that the \ntooling on doing a custom embedding \nmodel is is all that strong yet so it \ndoes seem like such an interesting \nMarket category to go after can you \nexplain a little further this kind of \nyou know custom embedding models for \npeople what what that kind of looks like \nyeah so to get these amazing incredible \nopen source multimodal models \num ready to be used in in production \num in an environment in e-commerce um \nyou have to do a lot of things to them \num so you have to you know build \nextensive data sets very specific to \nthis you have to build different \narchitectures for the different \nmodalities \num optimize them for them and maybe \nmaybe you can give them a few highlights \nof what for example we did with our \nfirst model so essentially \num with our first model in order to make \nthese embeddings work we had to First \nunderstand okay \nthese open source models are really good \nat say generic images and text stuff \nthat you can find easily the internet \nstuff on Google Images basic stuff the \nproblem though is that these companies \nusually have very specific domains they \nwork in for example um e-commerce \ncompanies like Amazon or Wayfair have \nvery different requirements of what they \nwant a model to look like then maybe \nstandard Google or Microsoft because \ne-commerce is inherently different from \nstandard multimodal and so a model would \nneed to be domain adapted to be able to \nunderstand what these types of products \nlook like what text when you try to sell \na product looks like how products look \nlike the prices of these things \nbasically there's new details that these \ntypes of models don't understand and so \none of the most important steps is to \ndomain adapt these models so they are \nable to understand e-commerce at a \nmeaningful level and this can be \nextended to basically an industry real \nestate AR VR \nplenty of others so that's one of the \nmost important steps as to what these \nbusinesses need and these types of \nmultimodal embeddings \nthere are other things too \nyeah let's give \nyou understanding what life stage your \nproduct is for what room you might use \nit in what style it might be you know if \nwe look ahead to what you do with \nmultimodal llms imagine being able to go \nto an e-commerce site and generate a \nstyle blog about how you might style \nthis item particularly in your house \nthis weekend Jonathan and I spent a \nbunch of time on mid-journing and chat \ngbt \num you know in essence creating a way to \nstyle some different ways to do our \nhouse and so you know that's really \ngoing to be part of your new e-commerce \nexperience you're not just going to buy \nthe products you're really going to be \nable to understand how to use them in \nyour life and it's gonna be really \nincredible \nyeah that that paints such a compelling \npicture that kind of I've seen like \nthese room GPT things on my Twitter and \nstuff and stuff like that kind of idea \nand we're going to come back to that and \nmaybe as a thing if if you're listening \nand you want to skip ahead to that you \ncan see the chapters in the video but I \nwant to stay on this um custom embedding \nmodels a little further because I think \nthis is such a deep topic like as an \nexample I like to kind of play with \nweeviate by taking these podcast \ntranscriptions and putting them in \nweaving so Stephanie and good John \nyou'll soon be in my data set and like I \nfind with this that yeah like the custom \ntext embeddings are getting me way \nbetter search results than the off the \nshelf any of the off-the-shelf models \nbecause of this you know this specific \nconversation we're having as we start \nsaying things like room GPT clip \ninstruct blip we started saying all \nthese buzzer these keywords and it's \nlike the models the domain adaptation to \nthem can we unpack that a little more \nfor like the multimodal e-commerce case \nlike say I'm like aloe like a you know \nlike an apparel brand it's like the \nparticular style of my clothing is that \nyou're gonna you know start fine-tuning \nthe embedding models on the descriptions \nof the yellow shirt with the yellow \nshirt and then that kind of leads to \nbetter search is that kind of the \ngeneral thinking \nyeah so um I \nI are going to use this as a good is a \ngood way to answer that um so by \ncreating first an embedding of the \nproduct using all of the data you have \nso you have this human level of \nunderstanding about it uh putting it in \nyour weeviate database \num and then eventually creating an \nembedding of the search query from the \nuser and so now you're matching up \nexactly you know it's semantic search \nexactly what they mean and let's take it \nfurther um when you want to start \nsearching and say oh I really like this \nshirt but I want something brighter and \nI want it short sleeve and and it \nunderstands what you mean and is able to \nidentify that or our CEO is just looking \nfor a mixed drink maker um and he \ndiscovered as he looked through them \nthat he wanted it to work outside that \nhe needed it to be able to handle \nalcohol and being able to revise and and \nyou know have it understand that you've \nmade these new \num new decisions about how you want to \nhow do you want to search and how you \nunderstand the product \nimagine maybe you want to talk a little \nbit about \num you know that integration that the \nuse of those two sets of embeddings \nin order to combine such these \nembeddings essentially well first where \nare you going to use these embeddings so \nin the case of something like product \nsearch you have two options essentially \nthe core problem is that search is very \nvery speed dependent and any and every \nspeed optimization is going to be \nessential and if you're even a second \nlate your business has lost millions of \ndollars of Revenue and so things that \nneed to happen is you need to take these \nembeddings usually you're going to take \nyour products get embeddings of each of \nthese cache them and use them in some \nsort of vector database like for example \nweviate and you can use those embeddings \nto be able to figure out what products \nare similar to each other so you can \ntherefore say do on-the-fly \nrecommendations to your customers with \nyour website so that's one valuable way \nin order to do Integrations of course \nthere might be other ways like if you're \ndoing an offline application maybe for \nexample you want to use these embeddings \nto train a model as step noted to detect \nthe style or what room this product \nmight be in and so that might just be \nsomething where you do a data labeling \ntask offline use this model to add \nadditional information pass it into \nelasticsearch or Cloud search or other \ntypes of services like that and \nessentially be able to use that \ninformation on your existing search \nwithout changing anything so the \nIntegrations are going to fundamentally \ndepend on the use case in the case of \ne-commerce speed is usually Paramount \nand so that's going to affect most of \nwhat you're doing but essentially it \ndoesn't look too different from how \nunimodal models like in text or Vision \nwork within the e-commerce space is just \ndumping in a new model and everything \nyou would have used before would be what \nyou would use today since I think \nthere's a great example from the project \nwe did with HBO The \nreally really really relate to \num you know I loved Queens Gambit if I \ngo to HBO and I say hey can you show me \nwhat you have that's most like this \nbecause they're using interaction data \nand very limited structure they don't \nknow what I mean right \num and so building an embedding of all \nfilms and TV shows what we did we were \nable to work with HBO on how would they \nmake recommendations about data that \nthey have no interaction that on will \nthey have a complete understanding with \nthousands of topical and emotional \nattributes then you know these \nembeddings understand the movies the way \nyou and I do next by the way very \nexciting would be to invent the movie \nitself \num but you could use those embeddings \ninitialize your model originally as the \ncontent understanding and then no matter \nwhat we searched for on these platforms \nwe'd be able to see what they have that \num is most like that show \nso enjoy so we're kind of staying on the \nmovie example it reminds me of like um \nso so I think maybe there are two things \nhere there's like where you are labeling \nthe categories as well as just the \nembedding by itself like the The Next \nStep being the embedding of the movie \nitself that just captures all the \nsemantics compared to where you like \nclassify each uh label and then that \nbecomes the vector it sounds like so you \nknow if I take a movie like Deadpool \nright that's like action and also comedy \nso so I have those two labels and like \nit's not horror like and making that \nlabel so that's how you then bootstrap \nlike a collaborative filtering kind of \nthing where where you recommend like in \nthat kind of way so so it sounds yeah \nyeah Bingo um actually genres is \nsomething none of us can agree about we \ncan only agree \non us \nwe'll wear um while that seems like \nhelpful structured data it \ndue to um you know consumer bias and now \nthey have different opinions of what's \nfunny \nso so a lot of it is trending \nclassifiers then as well right then \nbecause you just it's not like the \ncontrast of uh image like you know I \nlike I usually think when I think of \nembedding models I think that you're \ncontrasting it compared to this sounds \nlike you're pretty you're producing \nclassifiers is that correct \nboth so it seems that the community has \nlargely coalesced around using some sort \nof contrast of loss function in order to \ncreate so for example sentence \nTransformers NLP based is done based on \ncontrastive learning and you might also \nfind something like clip or blip or slip \nor all those other Alternatives those I \nmean they all use the same naming \nconvention so essentially all those use \ncontrastive learning in order to align \nimage and text embeddings you can extend \nthat to other modalities as well like \nincluding video and audio like what you \nmight want to do in the context of a \nmovie so contrastive loss is still going \nto be a key part at least in the state \nof the art that I'm aware of classifiers \nmatter too and that the way that you can \nalso structure this contrastive loss as \na classifier like if you want to do \nusing a momentum cue you can style it \nthat way \nclassifiers also matter for example if \nmaybe you have a lot of data that has a \nclassification label and you want to use \nthat in order to inform your learning \nfor example maybe you know that these \ntypes of products belong in this \ncategory or I guess in the context of \nmovies the type of movies belong in this \ngenre this other type of movies belong \nin this different type of genre and so \nyou can use that to sort of partition \nthese embeddings away and that can also \nbe used so I think mostly it's a \ncontrast to problem classification is a \nway in order to get more data to help \nyou can structure a set contrast a \nproblem as a classification one although \nit's one option out of many contrastive \nis a really big problem and of course \nyou can find too many of these \nembeddings in classifier type problems \nwhich we anticipate would be a massive \nuse of these types of embeddings so kind \nof all the above \nyeah really so I think we're starting to \nunpack the meat of how this how the \ntraining happens in the in the fine \ntuning so I guess my first question with \nthat is the thinking around like you \nknow fine-tuning from a foundation model \nand that kind of thinking so does voting \nyou know do you take a pre-trained model \noff the shelf and then start fine-tuning \nit for HBO Nike these or do you train \nyour own like kind of foundation model \nwhere you pre-train it on a massive \namount of data set how are you thinking \nabout that kind of thing yeah so we \nbuild our own data sets we have huge \ndata sets for this purpose um and we are \nbuilding fine-tuned models that are zero \nshot off the shelf so you can come and \ntake them \num there are still a lot of hurdles as \nyou know to overcome in the data space \num and so we are making it uh very easy \nfor our clients to come and take them \noff the shelf we build our own models \nand we fine-tune others a particular \nshout out for me to junan Lee and \nStephen Hoy and the team at Salesforce \nauthors of lip we think their work is \nsuper imaginative and love working with \nit but we work with all models um \nattention made me want to talk about \nsome of our most recent architectures \nsure so I built a bunch lately and so \nessentially some of this might involve \nfor example trying to fuse models \ntogether like for example images and \ntext you want to fuse them you can \neither fuse them right at the beginning \nor at the end when you build a model you \ncan say have some sort of clip-like \narchitecture where you're not fusing \nthem at all you're basically training \ntwo separate models or multiple models \nif you want to extend this to additional \nmodalities and basically have them all \nrepresent similar ideas that are \nrepresented in text or image or some \nother modality that's another option you \ncan also say combine these types of \nideas first use this alignment before \nthen fusing those together that might be \nhelpful like for example if you want to \ndo a primarily image based task and you \nwant to use a text to help guide the \nimage model to an answer that is another \nalternative it really does depend I \nthink most of the decisions end up being \ndependent on client specific needs and \nnamely for example \nsay how fast the model needs to be how \nmuch memory you can use how accurate \ndoes it need to be those types of \ntrade-offs are mainly where most of the \ncustom model building happens because \nunlike an NLP or Vision where there's \nlike so many models and you can use them \nfor like every specific use case there's \nlike a super small quick version that \ngets the job done there are gigantic \nmodels that get you accuracy and pretty \nmuch everything in between but \nmultimodal is so nascent and multimodal \nhas so many different modalities that \nthere simply doesn't exist anything like \nit in open source or even closed Source \nat this point and so we have to build \nthose out a couple domain specific \nexamples um \n[Music] \nburp is a great idea and e-commerce it's \nnot usually the first shot of the \nproduct by the time you get to three \nyou've got a detail shot maybe you even \nhave a size chart right and so taking an \naverage no longer works one of the \nimportant things in the e-commerce is \nyou can't have to retrain this model \nevery time you update your catalog some \nof these guys are updated catalog you \nknow literally hourly and so they need \nto work and so there's you know a lot of \nmaybe that's interesting talk about \nmaybe some of the instructor lip work to \ndo that \nsure so if we want to talk about \ninstruct blip essentially that would be \nsort of like taking these ideas to the \nllm space so gbt4 proved that it's \npossible to build a multimodal llm that \ntakes Vision as input or Texas input and \nis able to generate text based on that \nthere were other types of Works before \nthat like Flamingo and plenty of others \nthat \ndon't come to my mind at the moment but \nsince GPT sort of generated this new \ngenerative wave no pun intended \num there's been a lot of other work to \ntry and say replicate some of those \nInnovations and one of those was \ninstruct blip which first tried to train \nas efficiently as they could a way to \ntake Vision as input and be able to \ngenerate text based upon it in the llm \nworld and then instruct blip was like \nokay let's go take every academic data \nset we can find turn it into \ninstructions and teach this llm that \nknowledge so it can then generalize to \nnew tasks in a zero shot setting that we \npreviously may have not thought about \nsince academic data sets only cover so \nmuch we have a model that can generalize \nsort of like chat gbt can then it can do \na crazy amount of things so that's the \nessential idea it is definitely embody's \ninterest to be able to produce something \nlike that in the e-commerce space and \nfurther compounding that is the fact \nthat every different company in \ne-commerce or say in the case of film \nand TV have different things they want \nto do a Model A model with and so their \ntasks are going to be fairly company to \ncompany \nthat's a problem for us since obviously \nthis is in the consulting firm and so as \na consequence we want to build stuff but \ngeneralizes really well to other firms \nand so this type of instruction tuning \nand having really good zero shot \nperformance that can generalize to new \ntasks that nobody at the firm even \nthought about would be really important \nthe idea of using instruction tuning to \ngeneralize to new sorts of tasks is \nsomething that allows for scalability it \nallows for this model to be used in many \ndifferent cases and makes us really \nexcited about the potential of what \nthese models can be used for \nyeah without a question so there's a lot \nof information that quickly Stephanie \nmentioned the re-indexing as you update \nthe catalog and I just as to just pull \nthat nugget out of the podcast for \npeople listening that's a huge problem \nre-indexing I think we see that all the \ntime and just something to tackle um but \nyeah I want to stay on this you know you \nmentioned gpt4 being able to handle \nmultimodal uh things we saw papers like \nyou mentioned Flamingo we saw uh Frozen \nthis paper that was called like \npre-trained Transformers as universal \ncomputation engines basically that you \ncan just put the image embeddings into \nthe latent space of gbt3 and then it \nseems to be able to just instantly be \nable to reason across the embedding \nspace which is quite astonishing but \nthen yeah so I mean this idea of you \nknow Foundation model training is so I \nthink at the time of recording this \npodcast cohere has just announced raise \nraising like 270 million dollars and so \nthis space is like is emerging so do you \nthink that the foundation model \nproviders for multimodal you know \nwhether it's and there's two things I \nwant to parse out quickly so there's the \ngenerative models the multimodal \ngenerative models and then there's the \ndecision to train embedding models \nversus uh generative models embedding \nmodels versus generative models so can \nwe start with um \nyou know like um like do you think the \nmultimodal foundation generative models \nwill be different from the text models \nyes \nnamely because they're going to have a \nlot more capabilities right so \nfor example yes you can say use clever \ntricks to try and pass a purely text \nmodel information about an image lava \nfor example basically is able to get \nsurprisingly good performance from chat \ngbt which has never seen an image before \nby passing some context on the image \nlike a caption as well as say bounding \nboxes determine what every object is \nthere and the model is surprisingly good \nat creating data and generating it which \nis helpful except there are some \nlimitations of that for example one what \nwe found is that using an object \ndetection based model ends up slowing \nthings down a great deal it's not \nefficient one paper called vilt was able \nto remove that part and claim a 60 times \nincrease in speed from doing so which is \nsuper impressive and there's also the \nidea that these types of multimodal \nmodels because they're able to learn \nfrom each other are able to get a much \nmore Vivid picture that is able to \nintegrate these two much better than say \nwhat a text model can do with say some \nclever ways of injecting image \ninformation without training it so for \nexample bring back in something I talked \nabout earlier in the podcast we have \nsomeone who basically only has seen \nimages like with their own two eyes and \nseen the world around them but is \nilliterate and then we have someone who \nis blind and basically has the knowledge \nof like practically every PhD in the \nworld being Visionary those two \ncollaborating together is going to be a \nvery difficult way to like work together \nthey're not going to be nearly as good \nas if one person had those capabilities \ntogether and the idea about having a \nmulti-moon model is you want to have \nthat one Superstar person who can see \nthe world and know everything about it \nand have the knowledge of all Wikipedia \nas opposed to two people with these \nextreme split apart skills trying their \nbest to collaborate so that's the \nopportunity in multimodal I'm being be \nable to combine those two together \ninstead of just limping your way with \ntwo extremes \nexactly the way you are as a consumer \nKinder right when you're looking at \nbuying a product you're understanding \nthat structured data the price Etc while \nlooking at the style and the image and \nwhat it's going to look like and you are \nprocessing them in the same space and so \nit's the same idea \nyeah brilliant I I agree fully with that \nthat certainly there's something to be \ndoing the multimodal optimization I and \nyeah I think just that just that putting \nimage embeddings into a text model the \nfact that that works at all is already \npretty astonishing right and now \nsurprised \nyeah I think you know like how how could \nyou have a good sense of audio or like \nhow you know songs sound from a text \nspace it doesn't make any sense so \ncertainly like that example is obviously \nVisual and that makes sense too so could \nwe take apart that other thing the \ndecision to train embedding models \nversus generative models in this space \nof being a foundation model provider \nyes building a model Library where we \nactually have a model roadmap to do all \nthe things we're talking about \num I think probably the answer to that \ncomes more from the startup Enterprise \nMeetup which is um what is the more \npressing need and and you know um right \nnow we're building the models so that \nthey can get more out of the models \nthey've already deployed by including \nmore data in them and so \num while working towards um sort of the \nfuture of introducing some of those like \na multimodal llm and the product \nfeatures you would need to build to \nsupport that model on the site is even \ndifferent than the work right \nyeah so essentially \nembeddings in general tend to serve two \nkey different purposes embeddings well \nhas a unique advantage of you'll be able \nto build services on top of them without \nchanging it like if you want to do \nproduct search and recommendation or \nmovie search and recommendation you can \nuse these embeddings do semantic search \nbe able to Cache them in a vector \ndatabase so that you can do efficiency \ngains and that tends to be the best way \nto do things to sort of speed limited \napplications \num embedding is also the advantage that \nyou can train task specific models have \nmuch more smaller ones that are faster \nand that would be the core advantage of \nembedding based models generative models \ntend to be much larger they are much \nmore generalizable are able to do a \ncrazy amount of stuff that even people \nwho are well familiar with them still \nget astonished with every single day and \nthat is a valuable advantage of them so \nthey can do crazy things can generalize \nto a lot of things if you want to like \ncover some new tasks you didn't think \nabout these models can do that with \nastonishing ability so that's the idea \nbehind generative being able to \ngeneralize some new tasks have crazy \ngood performance and sort of like hit \nthat accuracy Frontier for customers who \ncare about it from bettings we're most \nsort of concerned with more traditional \napplications speed related things and so \nit's sort of like a dichotomy where \ndifferent customers are going to want \nembeddings of different ones they're \ngoing to want generative just depending \non what their specific use case are they \ndon't really overlap simply because it \nseems that most businesses have very \nspecific kpis they need to hit and they \ntend to already be pretty demanding on \nthem and one does not really work for \nthe other and vice versa yeah it's so \nfascinating I think um \nlike a couple notes I had for first day \nI was thinking about how we're talking \nabout kind of classifiers as well as \nsort of the more open-ended like \nsimilarity search or generative and I \nthink there's this paper called set fit \nwhich is about how you fine-tune \nembedding models for classification and \nit's more efficient and really \nefficiency and the cost of these things \nthat's the big topic I want to stay on a \nlittle further I think training \nembedding models embedding models \ngenerally aren't that big models like I \nthink the open AI Ada they have some \nembeddings that come from that big model \nbut I think mostly uh embedding models \nthey're not big models correct like you \nknow like around 100 million parameters \nand this is the typical scale we're \ntalking about \nis that correct \nwe could go a little bit smaller than \nthat too the most popular I wanted \nhugging faces like the smallest mini \nalbum It's like a 21 million parameters \nbut you're right essentially embedding \nmodels tend to see saturation \nthink you don't get more than 300 400 \nbut honestly it's been a long time since \nI've checked the hugging phase \nleaderboard and so uh viewers are more \nthan welcome to go check and figure out \nwhat the true numbers right now but \nthere seems to be a saturation point \nwhere you don't really get better \nembeddings after getting Beyond some \nspecific model capacity would suggests \nthat embeddings are not necessarily that \ndifficult or else only speaking for a \ndeep learning model to learn and so \nbut they don't really get any benefit \nfrom additional parameters generative on \nthe other hand keeps on going better and \nbetter for is \nlarge as I've seen I haven't seen like \nany saturation point in generative yet \nmaybe some people at open AI have found \nsomething maybe that's why they haven't \ngone past 175 billion although maybe \ngbt4 is larger I don't know maybe \nsomeone does would love to know \num but yeah it just uh embeddings tends \nto hit a saturation point where they \ndon't get better probably because \nembeddings and understanding something \nis a much easier task than being fluent \nin writing entire essays on some really \nrandom topic which Chachi BT does great \nyeah that that to me is just one of the \nmost interesting topics because like you \nknow if you're someone who's been \nstudying deep learning for the last few \nyears and you have all these skills \naround like training models and ml Ops \nand all that kind of stuff I think \ntraining embedding models is the \nopportunity because they're smaller \nscale you can iterate you can apply all \nthe clever training tricks like as you \nmentioned like programmatic labeling and \nknowledge distillation this is more of \nan opportunity to apply that and so this \nbrings me into kind of like my hot take \nwe'll see how well this ages like I I've \nbeen thinking a lot about like this new \nclass of like zero shot you know the \nretrieval augmented generation kind of \npipeline where the GB the reasoning part \nand the reasoning part in the search \nmodels they're like separate and you \ndon't think about training the zero shot \nreader model and you only would think \nabout training the search models do you \nthink that that kind of Paradigm that \nthat will be the way going forward \nbecause like I guess the alternative \nview is that as it's getting cheaper to \nfine-tune the language models with say \nlike the Laura low rank adaptation and \nthis kind of thing that the thinking is \nyou don't even need to do retrieval \naugment to generation you could just you \nknow fine tune the language model or you \nknow the multimodal generative model on \nyour particular domain compared to this \nother setting where you're just updating \nthe search models and you keep the zero \nshot generative model fixed do you think \nthat'll be the way going forward so I \nmean there are very easy ways to build \nthat today and it's something that's \ngoing to be very common in applications \nI myself use that to great effect which \nhas been very fun \nI am leery about making predictions of \nwhat happens going forward since \nhonestly my track record of predicting \nthe future is less than I would like I \nwould be persuaded that a \nretrieval-based augmentation system \nwould help for example Bard is using \nthat chanchi BT in their plus form has \nused that through the formula plugins \nand it seems like people are going in \nthis type of Direction I think in this \ncase uh you're more talking about \nsituations where you have a bunch of \ndocuments or a bunch of \nproducts or a bunch of movies and you \nsort of want to pick the one that's most \nrelevant to feed into your llm or \nwhatever is doing this generation and \nthat I think is going to be valuable as \nlong as say attention remains expensive \nand there have been some massive \nInnovations in the space for the last \nfour months this has been something I've \nbeen following really closely I've seen \nmore valuable stuff in an exponential \nPace in the last four months than I saw \nin the last three years \nand I'm just astonished and so \nmaybe these types of things may become \nless relevant as attention becomes more \nefficient and can generate up to like a \nhundred thousand tokens two hundred \nthousand into these types of crazy \nnumbers but those are also complicated \nto build out and I don't see these \nsystems integrating that for at least a \nfew years thanks to the fact that \ndiffusion of innovation takes a while \nand so maybe that because of that I can \nsee this how Paradigm being useful for \nthe next few years at least and even \nwith like these efficient form of \nattention they are using retrieval as \nwell so they're trying to retrieve from \na database in order to try and make \nthings more efficient so maybe even the \nfuture of attention which is supposed to \nsolve this problem will literally be \nusing retrieval in order to solve it so \nwe might see it just go in a different \nway we'll just change our idea of \nattention and I think retrieval is \nvaluable and maybe that'll even become \nthe future of attention I'll just stop \nat that \nyeah there's quite a lot I mean like \nthere's like the if we want to like \nstaying on this topic of like the Retro \nmodels where you're doing like Fusion in \ndecoder and you put embeddings directly \ninto the attention layer and you know I \nthink we also took our top like there's \nlike the Laura there's like the sparse \nfine tuning that just makes it easier to \nfine-tune the existing language models \nand then we're coming into like these \nnew models like mosaics MPT or the \nanthropic Cloud that they're like they \nare designed to take massive input \nwindows and I think that complements \nretrieval quite nicely but sort of \nstepping outside back into our \nrecommendation hat I'm curious with this \nperspective on recommendation with uh \nembeddings and then because the way that \nI see right recommendation that it's \ntypically been done by these symbolic \nranking models where you take like you \nknow features about Conor like mail \nlikes basketball maybe that's a feature \nI like basketball but like and then you \nwould have features for each of the Nike \nproducts and so you'd feed these into \nlike XG boost and rank them do you think \nthose kind of models are still valuable \ndoes everybody think about training \nthose kind of models \nso I do think they are valuable for \nexample one focus of ours is to look at \nstructured data fields seeing they have \na lot of context and those structured \ndata fields tend to align quite nicely \nwould say \nperson is male and like these specific \ntypes of like \nI'm in an opioid heart bag of words \ntypes features \num so essentially I do think that's \nstill going to be valuable I think at \nleast in the context of e-commerce and \nmaybe like things like Netflix \num it goes beyond say content-based \nembeddings and you also have to start \nconsidering what other people want and \nthat would or what people want and what \nsimilar things are what similar movies \nsimilar products that tends to be really \nvaluable to do recommendations in this \nspace and so I think recommendations are \ngoing to be happy on that but in order \nto even process and understand that \ninformation effectively your model needs \nto have the full picture of like how to \nuse that information it doesn't matter \nif you have like a billion like clicking \nof your movies if say you don't know how \nto use them like if all I know is \num movie name title and I'm trying to \nfigure out clicks of like a billion from \nthat I don't have much information even \nlike fine patterns but multimodal \nbroadens that scope a lot and now I can \nuse say specific parts of that movie I \ncan use images the trailers the um \nentire transcript now I'm able to \nbroaden what I'm able to use to process \nthose people that like a billion people \nthat clicked on your movies to be able \nto make recommendations so \nthis doesn't really change the fact that \nseeing what other people want and seeing \nhow similar you are to other people that \nis still going to be valuable but what \nmultimodal allows you to do is be able \nto take that information and use a lot \nmore of it than you were able to \npreviously so broadening The View yeah I \nthink um well yeah for sure it seems \nlike the the embeddings from the \nproducts alone can get a lot of that \nsymbolic data out of it and then it's \ngetting so good that it captures it all \nlike if I click on a few pictures of \nlike I'm on Nike and I start clicking on \nlike LeBron James shoes or like a Kyrie \nIrving t-shirt and now it can pick up on \nall these other kind of features for me \npretty quickly so earlier we mentioned \nroom GPT and that we come back into that \ntopic later on so I'm tagging it now so \num this kind of idea where you you know \nretrieve and then generate like \npersonalized retrieval so you know I \ntake Connor and maybe using the Wii V8 \nreftube example just because this is how \nI think about it but you know like I'd \nhave Connor and I like this you know \nLeBron James shoes Kyrie Irving t-shirt \nI average those vectors and then that's \nthe counter vector and so now I like \nsearch for the new uh the new products \nand then I would and then I would feed \nthose new products into like a \ngenerative model where it's like a \npicture of me and it like you know puts \nthe shirt on me stuff like this how are \nyou think about that kind of like uh you \nknow personalized generation I hope I \nset up the question correctly but this \nkind of thing where you like to come \nback to the room gbt it's like I take a \npicture of my uh you know my living room \nand then the new products come in as a \nbig catalog of like a thousand Wayfarer \nyou know tables and stuff and then first \nit ranks it by using the Connor vector \nand then it puts it in my room so I can \nsee what it would look like in my living \nroom \nthat kind of thing yeah so I find room \nGPT interesting more so because it uses \ncontrol net which I found interesting \nsince you're able to condition that \ngeneration of say what you want a room \nlook like and be able to better control \nhow say your text to image model works \nthat I find is really interesting of \ncourse this is relatively nascent and \ncontrolling that is a relatively new \nmodel I mean I think 1.1 came out \nrecently but so I think it's going to be \na very interesting space going forward I \nthink there's going to be a lot of \ninnovation I think it's cool right now \num definitely in the context of say \ne-commerce you will want to like when \nyou know what room something wants to \nbelong in maybe there's multiple \nvaluable rooms that a object might be \nrelevant in like lamps can be in \ndifferent types of rooms and so if you \ncan use the sort of like text image \ngeneration with control net or I guess \nmore generally room GPT you'll be able \nto or retailer could easily just take \nthis and \nchange their lamp in a living room to \nmaybe a lamp in a dining room or in a \nbedroom all with using a simple model \nand \nI'm sure that would be a very valuable \nplace for being able to sell these types \nof products in a way that more is \ncustomized with customer needs so I \nthink it's really valuable I think it's \nreally new research and I'm excited to \nsee say what's going to happen the next \nfew months because I think A lot's going \nto happen I think you'll be able you'll \nbe able to to index a little lower on \npersonal information right so like we \nwon't \nyou're putting in a room and you \nunderstand so much more about every \nsingle product that's in the room and if \nyou're saying hey what could I put on \nthis wall right you'll be able to use so \nmuch more context from the image itself \nand rely Less on the user you know \nNetflix does some incredible work with \nembeddings if everybody wants and wants \nto read more on their blog um you know \nand they're they're able to look at \nviewing patterns so you know again \nthousands of of topical and emotional \nattributes and and say uh cut different \ntrailers to show different audiences \num reorder they're they're even \npersonalizing the order you see \ncarousels in right by using all this \ninformation and so it's it's not as \nreliant on um \nparticular user data but but on how much \nmore data they can use to create these \nexperiences \nyeah that I think that paints such a \ncompelling picture especially because \nyou know if you you no longer need to \nhave this Treasure Trove of data right \nbecause the zero shot model from voting \ncan look at the picture and then extract \nall as you mentioned like if it takes a \npicture of my living room we'll see my \nother furniture and like get a sense of \nmy style I suppose like yeah as because \nbecause it sounds like quite the \nbusiness change like if I'm like I think \nI think a lot about this thing of like \num who should Implement search like \nshould you know aloe that I mentioned \nearlier should they be thinking about \nlike we should have our own we should \ncontrol our own search on our website or \nshould we like use Amazon I think in the \npast you'd want to use like Amazon of \nthese big players because they had all \nthis interaction data and that was like \nthe only way to do it but now because of \nthese embedding models that as you \nmentioned can just take a picture you \ncan get a sense of your style instantly \ndo you think more Brands will be \nthinking like I'm cutting out the \naggregation platform I'm going to you \nknow build this right into my website \nand manage this kind of advanced \ntechnology myself \nyes my answer to that would be um two \nparts one is um like the distribution \nchannel the fact that they have the \naudience on some of these bigger \nplatforms \num is sort of one piece but when you \nflip the side of um being able to \ncontrol more of their own on-site \nconversion um you know 75 of Revenue and \ne-commerce is lost from abandoned \nshopping carts um so if you don't know \nyou have duplicate products you're \nshowing a user they're gone if they you \nknow confused about what they're looking \nat they're gone right \num so I think being able to use all of \ntheir own data that we're using to make \npurchase decisions to personalize an \nexperience for us they don't need to \nknow as much about me anymore they now \nhave use of the data that I was using to \nmake the first decision so I think it \ncan really you know transform how they \npersonalize your home screen experience \nto how they show your objects I mean I \nimagine one day where they know I bought \nthis shirt so the next time I open you \nknow skirts that I'm seeing it with this \nshirt so now I'm imagining my own closet \nright like you can get to that point \nwhere so YouTube you can kind of mix the \npersonalization \num \nwith what we were saying earlier which \nis not needing it because you have such \na great understanding of the product so \nyou don't need to know the product the \nuser as well \nyeah I agree that's I hadn't thought \nabout that before but that is cool that \nit like uh it has your closet in so it \ncan orchestrate it that way see what see \nwhat you're missing from the closet and \num yeah I mean it's like um I'm curious \nabout this kind of uh it's more of a \ntechnical topic but this kind of like \ndiversity and recommendations and how \nembeddings achieves that because these \nmodels are trained for similarity and to \nshow you similar things to what you \npurchased so how would how would a \nsystem work that shows you some things \nyou you know like because like a lot of \nexperiments with ref as I mentioned like \nwe're averaging the Lebron James Kyrie \nIrving stuff we average that vector and \nso you know we're just going to get that \nhow do you think about diversity and \nrecommendation with embeddings \nyeah so think about like cart filling \nabout the product \nI want to show them more hammers or \ndifferent hammers you want to show them \nNails you want to show them whatever \ngloves you'd use whatever other tools \nyou use with a hammer right so some of \nthat understanding yeah um I think you \ncan get diversity from a lot of \ndifferent ways so I guess we're talking \njust about embeddings and like these \ntypes of encoder only models so to speak \num you can achieve this by for example \nchanging up Dropout a little bit you can \nsort of like maybe provide some sort of \nlike noise context to these types of \nmodels which I don't think is something \npeople do but it's entirely something \nthat's like theoretically possible if \nyou want to take the idea from like Gans \nso that can help \num you can also change the way that \nyou're doing similarity maybe if you \nwant to um you're taking the top 20 most \nsimilar things rather than going one two \nthree four five six seven you can sort \nof like switch up that order a lot of \npeople use like a buy encoder cross \nencoder type framework and just changing \nup the way you use that might help \nadding more context so you can create \ndiversity recommendations simply by \nchanging up your inputs maybe changing \nup the model a little bit or even like \nchanging the way that you like \npost-process things so getting that type \nof diversity is something that you can \npretty much Tinker with at pretty much \nevery stage of this overall \nrecommendation Pipeline and so \nultimately I think that's something \nthat's going to be up to say the \nindividual users like the companies that \nare integrating these models and these \nPipelines \ninto their products \nyes Stephanie you mentioned like baskets \nand good Judy also mentioned this idea \nof like what the similarity function is \ncapturing and I think that's quite an \ninteresting idea because you know \ninitially when I was thinking about this \nI was thinking usually with clip models \nyou like have an image and then you have \nits description and then you're you know \ntrying to make that similar but another \nway to train these models would be to \nopt like the positives come from they're \nin the same basket together and then \nthat way the function doesn't just like \ncapture similarity captures like this \nkind of like we have this relationship \ntogether like we're in baskets together \nbut then I think with the basket the \ntraining of the models is like how would \nyou kind of bootstrap the data for that \nwithout again coming back to that \nproblem where you you need to be like \nAmazon and you have this massive \ncollection of basket data \nsure \num so the idea is you can use a larger \nmodel to try and improve sample \nefficiency that would be one step now if \nyou're trying to compete with the \nbillions of data Amazon has you're \nprobably gonna have to be creative and \ntry to like go back to like the \ncontent-based space and try to like \nreally richen up your content-based \nembeddings incorporating multiple what \nwill be a great step since these Source \nrecommendations simply don't use that \nright now \num using multilingual which as I've \nnoticed is something that even Amazon \nstruggles with which was a really big \nsurprise that I saw one month ago when I \nwas exploring things and so trying to \nbuild better content-based embeddings is \na way if say you don't have Amazon's of \nvoluminous data in order to try and \nlevel up the playing field that would be \none step and of course by \ntrying to figure out what type of \ninformation is valuable that way if you \nhave really good content recommendations \nthat itself was might drive some users \nand be able to help you sort of like get \nthat interaction data that'll further \nimprove your models and so obviously \nit's going to be difficult to go up \nagainst Amazon but most of these \nretailers that are like trying to build \nthese sorts of models maybe more Niche \nor more specific to types of areas and \nso they don't have to compete with \nAmazon everywhere it doesn't matter what \nAmazon's pillow data is if you're \nselling bricks for example like that \ntype of correlation simply isn't going \nto matter too much for your products so \nif you focus on the things that you are \ntrying to sell and try to get really \ngood embeddings and content on that and \ntry to get interaction data on that \nspecific set of products and it'll be \nfine like if you're a boutique retailer \nthat only like sells 35 different items \nit doesn't really matter of like \nmillions of people use Amazon you just \nneed a ton of data on those 35 products \nand you're seeing a really understand \nyour 35 products really well with your \nmodels and then you should be set so I \nwouldn't worry too much about competing \nwith Amazon unless you're literally \ntrying to build the next Amazon in which \ncase well I don't know much about that I \ncan't really provide any advice \nyeah I think it well I think this is \nrelated to this concept of like you know \nthe embedding models they're between 20 \nmillion to 100 million parameters and \nlike being clever with the training \ntechniques like I'm sure I'd vote you \nyou know you have a ton of expertise on \nlike how you train these kind of models \nand that's a emote and I think it's a \nvery interesting kind of startup to \npursue for people who've been studying \nmachine learning and the reason I'm \nsaying this is we're talking about this \nkind of how you're doing the similarity \nwhere you're getting the data from this \nkind of sampling of the positives and \nnegatives I think there's so much \nopportunity to innovate in how you \nsample positives and negatives and learn \nthese kind of models and one idea I've \nbeen thinking about and I'm curious if \nyou have as well as like these kind of \nlike graph neural networks where you \nhave like user and then like you know \nlike put it in a basket or and then you \nalso have a graph like these items they \nshare the same brand and that could be \nsomething as like a clever training \ntechnique right that maybe you'd \nuniquely offer \nyeah it definitely is valuable \num graph networks have been valuable in \ntrying to like use interaction data in \nparticular for example since seeing the \nsequence of like the products you might \nuse has been something that I think has \nbeen historically of Interest \nTransformers themselves can be \nconsidered some sort of graph networks \nand that the attention itself is some \nsort of graph I do think it's valuable \nespecially for the interaction data it's \nnot something that I am particularly \nstrong in but it's definitely been \nsomething that \nlooking at yeah super cool I I yeah I do \nthink that with the graph of nuts I \nguess I don't know it's like because I \nthink a lot about we we like we've was \noriginally a Knowledge Graph technology \nand so this we still have these like \ncross surfences between the classes and \nso \nI like to think a lot about how you can \nmaybe send embeddings through the graph \nto get better embeddings for your \nparticular context that's kind of what \ninspires me to think about this kind of \ngraph neural network thing but so anyway \nso I I think it was a great coverage of \nyou know getting into the meat of how \nthe models are trained \num maybe kind of a wrapping up topic \nwould be just like what is on the \nhorizon of multimodal that you're you \nknow that's immediately in front of you \nas well as something that maybe is like \nthree to five years out \ndifferent timelines \nI think that having models that \nunderstand multimodal like among text \nimages and then maybe uh domain specific \nmodalities like structured data click \nstream videos audio what have you that's \ngoing to be something that's going to be \nseen more and more across Enterprise AI \nmaybe not necessarily academics since \nthese types of things matter more from a \nbusiness application and so you'll see a \nlot more of that at least the company's \nhoping for that \num you'll probably also see a lot more \nof these types of multimodal models be \nused for Generation capabilities \ndefinitely there's going to be a lot of \ninterest in the next few months as long \nas generative way continues but even \nwhen all the dusts and hype Settles \npeople will realize that being able to \nuse all these different modalities and \nbe able to generate texts like for \nexample if I don't know Amazon or \nWayfair want to build a chatbot to like \nanswer customer queries something like \nmulti-modal is going to be very valuable \nfor that so those are the two areas that \nat least I think that multimodal is \ngoing to be very valuable for um these \ntypes of companies in the next two years \nwe're expecting tons of adoption of this \nand we expect it to completely Turbo \nCharge and change the way that people do \nrecommendations and maybe even off of a \nstretch like something like Bing chat or \na chat GPT plugin people can simply \ninteract with say a chat and be like \nask for a product to be found and then \nwe can even automate product search so \nthat rather than you having to sift \nthrough like 10 products and try to find \nthe right thing you can just talk to \nthis model and it'll just automatically \nbe able to generate say the product that \nyou're looking for have a simple click \nbutton to like pay for it in one click \nand then you're done and so that I think \nis one particularly exciting application \nof multimodal LMS being able to use like \na Bing chat type application in order to \nlike automate large parts of product \nsearch so that well I mean we already \nhave models that can search the web \nbetter than a human can at least that's \nthe idea behind being chat why not have \nsomething like that that can search for \ne-commerce products better than a human \ncan and then probably save a lot of us \nso much time so that's something all \nthose things are things I'm really \nexcited about for the next few years \nI share his excitement on that side I'd \nsay what else I'm excited about is just \nthe ability to actually get any of this \ndone right so thank you to our startup \nfriends like you guys \num you know and actual ml offering \ninference like you're there there's \nreally going to be it's going to be much \neasier and the cloud platforms and the \nInvestments they're making to do all \nthis work to use these models to be able \nto use these embeddings and get them \ninto into production and I think that's \nyou know in the next couple years that's \none of the things I'm most excited about \nawesome and so just one more thing \npicking apart your brain particularly \nStephanie being the CEO and building \nbusinesses I'm really curious how you \nsee uh kind of the space of Open Source \nwith this topic if you think about like \nI'm curious how companies like yours uh \nuh you know offer this kind of like \nmodel training for particular companies \nhow you then also think about open \nsourcing some of the stuff you do and \njust how you see that yeah so super \nimportant topic to us um all this work \nis because of Open Source right so \num we embrace it we love it right now \nwe're working on sort of \num more limited open source academic \nPartnerships places like that so that we \ncan make sure we're getting the \nappropriate amount of feedback \num and and keeping it out there I think \nour intention \num you know and as you said how do \nthings age so maybe I'll regret this but \nOur intention \num would be that as we continue to \nevolve and release more models we will \nmake some of them open source um and \nwe're working right now on um how we're \ngoing to approach that but for for the \ninterim um embracing it heavily because \nit's advancing our work as we said we're \nusing a lot of Open Source models and \nusing a lot of Open Source techniques to \nmake these models work for e-commerce um \nand so we're going to find our way to \ngive back to that we have great data \nsets they're enormous that for example \nthose types of Partnerships so we can \nhelp more of that open source work that \nwe use get published I would say is our \nour first goal that it's so fascinating \nlike the the explosion of Open Source \nmodels I mean \nyeah it's also interesting with kind of \nthe idea of you could take one of these \ncheckpoints from hugging face that comes \nfrom body and then you could fine tune \nit or maybe you already do that kind of \nthing and I know talking to Brian about \nunstructured and how they're doing how \nthey're going to train uh Foundation \nmodels for like uh information \nextraction from say like PDFs and visual \ndocuments this whole emerging space of \nthe open source models is also \ninteresting um I have one more question \non that which is like um there's the \nopen sourcing of the model weights \nthemselves but then there's also like \nlike something that I always like hot \ntip to Mosaic ml4 and respect a lot what \nthey did is they open sourced this \ncomposer library and so it's \nimplementations of all sorts of \nefficient uh deep learning techniques \nthat it like like Alibi attention or \nlike stochastic path drop out like all \nthese kind of details of the models what \ndo you think about open sourcing some of \nthe like kind of like the \nyou know the the tricks of the training \nthat goes in as well or just kind of \nmodel weights \nI think there's room for both in that \nsituation now given that Lobby's \nInnovations Alibi attention rotary well \nI don't even know if rotary embeddings \ncounts as an innovation this point so \nmany models use it but essentially \nI think a lot of that's going to be open \nsource before we even like integrate it \nto a model since a lot of the most \nvaluable work in this space has been \nopen source open AI is basically just \ngpt4 was like let's go take everything \nthat's open source available add to gbt3 \nand then make gpt4 in essence and they \nadded some of their own stuff but \nanything they added was very quickly \nopen sourced by a lot of passionate \nresearchers and so \nwe are going to say open up that stuff \nbut by the time we do my guess would be \nthat they're already are going to be \nmultiple libraries out there that do \nthat type of stuff like it wouldn't \nsurprise me with say a Phil Wong lucid \ndreams it's a crazy smart person who \nlike opens horses every model like I I'm \npretty sure like that's still going to \nbe the go-to place \num to find these types of Innovations no \nmatter what save body or any other \ncompany does like \nthere are open source is always going to \nlead the way and \nreally any business is just going to try \nand combine those things to a model \nsimply because there's tons of \nInnovations but they all tend to be like \none specific area one specific paper one \nspecific model combining those is where \nI think a lot of the emote and the \nopportunity lies \nand to your point guard our business \nvery clearly sits in the um you know a \nlot of great open source work not not \nimmediately applicable at a business \nlevel right and so our business isn't \ntaking a lot of this work and making \nsure that it is Enterprise ready \num you know for business applications \nwhich \num you know is \nis a sort of extension of that as I said \nI think you know we'll probably end up \ncontributing before that on how can we \nhelp um Advance some of the work that we \nthen use \nyeah fantastic \num awesome Stephanie gunjan that was \nsuch an incredible coverage of all these \ntopics um I learned so much about \ntraining embedding models all the things \nhow you're seeing the space um as we're \nwrapping
