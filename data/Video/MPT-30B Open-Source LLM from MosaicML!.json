{"text": "Hey everyone! This video dives into MosaicML's new MPT-30B open-source large language model... with a commercial license! \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching weave it on YouTube I think we \nhave one of the most exciting recent \nbreakthroughs in large language models \nAi and deep learning technology Mosaic \nml is open sourcing with a commercial \nlicense the MPT 30 billion parameter \nlarge language model so we have three \nmodels that have been published the MBT \n30 billion that's the pre-trained model \nthat's been trained by language modeling \nit has absolutely gigantic scale of uh \nText data and then we have two uh tuned \nmodels from that checkpoint MPT 30 \nbillion instruct and MPT 30 billion uh \nchat so two different ways of continuing \nthe training with label data and that \nkind of thing for training from the \ncheckpoint so right off the bat about \nthe checkpoint obviously the open \nsourcing of that with a commercial \nlicense that's probably the thing that \njumps out the most when you read a \nheadline like this but there are all \nsorts of interesting details behind this \nwhether you want to you know take that \ncheckpoint and start sampling from it to \nlabel your own uh you know your own \nfeedback preferences to then continue \nthe training on Mosaic ml's training \nCloud all sorts of interesting details \nof what you can do with with the open \nsourcing of the pre-trained base model \nand then of course what you could do by \nyou know plugging in the 30 billion \ninstruct model into your application so \nthe 30 billion chat model has been \npublished with a demo so we can get a \nquick sense of the the intelligence of \nthis thing by you know curing it on hug \nand face spaces so let's ask it please \nwrite a short \ndescription of how approximate nearest \nneighbor search works so you know we can \nyou know test its intelligence on how \nyou can face faces and get a sense of \nhow this works so it's hosted with the \nMosaic ml inference API so quickly the \nMosaic ml inference API is super \ninteresting development with Mosaic and \nmakes it super easy for us integrating \nit with weaviate is they also have this \nkind of like inference as a service API \nwhere if you're used to weavate we have \nlike a generative open AI generative \ncohere generative palm and so pretty \nsoon we'll have generative Mosaic ml \nthat lets you do this kind of connect to \nthe infrared service using your API key \nand you know running that and all the \nsearch results in parallel \nand so on so here's his answer please \nwrite a short description of how \napproximate nearest neighbor search \nworks approximately nearest neighbor \nsearch is a technique used to find so \nsee I think you get the idea you can \npause it and read it if you like but um \nso one more thing quickly before diving \ninto the blog post where Mosaic ml has \nwritten all sorts of details about how \nthis works it's just such an such a \ndetailed comprehensive overview of what \nit takes to train language models like \nthis and as well as the evaluation of \nthem let's take a look at \nretrieval augmented generation with this \nthing really quick so what were our \ninterests with Vector databases \nSomething That We're super excited about \nwith large language models is when you \ntake a query like you know let's say the \nquery is what is llama index we take \nthat query and we turn it into a vector \nand then we use that to search our \nVector index of text passages that have \nalso been vectorized by doing that um \nyou know Vector distance calculation to \nfind the nearest neighbor and then as \nthe solid the approximate nearest \nneighbor search the mean of that is \nbuilding up the data structures to let \nyou scale that to an absolutely enormous \nscale and not have to do the distances \nbetween every single vectorized passage \nin your text collection but so we might \nask a question like what is llama index \nand then we would hit some data source \nlike say the Eva blog post and we \nrecently have this new blog post from \nJerry Lou Lama index and weviate and say \nthat Vector hits the vectorized the \nvector representation for this text \nChunk we grab that and then we to the \nlarge language model we would say \nsomething like you know please summarize \nthis text and then we give it the text \nRetreat from the vector database there's \na you know please answer this question \nbased on the following text passage all \nthese kind of all these kind of things \nthat you can do with it but we see the \nanswer a lot of index is a data \nframework for building llm applications \nit provides connectors for ingesting \ndata from various sources so you know it \nprovides a successful answer so let's \ndive into the blog post get until the \ndetails behind how the MPT 30 billion \nmodel was trained and evaluated and this \njust super exciting development is the \nopen source large language models and \njust generally the capabilities of these \nmodels continues to evolve all right \nlet's get into the details of it MPT 30 \nbillion open source large language model \ncommercially licensed more powerful so \none of the first things that jumps out \nwhen you read this is 8 000 context \nlength on h100 gpus I believe h100s are \nthe most powerful gpus so it's \nimpressive to have set up that kind of \ncloud infrastructure for all this so \nthey begin the story with uh well \nfirstly you can check out the chat on \nthe hugging face which is what we just \nlooked at so so beginning the story so \nMPT 7 billion this model I think it came \nout one or two months ago and they \ndescribed how in May alone these models \nthe seven billion parameter base \ninstruction tune chat tune and story \nwriter which I think is um you know \nanother specific data set that they \nfine-tuned the 7 billion base on have \nbeen collectively downloaded over three \nmillion times so you know clearly people \nare interested in these open source \nlarge language models there's no you \nknow there's no dancing around that so \nthey to tell a little more about the \nstory of open sourcing the MPT 7 billion \nbase they describe how the community has \nyou know extended MPT with lava MPT \nwhich adds Vision understanding MPT this \nnew ggml inference library that \noptimizes MBT on Apple silicon and CPUs \nand then gbt for all which lets you run \na gbt4 like uh chatbot interface on your \nlaptop using MPC as a back-end model so \nthis is like this private GPT that comes \nwith the UI for your local setup and you \ncan use MPT as that model to run on your \nlaptop so today we're excited to expand \nthe Mosaic ml Foundation series with MPT \n30 billion a new open source model \nlicensed for commercial use this is a \nhuge detail that is significantly more \npowerful than MBT 7 billion and \noutperforms the original gpt3 so pretty \namazing they later describe 17 of the \nparameter account of gbt3 and they use \nabout 60 of the compute budget to \nachieve this so they're also releasing \ntwo fine-tuned variants \nmbt30b instruct and mpt-30b chat we'll \nget into that and what that entails that \nare built on top of MPT 30 billion they \ndescribe I think it's so interesting how \nthey're describing they publish the base \nmodel as well which has been pre-trained \nwith the language modeling as well as \nthese models that have been fine-tuned \nwith that uh instruction tuning the \nwhole reinforcement learning from Human \nfeedback where you have some kind of \ninstruction and a long answer and then \nthe human preference to do like this or \nthe chat conversation interestingly the \nchat conversation model actually isn't \nuh commercially licensed but and I don't \nthink there's detail about exactly what \ndata set that is trained with but that's \nwhere you have multi-turn conversations \nto fine-tune with so but they also \nrelease the base model so if you want to \ntake that 30 billion parameter base \nmodel and then you know I don't know you \nhave some kind of uh instruction tuned \ndata set for your particular thing you \ncould continue training with that base \nmodel and it's one of the most \ninteresting trends that I expect to \ndevelop further with this whole \ncontinued evolution of large language \nmodels so so anyway so there all MPG 30 \nbillion models come with special \nfeatures to differentiate them from \nother large language models so the 8 000 \ntoken context window that's pretty long \nI think you know 4096 is what I think is \ncurrently on the um \non the open Ai apis and obviously that's \nlike 8192 but anyway so uh longer \ncontext via Alibi attention so Alibi \nattention seems to be a big deal so I \nwanted to just quickly highlight this \npaper the title of it train short test \nlong so it's an interesting way that \nthey can extend the context length at \ninference time if you're not interested \nin the full details of like how exactly \nthey modify attention but that's \nsomething they say um like if you look \nat when you're configuring MPT 30 \nbillion you can you know turn it up to \n16 000 contacts window and that's a \nproperty of how this L by attention \nworks I'm personally not an expert on \nthat but just taking out that nugget of \nit quickly so um also you have the um \nthe the pre-training data mixture so \nthey're going to show a table that has a \ncomposition of data sources another \nquite interesting detail and then again \nthe h100s are I think the most powerful \nGPU so this kind of cloud infrastructure \nstuff has been set up so another really \ninteresting thing is that you can deploy \nit on a single GPU so either you would \nneed one a100 with 80GB gigabytes in \n16-bit Precision or one a140 gigabytes \nand 8-bit Precision so the ability to \ndeploy this on a single GPU that's also \nquite interesting because you know it's \nit makes it easier to deal with the um \nthe Computing cluster if you only have \nto have one GPU to deploy the model onto \nso comparable models such as Falcon 40 \nbillion they have larger parameter \ncounts and they can't be served on a \nsingle GPU today so that necessates \nnecessitates two plus gpus you know \nwhich increases the not only you know \nincreases the system cost as well as \nkind of the overhead of how you're going \nto think about doing this so \nsome additional interesting things you \nknow Mosaic ml training if you're going \nto keep trading with the 30 billion with \nyour private data via fine-tuning domain \nspecific pre-training or training from \nscratch I think that is such an \ninteresting detail and will be so \ninteresting to see how that plays out \nthey also have Mosaic ml inference and \nwe're going to dive into that later as \nwell so continuing further into the MPT \n30 billion uh family so they start off \nby saying customers can train MBT models \nefficiently with 40 to 60 percent uh mfu \nso I wasn't exactly sure what this was \nso I checked this out uh super cool \nrepository llm Foundry uh you know I've \nbeen familiar with Mosaic ml's composer \nLibrary composer is an open sourcing of \nall sorts of efficient training \ntechniques for deep learning models so \nlike different kinds of regularization \nstrategies like particular kinds of \nDropout or say particular kinds of like \nnormalization layers like ghost batch \nnormalization these kind of Innovations \nlike the owl by attention all this stuff \nhas been packaged in the composer \nlibrary and now LM Foundry looks like \nanother library of open sourcing all \nthese details it's like huge detail to \nlove about mosaic \nbut um so this mfu metric uh model flops \nutilization so you know like how much of \nthe hardware is the model utilizing when \nit's trading and I think you know again \nI'm not an expert on this myself but \nthere's all sorts of stuff behind um you \nknow like how they try to reduce idle \nGPU time with how they batch the data \nand they describe like this fully \nsharded data parallel thing and all \nsorts of interesting details of trying \nto you know make the most of all the \nresources for training these models so \nall sorts of things without diverging uh \nfrom Lost spikes lost spikes another \nthing you know as you're doing the \ngradient descent and these kind of this \nis kind of training techniques that come \ninto that composer Library I think to \ntry to you know control the training of \ngrading descent language models massive \nscale that kind of stuff so cool so MPT \n30 billion base the commercial Apache \n2.0 license that's a really interesting \ndetails competitive with other open \nsource models such as logo 30 billion or \nFalcon 40 billion they have this \ninteresting chart moving into in a \nsecond so \nokay so I think I don't think any of \nthese details quickly uh so train of the \nlong context window of 8K tokens versus \n2000 for llama and Falcon uh can handle \narbitrarily long context Windows via \nAlibi or with fine tuning so again this \nL by train short test along so they can \nextend the context window after training \nthe model they don't need to uh train \nthem with the sixteen thousand thirty \ntwo thousand two then extend it so I \nthink that's pretty interesting detail \num okay so to build 8000 support into \nMBT 30 billion we first pre-trained on \none trillion tokens using sequences that \nwere 2 000 tokens long and continued \ntrading for an additional 50 billion \ntokens using sequences that were 8 000 \ntokens long so interesting detail first \nI think you know heating up the pot with \na trillion tokens of 2000 token sequence \nlengths and then find like continuing \nthe pre-training still like Mighty much \nmodeling predicting the next token but \n50 billion tokens on the 8 000 token \nlike so just you know details about how \nthis kind of thing is you know happening \nwith the longer context Windows okay so \nhere's a super interesting table Mosaic \nml MPT 30 billion training data so you \nhave the C4 Corpus I think this is like \nthe you know the Colossal common crawl \nCorpus where you you know hit the \ninternet and get all sorts of data out \nof it uh red pajama I've heard that \nphrase but I'm not an expert on these \nkind of things but you know Wikipedia I \nhave to imagine the stack maybe is \num overflow semantic scholar so I'm not \nexactly sure oh stack exchange that \nthat's probably stack over full like \nthing and so books archived so you can \nsee basically the number of tokens that \nthese um that these data sources make up \nso Wikipedia it looks like it's only \nfive billion tokens relative to this uh \nyou know C4 which is 2.4 trillion these \nkind of details are so interesting I \nthink um \nhis paper called duromine something like \nthat where it's about um optimizing the \ncomposition of data sources in \npre-training so as a reminder this is \nused to pre-train the language model so \nthis is where it's predicting the the \nnext massed out token not where you're \ndoing that uh instruction tuning where \nyou have it write a big long thing and \nthen you say you know how was that and \nthen you fine tune it that way this is \njust like building that base language \nunderstanding from pre-training on \npredicting the index token on the \ninternet text basically uh cool so um so \nyou see this bar chart that shows the \nsize you see Wikipedia not as much as \nthe C4 and then you can see this is a \nreally interesting detail as well the \nsequence length distribution so uh you \nknow where where it's greater than four \nthousand ninety six tokens compared to \nuh the Baseline and the Baseline is I \nthink this 2000 context window so maybe \ninteresting like how the context is \nisolated I'm not an expert on this \ndetail as well but say the um you know \nWikipedia passage I imagine is only 3 \ntokens long like um you know somewhat I \ndon't know this is like randomly like \nsome small City or something that made \nit to Wikipedia but isn't like an 8 000 \ntoken sequence so maybe that's what \nthey're showing with this pot I'm not \nexactly sure okay so continuing on here \nis my favorite part of the blog post \nthey show the evaluation of their model \nwith this kind of diagram and so funny \nenough I remember this from playing \nPokemon where your Pokemons would have \nuh like different dimensions in this one \nkind of game but anyway so this kind of \nchart I don't I don't remember exactly \nwhat this kind of chart is called that's \nwhy I reference the Pokemon thing but \nyou have the you know how well it \nperforms in symbolic problem solving \nprogramming World Knowledge language \nunderstanding reading comprehension and \nCommon Sense reasoning so you know 0.4 \n0.6 these this is all the um the single \nmetric for this particular aspect of \nlanguage understanding so you see like \nMPT 30 billion in red MPT 7 billion in \nBlackboard or purple shading so you see \nthat reading comprehension the new model \nis much better maybe say symbolic \nproblem solving pretty similarly and so \nit's such an interesting chart because \nthere are so many different dimensions \nto evaluating these language models is \nprobably one of the most interesting \ntopics because you're trying to like \nboil the ocean and something Zayn said \none time that really stuck with me but \nyou're trying to boil the ocean where \nyou're trying to lay again you're trying \nto language model you know all of these \ndata sources so \nin the end it's quite interesting to see \nlike which particular types of thing \nlike how well can it write code or how \nwell can it write an essay on The Great \nGatsby so this this kind of evaluation I \nthink is really cool so in addition to \nlet me zoom in on this a bit so in \naddition to the comparison of 7 billion \nversus 30 billion they also have um MPT \nversus Falcon 40 billion as well as \nllama 30 billion so they're probably \nother I'm not an expert on falcon or \nLlama Or x-ray like knowledgeable of it \nthat much honestly so like of what kind \nof licenses they have is another detail \npeople probably care a lot about like \nwhether it's commercially licensed or \nnot or you know like MPT 30 but they've \nopen sourced the weights and they also \nhave all this infrastructure behind \nfine-tuning it so I think it just that \nit performs similarly is interesting \nmaybe it's another bitter lesson scale \nis all you need kind of thing but so \nperforming about the same as Falcon and \nMom that's what I'm trying to get at and \nthen similarly with the 7 billion okay \nso the next Super interesting detail is \nthe Mosaic ml inference and training \nCloud so starting off with the most ml \ninference Cloud so I think it's so \ninteresting that Mosaic ml is you know \ngetting into an inference Cloud this \nmakes it a lot easier for us to \nintegrate it with weaviate and all sorts \nof cool things so firstly right off the \nbat four times cost savings for the 30 \nbillion instruct versus The openai \nDaVinci checkpoint also four times cost \nsavings for the uh seven billion \ninstruct versus the openai carry model \nso uh you know I don't want to get into \nit Mosaic ML and opening I have friends \nwith both of them at wevate but this is \nwhat they're showing you on the cost of \nthese two different models with the \ninference apis so they describe the you \nknow commitment to privacy and then \nhere's a super interesting thing is \ncustomizability so Mosaic ml's training \nCloud they've always been you know \nfocused on training and how you would \nhave a custom large language model for \nyour data and I you know I think it's \ngoing to be super interesting to see how \nthis plays out and how much people want \nthis it's you know it's very interesting \nfrom the perspective of like retrieval \naugmented generation where you just you \nknow retrieve with the search models \nVector database to have to you know gpt4 \nthat has no knowledge that has just this \nGeneral reasoning ability that just \nreasons over the retrieved context or \nwhether it makes sense to keep this is \nthe reasoning model to keep fine-tuning \nthe reader model large language model so \nthen it retrieves some information about \nsay we V8 and then this model has been \nyou know rlhft with you know responses \nabout we V8 and then does that lead to \nbetter answers is it worth the trouble \nsuper interesting questions and I'm \nreally interested to see how this shakes \nout but \nwith Mosaic ml's cloud and also just the \num you know the publishing of the model \nso this headline customized MPC 30 \nbillion with Mosaic ml training so let's \nconclude with uh the training costs \nbehind uh training these new models so \nthey describe with 512 a100 40 gigabytes \nthis takes 28 days and costs 871 \n000 \nso then with 512 h100s with 80 gigabytes \nthis takes 11.6 days and 714 000 so I \nthink this is still you know quite a \nbreakthrough from how much the original \ngbt3 cost to train I mean 512 h100s the \nreason it makes me laugh is because you \nknow it is just an absolutely enormous \ncomputer if you think about it and then \nyou know running it for 12 days doing \nall this I mean and it's it's just \nremarkable what it's able to do just \nthis whole state of this technology is \nreally remarkable but \nin a mosaic ml they've been really good \nat getting these costs down so it'll be \nreally interesting to see how this you \nknow further plays out \num so they also describe uh the cost of \nfine-tuning on one billion tokens with \nMosaic ml so I think this is really \ninteresting so if you want to have a 16 \nh100 80 gigabyte cluster to fine-tune on \none billion tokens it'll take nine hours \nand only costs 714 dollars so you know \nthat's pretty reasonable to pay for \nsomething like that and all of it is \nmanaged on the Mosaic ml Cloud so you \nknow they're being super open about \ngiving you all these details behind how \nit all works open sourcing the LM \nFoundry Library composer writing blog \nposts like this that explain everything \nso the whole thing is just extremely \ninteresting if you wanted to you know \none billion tokens I think is quite a \nlot so if you were to start annotating a \ndata set of instruction tuning responses \nyou know you have this MPT 30 billion \nmodel it's been open source so you can \nstart generating some responses from \nthat labeling which ones you like which \nones you don't and then only 714 dollars \nto you know see how well that improves \nthe model or not so super interesting \ndetail uh they describe um you know \nsigning up for the demo with the uh the \ninference API and again it's our hug and \nface spaces so thank you so much for \nwatching this video on Mosaic ml's MPT \n30 billion Models Super exciting \ndevelopment for large language models \nand open sourcing them with commercially \nlicenses all the
