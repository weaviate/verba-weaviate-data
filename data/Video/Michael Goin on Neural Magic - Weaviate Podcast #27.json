{"text": "Thank you so much for watching the 27th episode of the Weaviate Podcast! This is truly one of my favorite podcasts we have ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nchecking out the wevia podcast I'm super \nexcited about this episode we have \nMichael going from neural magic uh \nneuromagic is such an exciting \ntechnology we've plugged it into Wii V8 \nto see how you can do this uh make \nfaster predictions with your models so \nthey call this inference acceleration \nthis General space of trying to make \nmachine learning models make predictions \nfaster they use all this amazing \ntechnology around sparsity and \nquantization it's just such an exciting \ntechnology overall and I'm so excited to \nwelcome Michael to the podcast \nyeah thanks for the warm welcome Connor \nI'm super excited about what we're \nenabling here together \num particularly at in Vector search and \npartnering with we V8 um yeah we're \npretty new to the space \num in general we have a lot of \nexperience in uh computer vision and \nnatural language processing \num in terms of you know question \nanswering classification your usual sort \nof NLP but \num yeah the whole Space of vector search \ninformation retrieval things like this \nare really exciting to us and seems to \nbe a lot of space for optimizing the \nfuture of databases \nyeah and it's so incredible to just you \nknow change out the text vectorizer and \npoint it to one of these sparse Zoo \nmodels and just see how fast it can turn \ntext into vectors turn images into \nvectors and then also these other \nUpstream things like as you mentioned \nquestion answering text classification \nuh so could we kick this off by \ndescribing uh what is neuromagic like \nhow is this faster model prediction \nachieved yeah so maybe if I just give a \nbit of a background on just where where \nwe're coming from uh and in our \ntechnology so at neural magic we're \nbuilding what we consider to be the \nsoftware uh or really the foundation for \nsoftware delivered AI \num and this is because as machine \nlearning models grow larger and larger \nand particularly in the last couple of \nyears with Transformers and large \nlanguage models we start like doubling \nthe numbers of parameters every uh even \nmultiple times a year from like four to \neight months is just the usual Cadence \nnow of talking about doubling up \nparameters and so this like massive \ngrowth in model parameter size means \nthat we've had to use specialized \nHardware accelerators in order to keep \nup with these state-of-the-art results \nhowever using these specialized Hardware \naccelerators can be incredibly difficult \nfor organizations to manage because \nreally if you want to optimize these \nmodels and get the best price \nperformance you can out of them it can \nquickly become a big challenge to \ndetermine which models you can run on on \nwhich hardware and how to optimize each \nmodel for that hardware and this is the \nexact opposite of most application \ninfrastructures and where we've already \ngotten really good at managing cpu-based \ninfrastructure that you can simply \nelastically scale what virtual Hardware \nyou have based on the actual application \ndemands \nuh I mean you know can you imagine if \nevery time you wanted to build uh like a \nmobile app or a website you had to wait \nfor your application server module or an \nextra thing you need to plug into your \ndata center or get uh get access to from \nyour cloud provider there's a reason \nthis doesn't happen anymore \num and the industry always evolves into \nsimple open commodity hardware and \nsoftware and so that's what we're \nbringing here with neural magic we're \nproviding the open software piece and \nenabling all this commodity Hardware you \nalready have available such as your CPUs \num to to start thinking about AI \ninference for those platforms \num so really excited about that and \nthrough that we're uh you know we do the \nusual sort of inference acceleration \nthings of oh you want to quantize your \nmodels bring them to lower precisions \nand get that extra memory and speed \nbenefit but we also focus on \nsparsification so this is a process \nwhere we're pruning away individual \nweights of the model while keeping its \noverall structure but think of it as \njust another compression algorithm you \nhave all these zeros and your weights \nnow and you can just simply choose to \nnot represent them and not calculate \nthem so this results in a memory and \nspeed savings now the research for \nsparsification has been around for \nseveral decades \num people have been specifying the \nmodels mostly for size uh you know \ncompression \nbenefits but in terms of seeing actual \ninference feed from it \num particularly on the hardware side \njust hasn't fully been explored and so \nwe focus on making smarter algorithms \nand heuristics for executing these \nsparse models in a sparse native way \nrather than just throwing you know dense \nmatrix multiplication at the problem and \nkind of brute forcing these models like \ntraditional Hardware accelerators do \num \nyeah yeah that's incredible and I think \nthere's a lot in there to unpack I I \nlove this argument around say the the \nCPU the the commodity computers and how \nyou know having the gpus is this \nbottleneck compared to how you package \nsoftware applications uh hearing about \nthe pruning and getting into the size \nnow we're definitely going to uh unpack \nthat a little more as well but like we \nalso hit a little more about this um \njust kind of like these numbers and some \nof these claims that like I came across \nneural magic I saw these uh images where \nit's like Burt large uh distillber and \nthis large run is a sparse large running \njust as fast as the Silver and now that \nI've plugged this into wavy and I've \nseen it myself firsthand and so can you \ntell me about just like these numbers \nthat you've all been able to produce \nbecause I think these just jump out to \npeople when you're scrolling through \nLinkedin and you see one of these bar \ncharts it's like five seconds on CPU six \nseconds on a 100 and say 13 seconds on \nT4 \nyeah so uh yeah great pulling out all \nthe results there's a there's a lot to \ngo through we're coming up with new \nresults every day \num but I especially find that first \nexample you brought up really \ninteresting of uh and this was actually \nuh research that we did in collaboration \nwith an Intel research lab so Intel \nthemselves are interested in sparsity \neven if they don't have uh you know uh \ninference acceleration for it there's \nstill interested in the research it's \nanother form of compression alongside \nquantization and so actually Intel \nresearch Labs over in uh uh their Israel \nbase \num \nuh have been working on greater various \nVarsity uh achieving greater and greater \nsparsities and uh you know contacted us \nfor using our engine as a as a sort of \nruntime for these models they're \nproducing and they published this paper \ncalled uh prune once for all \num and so it's basically this idea that \num uh you know what we call sparse \ntransfer learning \num but the essential idea that you can \nactually prune your pre-trained Upstream \nmodel so just like you would take a burp \nBass from hugging face that's been \npre-trained on Wikipedia or some large \nText corpus and a sort of unsupervised \nfashion \nthen you take this pre-trained model and \nfine tune it for your specific task on a \nmuch smaller set of data \num so what we found out with them is \nthat you can actually sparsify these \nmodels in the pre-training stage so now \nyou have a sparse architecture \num that's pre-trained and you can just \nmaintain the sparse architecture we \nfound of it and fine-tune it onto all \nyour data sets and results that they've \npublished and results that we publish \nfrom our research lab as well is that \nthe sparse transferring generalizes \nquite well across a variety of data sets \nand sparseity can actually help the \ngeneralization of models which is really \ninteresting to think about \num in that maybe your first intuition \nisn't that but the intuition we've kind \nof come across is not having you know \nthose millions and hundreds of millions \nextra parameters means that the model \nhas to make each parameter count a lot \nmore and take a sparser more General uh \nuh um a representation in order to \nmaintain the accuracy of the whole model \nso it's really interesting this Dynamic \nplay of \num you know maybe starting with dense \nmodels that work with too many \nparameters that work really well with \nour Stark very stochastic methods of \ntraining where we throw more data at it \nbut then getting to a good base accuracy \nand then working on sparse architect \nfinding sparse architectures to you know \ngo through the step of optimization \nbefore we just consider \nuh deploying these these dense models \num so yeah in in the case you brought up \nyeah we were able to get a large model \num to 80 sparsity with quantization and \nget its speed to the same level of a \ndistilbert model which has I think uh \neight times less parameters \num or maybe even 10 times less \nparameters \num and uh at maintaining essentially the \nsame accuracy of the original Bert large \nmodel so staying within we usually \nTarget 99 of the dense models accuracy \nas a as a as a place for sparsity to \nkeep us \num and yeah getting that 8X Improvement \non Bert large to uh keep its accuracy \nmuch higher than distilbert but get to \nthat same latency \num so yeah really opening up what size \nmodels we can or what accuracy models we \ncan really consider for deployments \nnowadays \nyeah and I I want to like firstly \ncongratulate you all on having this like \nscience and product it's so interesting \nthe The Bert surgeon this uh uh prune \nonce for all from getting the name right \nit's so cool seeing the science and the \nproduct together and and uh so so I \nreally want to get into uh so the sparse \nzoo and how these models come to be the \ndifference \num starting from the sparse transfer \nlearning I find that to be absolutely \nsuper interesting the way that say you \nsparsify a language model and then you \nknow what we do in Vector search a lot \nis we train with contrastive learning we \nhave maybe uh triplet losses or we have \nthis uh multiple negatives ranking loss \nso we you know we can take a sparse \nmodel and then fine tune it with our \nkind of contrastive learning objectives \nto produce vectors yeah so what is the \nstate of the Sparks Zoo how do we you \nknow sparse transfer learn get new \nsparse models on the zoo what does that \nall look like \nyeah so great question so sparse zoo is \na website you can go to smartstood.com \nand you can check out um the 100 or so \nmodels that um we host both their their \ndense sort of baselines and then all of \nthe sparse and sparse quantized models \nwe produce since there \num uh you know for a variety of tasks \nacross computer vision and NLP \num so definitely encourage you to check \nthat out \num but yeah within there this is where \nwe have these sparse Upstream models \num or even these sparse Downstream \nmodels \num that are that have been produced by \nour research our ml researchers and \nengineers and the key thing is that \neverything we push up there is \nreproducible we have commands ready for \nyou to make them with the rest of and we \nuse this concept of recipes \nwhich were really just yaml files but \ncontrolling all the hyper parameters and \npruning modifiers quantization modifiers \nbasically laying out a whole schedule of \ntraining for this model or optimization \ndepending on where you're starting \num and and that all folds into our open \nsource machine learning library called \nsparse ml that plugs into and builds on \ntop of common Frameworks like pytorch \nultralytics pug and face Transformers \nthings like this so uh you know both \nwith like uh you know in the in the hug \nand face Transformers case you know we \nhave our own trainer class that we've \ninherited from the Transformers class \nand added sparsification to it and so \nyou should you know you once you pip \ninstall sparse ml you can build your ml \napplication with this trainer exactly in \ncode or we have CLI commands like \nsparsaml.transformers dot question \nanswering for example and you can just \npoint it to a model you want to train \nreference the recipe in spark Zoo to \nfollow the same path we've gone choose \nyour data set choose your hyper \nparameters use essentially like you \nwould any Transformers call \nand and we really hope that helps people \nreproduce their results and put bring \nthem onto their own custom data sets \nit's all open source so you can \ncontribute your own custom pipelines \num and and maybe training losses things \nlike this \num and so yeah uh sort of all scattered \nacross readme's and documentation and on \nsparsu itself there's uh commands and \nguides for each of the models that we \nthat is part of the process of uploading \na model you need to \num have the sparse ml commands for \ntraining it evaluating it validating the \naccuracy and the Deep sparse commands \nfor uh validating the speed that we \nmeasured as well or you know \nacceleration \num so so yeah that's kind of an overview \nat of our ml side and then of course on \nthe inference side we have the Deep \nsparse engine \num which is free to use uh for personal \nand and research \num so we're really excited about what \npeople have been building with that \num you know in our slack communities and \non GitHub issues um people using it for \nvarieties and models we haven't even uh \ndecided to sparsify ourselves yet \nthey've found success in medical imaging \nsuper resolution \num even uh you know subclasses of \npopular NLP \num tasks that we haven't gone for yet \nlike multi-label \num \nuh classification \nyeah super interesting and I I \ndefinitely want to get into \num benchmarking as we've talked about \nhow we you know clock these things in \nthe difference between say 128 sequence \nlengths or 384 sequence lengths and I \nwant to get into that but um on this \ntopic of recipes and the sparse ml \ntrainer I first kind of became familiar \nwith this kind of recipe thinking of \nwhat goes into a trainer when I was \nlearning about Mosaic ML and their \ncomposer and they have all these \ndifferent regularizers that you you know \npackage into a recipe to train your \nmodel with like so I know a little bit \nabout pruning you zero out some weights \nI know there's like iterative pruning \nmaybe second order pruning is also \nsomething you do is what is the recipe \nfor the esparzano \nyeah so \num yeah recipes in sparse smell can can \nhold a lot of information it it you \ndon't have to use them for pruning or \noptimization in general they have very \nsimple building blocks with them simple \nthings like learning rate modifiers \num so how you want to modulate your \nlearning rate over time or introduce \num ways to boost accuracy like \ndistillation from teacher models or a \ndense upstream or even dense Downstream \nmodels \num these are all things that help \nimprove the accuracy improve the \nrobustness of training your model \num and so so yeah really a recipe is \njust uh that the base thing to it is you \ndefine a start Epoch and a end Epoch and \nthen you list out all of the the \nmodifiers all these little \num uh modules essentially you want to \nhook into your training pipeline \num over or you know over the training \ntime of the model \num so yeah and we focus a lot on Pi \ntorch we have some Integrations with \nKeras and tensorflow as well \num but yeah it's totally mentioned that \nyou know you can make a sparse smell uh \nmanager essentially and just hook this \nin as a callback function into your \ntraining framework of choice and and it \ncan start um you know overriding things \nlike your learning rate \num uh all sorts of things like this \nother Integrations as well as uploading \nyour experiments uh automatically to \nweights and biases and and comment uh \num tensorboard \ncommon uh common ways to for ML Ops to \nview the status of your experiments and \nuh you know early stop them uh continue \nthem back up from checkpoints \num things like this you know made made \nfor the ml practitioners but also all \nwrapped up and \ncommand line scripts so that \num uh you know data scientists and data \nhackers can also get started on just \ntrying a new data set trying a new \nexperiment they have in mind \nsuper interesting and I yeah the whole \nthe way that this enables sparse models \nand getting away from needing these \ncrazy expensive dense models and towards \nthis more exploiting the inherent \nsparsity of neural networks to make this \nmore economical run on CPUs Etc about \ncontinuing in sort of the Practical \nstack so now we have our sparse model \nand we want to evaluate it and say how \nmuch faster it is the things like say \nmoving the data to the GPU or all these \nthings what goes into benchmarking these \ninference accelerations and saying this \nis faster than pytorch be you know \nyeah yeah great question it's and it's \nreally difficult to it's unfortunately \npretty difficult to Benchmark across all \nthese different types of hardware and \nFrameworks they all want to do it in \ndifferent ways but we try to abstract \nthis away as much as possible especially \non since most of our models are based in \npi torch back ends \num we we put a lot of this work into \nsparse ml you know in addition to the \nvalidation process also measuring how \nfast are we validating the results you \nknow what what's our iterations per \nsecond things like this and so this \nallows us to measure at least you know \nsome CPU and GPU results on Pi torch and \nmeasure that but \num you know most of our benchmarks are \ncomparing \num CPU how much faster can we make CPUs \nand so from that perspective we like to \nrun and compare against other uh engines \nthat were built for inference such as \nOnyx runtime or openvino \num that uh and and that's part of our \nprocess of actually getting to inference \ntime so once you you've trained a model \nor taken a model from sparse or sparse \nml \nin in your framework of choice we \nusually export that model into an open \nuh model format called Onyx and this is \njust a graph representation where each \nnode in the graph it's a different \noperations such as convolution matrix \nmultiplication relu pooling things like \nthis so maybe just your one multi-head \nattention block or Transformers is \nbroken into 20 different nodes that are \nall connected \nuh but the key thing this is a an open \nformat you know uh uh spearheaded by \nMicrosoft Facebook Google \num so all the Frameworks can export into \nthis and and can even uh take Onyx in as \na as a a as an input uh back in and so \nthat's the main thing that the Deep \nsparse engine takes and uh usually once \nwe get this Onyx then we can bring this \nin to all of the other inference engines \nas well and start to measure their \nperformance \num and so yeah getting into the details \nof performance and and what are the \ndifferent benchmarks that can really \ncover accurately the the realistic \nscenarios that you're going to use once \nyou once you deploy models there's \nthere's a couple major ones so \num the first sort of obvious one is when \nyou have just a single image or a single \nyou know query coming into the model you \nwant to run this as fast as possible and \nyou want to get that result back to feed \ninto your pipeline and we call this a \nsynchronous or a latency based scenario \nso we're talking about batch size one \nand you know a single image a single \nsentence or set of tokens \num representing one request \nand our goal there is to see how fast \ncan the whole system or section of the \nsystem uh uh return this result back to \nyou so this is really common and a part \nwhere actually gpus uh or Hardware \naccelerators in general struggle a lot \nas they usually can't access the memory \non the CPU which is where this result \nusually starts from in terms of you know \nyou are are getting a an HTTP request \nsomeone's giving you an image and asking \nfor a result that networking request \nlands on the cpu's memory and then now \nif you want to run it on a GPU you need \nto pass that image over pcie express \nonto the GPU copying onto its memory it \nthen executes on that then you need to \ncopy the result back over PCI Express \nback onto the CPU memory it can put \ntogether the network response and then \nsend that back out so when you're really \ntalking about a handful of milliseconds \nper request and you you don't want the \nml model to be the bottleneck in your \napplication pipeline \nthis is where latency is a really \nimportant scenario to look deeply into \num so that's that's a basic one we do \nthere's also a throughput or batched \nscenarios where say you're working on an \noffline task say you have you know a \nmillion things you want to embed before \nthe end of the night the question is \njust how quick or how cost effective can \nyou can you run through this and so here \nyou find a good batch size that can fit \nwithin your memory available or utilizes \nthe system well and then you distribute \nall these batches across your available \nHardware as fast as possible and so this \nallows you to amortize some of the \ncommunication costs you still have a lot \nof data to move around but it should be \na place where you're really Bound by \num \ncompute as long as everything fits into \nmemory \nand so this is pretty good for offline \ntasks and then another example that we \nhear a lot about from our partners and \nwhat they're interested is \num is sort of a model server or a \nmulti-stream asynchronous case \nand so think of it just like a web \nserver uh and and we uh make it very \neasy to start up model servers so just \nthink of we're presenting a model to the \nworld \num as a restful endpoint we commonly use \nfast apis this is just a super easy to \nuse thing that you can just ping its doc \nendpoint get information about what \nformat your your image or tensor needs \nto be in send it over and you you also \nhave a schema to tell you how to use the \noutput \nand so in this case you know you're \nserving multiple users at a time like \nyou would at a web server and each \nrequest that is coming into your server \nyou need to dispatch this efficiently \nacross your Hardware you don't want each \nof these responses running into each \nother and causing each other to slow \ndown and you know the goal is to serve \nas many users as possible and many \nrequests as possible while hitting you \nknow the latency requirement that you \nhave for your application and your users \num so this is something we spend a lot \nof time on as this is where a lot of \napplication deployments end up in terms \nof you know either it's it's sort of \nlatency or offline in terms of making \nvery small you know vcpu or Cloud \ninstances so this works well if you're \ngoing in say a kubernetes cluster and \nyou you know maybe like each node is \nworking on a single inference but often \nit can be a lot more cost efficient to \njust have a single larger node that this \nmodel server is hosting up a model or \neven multiple models on one node \nand uh just depending on the request \ncoming in dispatching those models and \nthere's requests across this single \nsystem \num which can really help drive down cost \nand also make your application \ncomplexity \num or you're really really your uh your \nml infrastructure much simpler so \nhope that was helpful those are sort of \nthe major three scenarios \nyeah it's incredible the uh the node \nserver and how you can have each node \ngoing in so I have my question to kind \nof build my understanding of this and \nI'm sorry to listeners if this is a dumb \nquestion but it is it like you would \nwant to do one by one inferences on the \nCPUs compared to where the GPU I think \nwhat you you batch it up into say like \n64 predictions at a time because it's \nthis big GPU so you like you know take a \nlot of data at once is it with the CPU \nthinking say you have like 16 cores is \nit like inference inference inference \nlike like a multi-threaded programming \nway of thinking about inference \num yeah definitely in the multi-stream \ncase it can be really it can be usually \npretty efficient to uh you know have \nthese like multiple streams where each \none of these like batch size one \ninferences are pinned to individual \ncores \num to really help so it's kind of like \nan embarrassingly parallel problem each \ncore is working on different problems \num \nbut you know in terms of uh getting the \nbest possible performance this is where \nit's really in your best interest to use \nan inference engine that's designed for \nCPUs like deep sparse where we're aware \nof especially the the unique topology \nthat Hardware topology that CPUs have in \nterms of having multiple levels of cash \nlayer one layer two layer three Cash \nsometimes even a layer four cache and \nyour main memory of course and uh \nparticularly with these sparse uh \nquantized models you can for instance on \nthese large models we've produced \nyou know uncompressed as a dense fp32 \nmodel they're commonly at one or 1.2 \ngigabytes on disk and even more in \nmemory and once we've sparsified these \nuh large models we've been able to lower \nthem by \num at least an order of magnitude \ngetting them down under 100 megabytes \nfor instance once sparse quantized and \nso \num this now uh is really interesting as \nlike oh maybe your L3 cache on the CPU \nis 70 megabytes so maybe we can fit you \nknow half of the network just in the L3 \ncache of this section of cores and so \nlet's just have this section of course \nwith this L3 cache just running this \nmodel and so all inferences are going to \ngo through this section of cores now we \ndon't require you to have to have this \nsophisticated understanding of the \nhardware you're running on but these are \nsome of the optimizations we think about \nwhen you're building your application \nwith our we with our engine and our \nespecially our model server that can \nintelligently make these decisions based \non the hardware available and and the \nmodels you provided as well compiling \nthe model down to fit the hardware \navailable so it's a really interesting \noptimization problem and we have a lot \nof systems and math Engineers that work \nhere who find that problem interesting \nas well \num but uh \nbut yeah generally you know CPUs can see \na benefit from throughput as well it's \nnot that it's just completely lost on \nthem you you get more throughput and \ngenerally the scaling is better as you \nbecome more compute bound obviously \nbecause we're removing you know 90 of \nthe compute from the model when we prune \nit to 90 percent uh \nso it really is about efficiently using \nall subsystems of the hardware from the \ncompute you have available to the memory \nto the networking \num and and even the the larger ml \npipeline around the model \num you know we we offer this \num uh you know similar to Transformers \nthis idea of pipelines that um will wrap \nthe model around pre-processing and \npost-processing that's needed \num both for ease of use but also with \ngood defaults for Speed so \num you can just host up a whole pipeline \ninstead of hosting a model and you can \njust feed that straight text instead of \nneeding which tokenizer do I need in \norder to tokenize the words into the \nembeddings and then provide these tokens \nto the model \num so that you can just send your text \nand get your sentiment out of the model \num directly without needing to know all \nthe nitty-gritty of ml pipelines and how \nto do it in the right way efficient for \nthe hardware \nso so it is is really about bottlenecks \nat every single layer both inside and \noutside of the model \nyeah those abstractions of pipelines are \nso useful like from sentence Transformer \nimport sentence Transformer and model \nDot and code and then just the string \nand then you've got the vector and that \nabstraction having that similar thing um \nI really want to ask about from the \nbeginning uh the CPU cache hierarchy and \nsort of generally the CPU what what it \noffers but uh quickly \num so to access is you know running it \nfrom pip install deep sparse from Deep \nsparse import pipeline is and then is \nthat the best way or is there say like a \nDocker container uh that would put this \ninference engine I don't know these \nthings too well but like what's the \ndifference between you know running in \nand python or say is there like some \ncontainer I think the question to ask \nyeah yeah yeah no it yeah totally \nunderstood \num yeah I mean I think definitely for \ndevelopers that like to get their hands \nNitty Gritty \num understand the the ux of the the code \nitself and uh understand the code behind \nour benchmarks as well \num you know it's in your best interest \nyeah pip install it run it locally use \nthe pipelines use the models without the \npipelines \num and and and read all the code that's \non the Deep Source GitHub \num now yeah for people that are more \nthinking about how can the scale \num in my infrastructure \num particularly things like kubernetes \nyeah we we offer \num Docker containers you know most \ncommonly \num yeah we have this deep sparse server \nthat is that the docker containers \nusually built around and then it's just \nthe case of what config file do you give \nthat Docker container and the config \nfile \num just defines yeah what model do we \nwant to use what's the pipeline that \nit's using uh you know what IP address \nand port or what port should I host it \non simple things like this how many \nstreams should I work on how many cores \nshould I use uh this is all sort of in a \ntext file that you can provide \num but yeah we actually have some \nexamples uh up to date on uh sagemaker \nand we're working on ones for AWS Lambda \nand Cloud run to to show you examples uh \nor even on just you know local \nkubernetes examples I think we're doing \nthe mini Cube as well \num to scale across eks or gks so that \nyeah you can you can just treat your \ndocument container as another \num \nyeah web application that uh you know \nyou have this uh restful API into \num and so it's just the case of how many \npods do I put this Docker container on \nput a load balancer over it and build \nyour application without worrying about \num uh without worrying about scale it's \njust managed for you \num and I think that's really interesting \nuh just in the case that you know we are \nrunning on CPUs we can run on vcpus at \nthe smallest level because we're just \nlooking at what instructions are \navailable you don't need to set up any \nfancy drivers \num like Cuda or special environments \num it's really just running on Linux \nlooking at the CPU information \nand uh you know able to scale down all \nthe way down to a a task uh or a pod on \na kubernetes cluster all the way up to \nyou know uh uh bare metal multi-socket \nservers that are you know uh uh uh \nhosting 20 models at a time \nyeah super exciting I think the like \nright now the way I've plugged in neural \nmagic to aviate is through our text to \nVEC Transformers container you just \nreplaced the docker image with one that \nhas the neuromagic pipeline and uh yeah \nit's exciting because I think there's \nstill even more optimizations we can do \nto get this like even faster and so so \nkind of the next topic I think we've \nkind of really covered the um the like \nhow to use it the practical application \nand uh so I was listening to uh near \nshavid on Jana kilcher's podcast taco \nand it seems like a whole reinvention of \nthe model architecture like things like \nsay you can access a terabyte of memory \nand then the human brain is sparse I can \ntell me about like this kind of vision \nof like like sparsity is it is it more \nthan just like layer by layer one quote \nfrom the podcast that stood out to me is \nsomething around thinking yeah like \ngenerally like this thinking of like \nlayer one layer two layer three that \nthere's some other way maybe it's like a \npath that doesn't wait for this one to \nfinish other ways of traversing this \ngraph do you think about this kind of \nthing \nyeah yeah I mean we think about this \nthing internally \num obviously you know from our \nbackground uh you know from MIT you know \nco-founders near shuvit professor at MIT \nreally accredited wonderful individual \num and and his post-doc uh Alex uh Mata \nmatiev \num that uh that they co-founded this \ncompany together you know they were \nworking in the in a connectomics lab \ntogether and uh working with brain \nresearchers as the computer science \npeople to help them and yeah they sort \nof from the problem they were working on \nthey were trying to image and or pattern \nout brains and these are obviously \nsparse architectures so they came up \nwith sparse algorithms to map onto the \nbrain and so \num yeah totally you know the the road \nwe're going down in terms of uh or the \nroad we are down uh in terms of training \nmodels and deploying them very much \nworks on the idea of having dense layers \nfeeding into dense layers larger and \nlarger models \num that are at fully connected layers \num and like I said this works well \nbecause we found a golden bullet that \nworks for now stochastic gradient \ndescent you just throw more data at it \nyou regularize it enough you showed \nenough data at a time and and it can \njust continue and continue to keep \nlearning \num but that doesn't mean that it is the \nbest way \num uh and I think like in the future \num you know this the scaling especially \nas Moore's Law \num you know struggles to continue \nforward \num we need to find more efficient ways \nof training and running these models \num and and this is what we hear exactly \nfrom our customer engagements they a lot \nof times they have models running in \nproduction or they're gearing up and \nthen they're getting some load and \nthey're realizing yeah this doesn't make \nsense uh but the value is there for \ntheir uh for the people using it it's \njust too expensive operationally to run \nall these models \num and that's because most the time \nthey're just training the model on the \nGPU and then they're like well it's \naccurate uh how do we run it and then \nthey go run it on the same GPU that they \nthat they trained on \num and you know haven't taken the \nthought of from training to inference \nlet's have a step of optimization in \nthere and that's really what we're what \nwe're um working on now introducing that \noptimization step to more and more \npeople \num now of course like you probably \nshouldn't be training dense models in \nthe first place but \num it'll take a lot of research and \nprogress in science to get there \num but I'm sure we we can get there \num you know purely from the idea yeah \nthe brain is a is equivalent to a cell \nphone of compute with a petaflop of \nmemory \num it's it's not the other way around \nwhere you know we we don't have exit \nflops of compute in our brains \num with it with a you know yeah \ncertainly we don't have teraflops of \ncompute with just you know 16 gigabytes \nof memory attached \num we we have a lot more memory \num and and access it really efficiently \nso that uh we don't need to eat all the \ntime \num so so yeah that that's that's \ndefinitely how we think about it \num but also you know just in case of \ntalking about this asynchronous \nexecution \num that that we've built in our engine \nas uh deep tensor columns \num it's not like we're only like we're \nthe only ones working on this \num you know a great example actually is \nthe uh the really famous Google paper \num from I think about a year ago \nPathways \num or even their sparse Transformers \npaper before that where they train you \nknow I think a trillion parameter model \neven larger than gpt3 \num but the key thing was based on the \ninput coming in you know you would have \nsay multiple uh multi-head attention or \nfully connected layers multiple \nessentially experts you could choose \nfrom and based on the input coming in it \nwould route it through a different \npipeline so you have you know 100 times \nmore parameters \nthan than you would actually use for \neach individual inference but you're \nsampling them over time for different \ninferences \num so this is obviously at a very \nstructural large scale \nbut uh it you know it makes sense this \nis what the brain does we're not \naccessing we're not running all of the \nweight setting parameters and neurons \nand synapses in our brain every second \nit's localized at certain pieces that we \nneed to run every single millisecond or \npieces that we need to run we need to \nremember a nice memory or something like \nthat \nso so yeah it's it's really interesting \nyeah that's super interesting I guess I \nwas thinking of that yeah those two \nangles where one it's like you're \nrealizing the lottery ticket hypothesis \nwhere you know you theoretically can \ntrain this bar sub network from scratch \nand having this quantization aware \ntraining where you're pruning during \ntraining is like getting closer to that \nkind of idea where it's like be mindful \nof the sparsity during training and then \nlike this Pathways thing which is like a \ntotal rethink of how deep neural \nnetworks are gonna I'm sorry I'm gonna \nprocess data \nto make their predictions um so one \nother uh thing that I think is really \ninteresting is uh Edge applications like \npredictions at the edge putting it in \nphones or embedded sensors things like \nthis can you tell me about like your \nmotivation around Edge applications say \nlike maybe robotics or like apps that I \nguess don't have to network like what \nwhat's the thinking around Edge case \napplications of deep learning \nyeah so uh you know the most obvious \nthing is power you want to keep power on \nthese things as little as possible \num so it's obvious we want to make the \nmachines as efficient as possible \num while also maybe paying the least \namount to get them on there but \num in addition to that there's also the \ncost of of the networking uh of the \nbandwidth you pay \num and uh you know we've heard this a \nlot \num from from retail and Manufacturing \num in that uh you know they they don't \nwant to send uh you know 200 cameras \nfrom every store out to AWS they don't \nwant to pay the Ingress costs every day \num and it would be much better if they \ncould at least \num uh you know just send out the high \nlevel analytics every day instead of \ndoing to process all of that in a data \ncenter you know hundreds of miles away \nand also use that bandwidth of the store \nthat their their you know employees and \ncustomers would would like to have good \nWi-Fi at \num so it uh \nyeah it really is like a problem uh a \nproblem with more problems at every \nlevel \num but yeah I mean it's really from the \ncase like you know you think about \num a camera or say like a you know a \ncamera running uh at your front door at \nyour doorbell for uh you know to look at \nthe delivery driver or \num you have to essentially replace your \ndoorbell many people have these \num and they wouldn't really like every \nsingle thing being shipped out to \num uh to the people that make them \num and so each one of those cameras I \nbet you a hundred percent has a CPU \nattached to them \num maybe with some you know video \ndecoding stuff next to it but the CPU \nhas to be communicating that thing and \nso if we can make the models and things \num that are that are useful for this \ndata small enough and compressed enough \nbut still accurate enough to run on \nthese devices \num at the edge and then the camera \ndoesn't communicate with anything even \neven on your local Wi-Fi using that \nbandwidth \num uh even outside of external bandwidth \num unless there's a warning or something \nserious that should be looked at or \nevery once in a while \num that's just a better experience for \neveryone involved and and plus the the \nbox that you have \num plugged into your wallet integrated \ninto your Mainframe you don't need to \nhave the compute there have the power \nthere have it be noisy and uh \num and things there so definitely \nwe hear the asks every day um and that's \nwhy obviously a lot of people are \ninterested in what we have to do \num so yeah it's really just about \num \nfiguring out the whole pipeline Beyond \njust optimizing the model to make it \neasy to build these applications fit \nthem into smaller devices that's part of \nthe reason why you know the Deep Source \nengine we focused on x86 CPUs to start \nwith so made by Intel and AMD because \nthose especially were the most common \nfour years ago uh uh which we the \ncompany was founded at \nbut now arm is is running everywhere \nboth in the cloud on the edge on this \nMacBook I'm talking to you right now \nfrom \num so so we're working on arm support \nright now and hoping to have an alpha by \nthe end of this uh this year and \nhopefully a demo at neurops in December \nwhere we'll be presenting \num so uh so so yeah looking forward to \ngetting sparse networks onto more types \nof hardware \nyeah that's a super interesting example \nof the um the doorbell like I think it \ndetects the package deliveries \nand you might not necessarily want to \nhave a doorbell of your front door like \nstreaming to the cloud service all the \ntime and all this motivation around say \nlike Federated learning and that kind of \nthinking and I think it's interesting \ntoo with with we did if you want to have \nlike a vector-based approach to this \nwhere uh say it's a security camera and \nit's kind of like doing outlier \ndetection so it has the you know it \ntakes an image of the of the front of \nyour yard vectorizes it on the CPU with \nsomething like neuromagic and then it \nbuilds up this Vector index to do the \noutlier detection I think it's very \ninteresting and also say like this \nvision of like uh the Tesla bot like \nwhere you can have a household robot \nthat you get I think I think a lot other \nthan Tesla I think a lot of startups \nbelieve in this kind of thinking that \nwe're going to have like a five foot \neight uh robot that you say uh make me \nsome eggs and then it will go make eggs \nand similarly in that case I could \nimagine that you'd want it to not do \nthis kind of bandwidth uh sending and \nhave it be like yeah you don't want it \ntaking up a a person's worth of uh \nsomeone streaming Netflix on your Wi-Fi \nconstantly right \nhook it all up yeah \ncertainly so yeah we've heard that as \nwell \nyeah awesome well thank you so much \nMichael I you know I think the \ntechnology of neuromagic the way it fits \nwith weeviate is so exciting and you \nknow sparsity the visions of this the \nsparse Zoo sparse ml all of it is just \nso captivating and thank you so much for \nuh doing the weave podcast \nyeah thanks so much for having me and \nit's been great talking to you and and \nlearning from you over the time really \nexcited to uh yeah learn more about the \nuse cases for Vector search and uh \ncontribute some some cool demos \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Michael Goin on Neural Magic -
