{"text": "Tuana Celik, a Developer Advocate at Deepset, presented many exciting ideas around Question Answering! We began with her ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nchecking out another episode of the we \nvva podcast today i'm here with \ntuwanachilik a developer advocate at \ndeepset working on things like haystack \nand she's created an incredible hugging \nface spaces demo of a game of thrones \nquestion answering bot and i just really \nwanted to talk to her to understand this \nfurther understand deep said haystack \nand the things that they're working on \nso tawana thank you so much for joining \nthe we va podcast \nthank you very much for having me \nso to kind of kick things off could you \ntell me about the game of thrones uh \ndemonstration uh what went into it the \nmotivation kind of these kind of these \nkinds of things \nsure so the game of thrones \ndemo is really a demo to display an \nextractive qa pipeline that you can very \neasily set up with haystack \nso it's a very simple uh demo it uses in \nmemory document store and the whole idea \nis really to to to show people how you \ncan set something up super quickly and \nyeah i've uh hugging face space has been \naround for not really long but still \nquite a while um and i really wanted my \nto get my hands on it so \nthis is what i came up with \nso there are a few things i would unpack \nwith that but first could you tell me \nabout the the role of haystack in it the \nkind of the nodes and the pipelines and \nand what that looks like for this \nsure so i'll start off by talking a bit \nabout deep set so deep set is the \ncompany and we have a open source nlp \nframework and that is haystack \nand what haystack really is it's a \nopen source um and the whole idea is to \nbe able to quickly build an end-to-end \nyou know production-ready nlp \napplication so that could be question \nanswering that could be summarization \ntranslation a whole bunch of things \num and it comes on the it's based on the \nidea of nodes and pipelines so \nit gives you the flexibility to sort of \nuh switch and sort of construct your own \npipeline based on the task you want to \nachieve so for me in this scenario i had \nan in-memory document store and then i \nhad a retriever which would then based \non the query you know give the reader \nmodel or the question answering model \num \nthe most relevant documents and then a \nquestion answering model um but yeah so \nhaystack is based on this idea of being \nable to sort of um like lego blocks \nbuild something up from scratch based on \nwhat you want to do \nyeah that's super exciting and i love \nthat kind of retrieve then \nre-decomposition uh can you tell me a \nlittle bit more about the in-memory \ndocument store and how that might differ \nfrom other kind of uh \nsort of like back-end retrieval store \noptions that are available and i mean \nwith the plug-in with we've a we can \nimagine with having the yeah like a \nvector database is the back end can you \nmaybe explain for the difference between \nthe in-memory thing and other options so \nin-memory document is basically what it \nsays on the tin it's an in-memory \ndocument store so there's nothing fancy \ngoing on um and it was the easiest to \nset up just to get going with but you \ncan imagine a scenario where you have \nlots and lots of documents like like \nresiding somewhere whether that be we v8 \nor open search or elasticsearch any \nother document store and then based on \nwhat those are you can also have more \nflexibility to then work with maybe \nvector representations of text data and \nwhich is going to make \nfinding similar documents to the query \nyou ask a lot faster maybe so \num it's really about \nhow efficient you want your system to be \nand where your documents were in the \nfirst place \num so in this example i didn't want to \nbe bothered with connecting up anything \nelse so i just went with an in-memory \ndocument store um but yeah you can \nimagine a scenario where i think we \nalready even um we recorded a demo with \nlaura from semi technologies your \ncolleague actually where we use uh wev8 \num document store with embeddings so uh \nwith vector search um with a question \nanswering pipeline \nyes so i really want to get back into \nthe details of the question answering \npipelines and uh the different retrieval \nmodels the extractive question answering \nthese questions but really quickly could \nyou could you tell me about hugging face \nspaces and uh kind of when you first saw \nit did it like what kind of \ndid it capture attention right away like \nhow do you see this kind of hugging face \nspaces platform \nhugging face spaces is i i quite like it \ni really like it actually because it's a \nit's a really nice way to prototype and \ndemo \ndemo applications to people \num so i yeah i've i've quite enjoyed it \nactually there are two options right now \nas far as i know so you can build an \napplication with streamlet or gradio so \ni built this one with streamlit it was \nvery you know quite quick to get going \nwith to be honest um and yeah it's it's \na very nice way for you to be able to \nshow code to people where it's not just \npure code and they can already start \ninteracting with it and you know inspire \npeople to like this is what you can \nachieve in \nx many lines of code um so i'm i'm \nreally enjoying it uh and yeah so it's \nnice to show people prototypes of \ncertain very like \num \nisolated tasks so in this one we are \ndoing question answering hopefully and i \nalready have a pdf summarizer one which \ni'm not super happy with the performance \nof but it still can it's it's great to \nbe able to have an application giving \npeople the idea of what you could \nachieve yeah \nyeah i think the way that it lets you \nvisualize it and then have uh user \ninterface input output and yeah gradio \nstreamlin the way that they've \nsimplified creating a front end for \nmachine learning people i think is just \nsuper powerful and exciting and it also \nkind of has like a content platform \nflare to it where it has like the \nuh the news feed trending this week it \nkind of helps people discover other \napplications and maybe like integrate it \nwith science and publications and you \nyou know you please cite my work you \nlink to your paper with your demo and i \nthink overall it's creating like more \ncommunity more engagement with the deep \nlearning research crowd but so \ntransitioning from face spaces which i \nlove and i'm happy that we're both \nexcited about this and i you know i i'm \nreally excited about the future of \nhugging face bases uh can we dive deeper \ninto the question answering part of this \nand i know um deepset has a roberta \nquestion answering model that's on \nhugging face uh the model hub and it's \none of the most popular question \nanswering models i think out there \ncan you tell me more about the question \nanswering model that's used in the game \nof thrones demonstration and uh \ngenerally your thoughts on uh question \nanswering \nuh yes so we do have quite a few \nquestion answering models by deep set on \nhugging face actually so roberta bass \nsquad 2 is one of the \nmost popular question answering models \nbut we also have what we now call \ndistilled \nversions of these models which are way \nlighter \nhence a lot faster to work with as well \nand still perform \nrelatively um you know comparably good \nto the original the teacher model let's \nsay \nand yeah so these models are generally \nthey are \ntrained on squad data sets so question \nanswer pairs \num and the nice thing about this is \nwhere i feel like a lot of people don't \nrealize this is how \nwell pre-trained models can actually \ngeneralize to \nunseen domains so we often get the \nquestion \nuh with from people who want to sort of \nstart diving into question answering so \nhow long did it take for you to train \nyour data train your model on this let's \nsay they see the game of thrones one on \nthe game of thrones data set and the \nanswer to that is actually i didn't \ntrain a model at all i use a pre-trained \nmodel question answering model and these \nmodels are trained to \nlook search for answers which is why we \nrefer to question answering as a search \ntask they are trained to search for \nanswers \nin unseen data so that was how i was \nable to just take a pre-trained model \noff the shelf \nand use an in-memory document store put \nall my game of thrones documents there \nand basically told the model this is all \nthe documents i have \nthis is what the retriever says are the \nmost relevant to the question that was \nasked to me \num \nnow now look for the answer in these \ndocuments um so yeah \nyeah that's incredible the the ability \nof these pre-trained models to do \nsomething like that i i never would have \nguessed like i wouldn't have suspected \nthat a question answering model would be \nable to adapt to all the domains like \nthis but it looks like this retrieve \nthen read decomposition \nhas offered a flexibility that is really \nexciting and and so the retrieval model \nalso doesn't need to be fine-tuned right \nlike it's a sentence transformer trained \non like wikipedia and it's a hugging \nface model that part also doesn't need \nto be fine-tuned or specialized \nyeah i did not fine-tune the the \nsentence similarity model either \num i can imagine you know scenarios that \nmaybe you might um can't really think of \none off the top of your head because \nwhat the retriever model is really doing \nis or let's say what the retriever \ncomponent of the pipeline is doing is \nit's getting a question \nand it's saying okay i'm going to use a \nsentence similarity model to to decide \nwhich documents in the document store \nare the most relevant for the reader \nmodel to even bother looking through \nbecause the the challenge we have here \nand this is where you guys get in this \nis where vector and certain yeah vector \noptimized database is getting is that \nreader models at the end of the day they \nare limited by input \nso um imagine you're telling a reader \nmodel to list let's say go through \nhundreds of documents that's going to \ntake a lot of time for it to decide what \nthe most you know what the the best \nanswer to the question was \nwhereas if you were to have a retriever \nbefore that you can say okay you don't \nhave to bother with that 100 you can \nbother with the first top five top three \num which the sentence similarity or the \nthe um yeah the retriever sets uh step \nhas decided is the most relevant \nyeah it seems like that uh like going \nbeyond 512 input tokens or maybe 1024 \nthings like sparse transformers do you \nsee that as being a big limitation of \nthis retrieve than read way of setting \nup the task or do you think we usually \ncan fit enough information in that 512 \ntoken input window \nthat you know it's not that big of a \nproblem with it with a strong retriever \nsay \num \nin practice it seems that we're doing \nquite well with a retriever reader \npipeline again there are different types \nof retrievers and this this isn't just \nabout the trend the \nmodel you decide the sentence similarity \nmodel you decide to use it's also about \nhow efficient the document store you're \nusing is \nso uh document store like what you guys \nhave like we've eat \nwhere it's optimized for vectors \num \nis probably going to perform way better \nfor vector search than another one so \nthere's a lot to consider not just not \njust the models you use \nyes i i'm kind of \ni'm thinking about this is inspiring my \nthinking about say the difference \nbetween large language models like gbt3 \nof course and like the thinking around \nin context learning and then the \ncomparison with the retrieve then read \ndecomposition where uh it seems like the \nretrieval model could be you know a \npretty small model like say 100 million \nparameters in the sentence transformer \nseems to be like around the range of \nmost of these and then \nthe question answering i think roberta \nbase is like 300 million right so you \nreally \ncut down the size of these models and \nachieve a sum of performance \ndo you think a lot about that kind of \nlarge language models versus this \nretrieved and read decomposition \nwe actually use them both in common \ncombination combinations right word \nright yeah so um \ni i already mentioned briefly distilled \nmodels but yeah like i said we have um \nso for roberta bass squad 2 for example \nwe have a distilled model called tiny \nroberta squad 2. um this is a way \nsmaller model don't quote me on any \nparameter size i'm not the most savvy \nabout this type of stuff but it is a \ndistilled version of roberta bass squad \n2 i believe \nwhich is way lighter than roberta-based \nsquad 2. \num \nand we know that it performs not as well \nbut nearly as well so it becomes a \nquestion of give and take \nand we when we do use tiny reverter \nsquad two we then also use it in \ncombination with a retriever \nreader pipeline um so what yeah \nwe you can combine a lot of steps that \nthat is going to make your whole \nquestion answering pipeline let's say \nway faster rather than picking one or \nthe other um to achieve a application \nthat is sort of seamless and nice to \ninteract with \nyeah i think that's a fascinating idea \nthat you could have the knowledge \ndistillation go from say like a 100 \nbillion parameter language model all the \nway down into the question answering \nmodel and have interfaces for that \nknowledge distillation i think that's a \nreally interesting kind of area to \nexplore further \nanother thing i'm curious about is say i \nthink right now the way that we mostly \nthink about \ntraining or \ntaking retrieve and reader models is \nthat we train them separately we have \nour sentence transformer it's trained to \ncontrast neighboring paragraphs or \nnext sentences heuristics used to \ndetermine positives for that kind of \ncontrastive similarity task and then we \ntrain our question answering model like \nseparately what do you think about like \nthe idea of joint training where you \nhave like gradients the gradients from \nthe question answering go back into the \nretrieval model do you think that's \nmaybe like unnecessary complexity that \nkind of idea i think they use it i think \nthis gets into the to a branch of nlp \nthat i don't consider myself to have the \nmost knowledge about \nbut i can imagine a scenario where \nmaybe \ntraining \nboth of them with an understanding of \nwhat domain it's going to be used in um \nhand in hand might make sense so i can \nimagine so we even though i say these \nquestion answering models generalize \nquite well there are obviously \nsituations where you will want to \nconsider training or let's not even say \ntraining maybe fine tuning of question \nanswering model to your domain i can \nimagine that you would probably want to \ndo that for a sentence similarity model \nas well so if you decide you want to \nlet's say \ndo a question answering for i think one \nof the ones that came up was biomedical \ndata \nwould it make sense to also \nin line with that decide you're gonna \nuse a retriever so maybe you should have \na retriever with a sentence similarity \nmodel that's been trained for that \npurpose \ni don't know i think it might it might \nmake sense but don't don't quote me on \nthis \nyeah i think the the scientific text and \nwe recently published our we've a \npodcast on scientific literature mining \nand i think what kyle was saying is that \nthe the vocabulary is so different the \nterms are so different that you have \nsuch a domain shift that it it's hard \nfor the wikipedia train books corpus \ntrained models to get over there so so \non the topic of domain adaptation domain \ntransfer in nlp \ndo you think there are some quick tools \nwe can use to get a quick sense of what \nkind of degradation we might expect \nmaybe like \nsome kind of i've heard terms like \nsemantic drift where maybe you look at \ncertain tokens that have like a totally \ndifferent meaning in some other corpus \nor maybe you look at like the tokenizer \nmismatch like \ncertain words are being mapped to the \nunknown token and you just lose \ninformation \ndo you think there's maybe a way to get \na quick sense of domain adaptation as \nwe're like building yeah \ni would \nas a haystack person i would say why not \ntry fine tuning a model to your data and \nthen \nevaluating your model um again you can \nyou can do a lot of these via with \nhaystack too \nso i would say \ngo for it have an evaluation set and see \nhow it performs for you \non this topic of fine-tuning uh like \nsentence transformers so is fine-tuning \nsomething that's built into the haystack \nsuite sort of is can you tell me more \nabout how that works yeah so you can \nyeah you can um \nyou can download a model straight from \nhugging face haystack has a hugging face \num \nintegration um and then say okay now \ncontinue training for x-men epochs with \nmy my data set where where which is at \nthis location \num it's actually i think it's on the \nhaystack documentation it's a \nsurprisingly easy process i did it the \nother day \nis that different from um so is that for \ntraining the retriever models or the \nreader models this is this is for the \nreader model that i'm talking about this \nis for the question answering model i \nthink that's the most common um place \nwhere you would want to fine-tune a \nmodel \nso is that fine-tuning it with the \nretrieval attached to it so it kind of \ngets used to having \nthis is just so the reader model like \nlike you mentioned before is a totally \nseparate \nentity to the to the retriever so the \nonly thing that the reader really cares \nabout is i've got this context this bit \nof text somewhere and i've just received \na question and i'm going to look through \nthis bit of text to find an answer for \nit whether it gets that bit of text from \na retriever or whether you input it via \nthe hugging face inference api for \nexample it doesn't care \ndo you think maybe there's something to \nadapting the question answering models \nto \ni mean i think like with squad right \nit's already trained with the \ncontext like what is the atomic number \nof oxygen it gets a paragraph from \nwikipedia as a part of the input do you \nthink maybe \nfine-tuning it with the kind of noisy \nretrieval end where you know it might \nnot it might give you that paragraph \nfrom wikipedia but it's also going to \ngive you something \nabout maybe like i don't know something \nabout oxygen for underwater i don't know \nlike some like it might give you noisy \ncontext do you think maybe you should \nfine-tune that reader to \neven if you're not putting gradients \nback to the retrieval but like to get \nthe reader used to \nlike i have this kind of noisy \nmy sidekick here is kind of going to \ngive me these funny results and maybe i \ncan get used to it a little bit but the \nthe point of of the reader model isn't \nto know the answers to to something that \nthe point of a reader model is really to \nfind or search for the answers for \nsomething so \num it really is a matter of how how well \ncan you \nhow well can you deduce the answer from \na given bit of context \nlet's say \nso i wouldn't see \nas the point is to be able to look \nthrough unseen data \nthe only the only thing that it has to \nmanage is to be able to be as good as \npossible at looking for the \nthe right answer i think that's the best \nway to summarize it it's like i i um \ndescribed this uh the other day \num as the following so the question \nanswering model \nis a thing \na thing anything that has been trained \nto do just that look for answers \num and what the retriever is doing or \nwhat providing a bit of context and the \nhugging face \ninference api is doing is literally just \nproviding it \nwith the playground \nthat it should do that in or \nor you wanted to do that in \nso \nso this idea of um question answering is \nsearch i think that's very interesting \nand i i think kind of all these language \ntasks are kind of like very similar to \nme like it seems like question answering \ncould encapsulate sort of the setup for \nany of these uh tasks if you phrase you \nphrase any task into a question like uh \nyou know it would say like fact \nverification you'd say do these claim \ndoes this evidence support this claim \nright and now it's question answering \nso do you think kind of all tasks could \nbe mapped into question answering or \nmaybe \nsay language modeling also \nthat's an interesting question and i \ndon't have a straight answer for it but \nit isn't it's an interesting way to \nthink about it \num \nthe reason why well actually one thing \nthat i should point out is that since \nthe beginning of our chat we've really \nbeen talking about question answering in \nthe context of extractive question \nanswering we haven't really been talking \nabout generative question answering the \nreason why we call question answering \nsearch is yes simple because \nthe idea is that an extractive qa model \nlooks for the answer which means that it \ndoesn't generate the answer it also \nmeans that you have it can only answer \nuh a question if the answer exists in \nthe playground you've provided it with \nnow whether \neverything else can be described as a \nquestion answering task \nthat's a tricky one \nbecause \nthen i'm thinking about a lot of other \na lot of other tasks in nlp in general \nsummarization is a question answering i \ndon't think so um \n[Music] \nbut yeah \nyeah i'm really glad you brought that up \nthe extractive verse abstractive thing \nand \nand um maybe like as kind of a quick \nthing i think maybe the \nextractive models are much more like \nready for these kind of production \nsystems like you know haystack we va as \nwe build these tools that we're trying \nto push into like a more like a software \nengineering crowd i feel like the \nextractive models i feel like they make \na lot more sense you can debug them a \nlot easier \nbut then the abstract and models are so \nexciting and they have kind of hacks on \nthem like maybe like the beam search \ndecoding or \nrecently a paper called rank gen they \nthere's like kind of like strategies to \nmake them more interpretable sort of but \nlike in your thinking like do you think \nextractive question extractive models \ngenerally with classification labels \ncompared to this idea where like you're \ngenerating each prediction has a set of \n30 000 possible things and you unroll \nthat sequence like 50 times do you think \nthat's maybe too grandiose for like the \nproduction systems that say a lot of \nthese like open source deep learning \nmeet software engineering kind of \ncompanies are \npushing out there \ni would say so um \nfor a very simple reason \num the the training process of a \ngenerative bear in mind i am not an nlp \nengineer i've really been learning along \nthe way \nbut this is my understanding \nan extractive qa model is trained very \ndifferently to what a generation \ngenerative qa model would be trained as \num and \nthen the question of oh how long did it \ntake for you to train your model to \nanswer these questions that actually \nbecomes very valid for for generative qa \nmodels \nbecause \nthat this this time around the model \nisn't you're not giving the model data \nfor it to search through a generative \nmodel doesn't need context to search \nthrough a generative model is generating \nanswers from the things it's been \ntrained for now you can imagine in a \nscenario where you're a company let's \nsay and you have all these bunches of \ndocuments text data lying about and you \nwant to provide that via a question \nanswering \napplication on your website \nyou have two options you either go with \na \nextractive \nversion and you use a model either you \nuse it pre-trained off the shelf or \nfine-tune it to that data you have maybe \nif if necessary \nbut then you just provide this and you \nprovide the data for it to search for \nanswers in a document store and that \ndata can grow you still use that same \nmodel if you're going for generative \nwhere there isn't a concept of searching \nthrough context for it to still be valid \nin let's say five months time when you \nhave all this new information you're \ngoing to have to think about growing and \ngrowing and growing that model so in a \nreal life scenario where you just want a \nsimple question answering application \nsomewhere i i from my experience so far \ni would say an extractive qa model is \ngoing to be a lot makes a lot more sense \nnow obviously i don't know maybe \nin the near future hopefully we get a \nlot \nmore a lot cooler things out there with \ngenerative models and everyone starts \nusing it but this is my understanding so \nfar \nyeah that reminded me of when uh malt \nfrom haystack was also on the wva \npodcast he gave me three reasons to \nfavor retrieve then read that you \nreminded me of and the first of which \nbeing that it's easier to update the \nmodels and i think that's such a \ncompelling point like \nyou need to update the language model to \nsay like you want to change a fact or \nsomething like that or you're trying to \njust continue the auto regressive \nmodeling task and it \nmight not forget it it's hard to say if \nit did right and so that particular \npoint of the ability to update \ndefinitely sounds very compelling and \nthen the two of the things he mentioned \nwas the interpretability if you see the \ncontext the reader model is using to \npredict so that can help you out \nexactly that's another thing and that's \nactually a really good point because \nwith an extractive qa model you ask a \nquestion and you're not only getting the \nbest answer the the model can come up \nwith you're also getting information of \nwhere that answer was from so in a case \nwhere let's say for documentation where \nyou have a question you want to ask \nand you get the answer but you want to \nread more about it now you know what \ndocument contains that answer and what \nyou can go and learn more about it \nactually \nfor this type of \nscenario then even \nyou can even imagine how \nnot having the answer but the relevant \ndocuments become very compelling too \nright \nyeah yeah yeah it's super interesting \nthe way that you can uh see it of course \nand yeah like i think they try to do \nthings like \nuh they might do like some kind of \nsignature in the training data to try to \nsee what produced the generative \nlanguage model's output like i think \nthere's research like that where they \ntry something like that but \nsurely it can't be as straightforward as \nthis is with the retrieve than read kind \nof thing \nyeah and so then the third thing he had \nsaid was that it's i think something \nthat we've talked about a few times with \ndistillation and sort of is just that \nit's more like economical when you \ndecompose a task you don't need to store \nall the data and the parameters of the \nbig language model and and then yeah you \ncan have like 100 million parameter \nretriever 300 million parameter reader \nrather than gigantic model that does \neverything so i think that was really \ngreat conversation and topics around \nquestion answering and kind of the next \ntopic i really want to ask you about is \nthe \ndeveloper advocate role and creating \ncontent and things like that is \nsomething that i really care about a lot \nand i'm really curious to see hear your \nopinions on on this whole process as \nwell of kind of communicating what \nyou're doing the different mediums of \ndoing so \noh man that's such a big topic um \nso \ni started uh developer advocacy in 2020 \nactually so unfortunately when i started \nfor the first year in a bit we were in \num pandemic \nand we had no live events etc so from \nmoving from now on moving forward um one \nof my main things is really going to be \nlike doing this maybe doing it live as \nwell \num doing community calls and events but \nmy take on developer advocacy is that \nthere there are certain levels of it \nthere's there's one there's one thing of \nbeing um trying to \nlike educate developers on the tool \nyou're a developer advocate for and the \nway i've been doing that is like i said \ni'm not an nlp engineer i come from a \ndeep learning background this is more in \ncomputer vision maybe but \num \nit means that i have now entered a realm \nwhere i'm learning a lot every day so we \nmay listen back to this podcast and \nthere's something wrong i said and i \nlearned \nwhat's what was supposed to be the right \nanswer for example so \nmy aim is going to be and i've started \ndoing that i think i should be doing \nmore is \nteach the community or like tell of the \ncommunity about what i've learned along \nthe way so \nthere's an aspect of \neducating people inspiring people to \nto start \nusing certain tools or getting into \ncertain areas \num and there's also the other aspect of \nmaking \nthe tool that they're using more \ncompelling for them to use for example \num \ni feel like there's so many layers of \ndeveloper advocacy you can do so much \nwith it it's a social \num role it's a \nit's a technical role \num \nbut it's also because of that extremely \nflexible and very prone to to \nto be a role where you can use your \ncreativity a lot \nyeah there's so many different ways of \npackaging up the lessons you learn about \nhow to use the software and trying to \nmake it the mo in the most digestible \nformat for your users or developers \npeople interested in seeing what you \nhave so i've been kind of thinking about \nlike the flow of how these things \nconnect like \nuh one thing i really like is the keras \ncode examples the deep learning \nframework and they have like computer \nvision natural language processing and \nthat kind of organization of the \nexamples and and they implement things \nand it's very like \ni think it's a very great way to get \nstarted so i've been curious about how \nlike maybe we've ate examples we have \nour github repository how we could kind \nof get into that kind of organization \nwhere we have uh \nuse cases like uh e-commerce or uh \narchive like scientific literature \nmining or legal or like the different \nkinds of like real world things and then \nmaybe the applications like uh search \nquestion answering fact verification \nlike kind of sorting starting to look \ninto the nuance of the tasks and that \nkind of thing \nso i've been kind of thinking about how \nyou can maybe go from like github to \nyoutube to medium sub stack like how \nthese different kinds of like platforms \nflow together and i think hugging face \nspaces is also \nemerging as one of these \ncore content platforms for developer \nadvocates do you like do you think \nyou'll view hug or maybe even already \nview hugging face spaces as \nsimilar to github like in terms of the \ncontent platform for showing the code \nlike what would you put more emphasis on \ni \nthink i i view hugging face as a very \nimportant \nmedium for developer advocacy especially \nin the world of \nai and machine learning and nlp \nfor us for example at deep set hugging \nfaces really \nthe the medium where we share our models \nwe've trained with the nlp community and \nfrom now on also give them examples of \nhow these models can be used with \nhaystack \ngithub is where we have our \nframework host our \nsource code for uh the haystack \nframework hosted \num but i feel like hugging face yes and \nit is going to be more and more for me \nuh very \nlike it's it's such an opportunity to to \nget to the people who \nare every day interested in this \nparticular \nbranch of research who are interested in \nquestion answering or summarization or \nanything to do with nlp who would \nbenefit from using haystack or deep set \nmodels but don't necessarily know of \ntheir existence yet but now with hugging \nface \nand the whole community vibe let's say \naround it \num it's it's going to it is already a \nvery important um \ndomain for me to get to those people \nand one other question i want to ask \nabout the uh the game of thrones demo is \nso you have you have such a tangible \nhere's how you do something useful with \nhaystack and you mentioned the idea of \nmaybe having a live audience how would \nyou think about designing that kind of \nlive presentation would it be very uh \nlike \nwhat kind of data sets do you all have \nor \nor let's look at the game of thrones \nthing and really try to understand that \nactually it's a very good question and \non time as well because in a week's time \ni'll be doing this uh in london at odsc \nalongside you actually but i think \nyou're doing it um online aren't you \nyeah unfortunately \nso i'm actually going to be using two \ndemos there um one is a it's a different \napplication it's not the game of thrones \none um and it's a \nlive haystack demo question answering \ndemo about \nworld countries and cities and \ninformation about them for example \num and i don't think i have to focus on \none demo over the other \nor like focus on like the game of \nthrones data set specifically it's more \nabout \ndisplaying how semantic search works and \nhow that's different different to \nkeyword search for example so any live \ndemo application where i can sort of \nportray to people \nhow \ni just asked the question to this \napplication and clearly it's returned an \nanswer but you can already see from the \nanswer that it got an understanding of \nwhat the context was it had a semantic \nunderstanding of what the sentence the \nanswer was in was \num so it's more about that it's not much \nabout the exact data \nyeah and it seems like it seems like \nsuch a generalizable uh pipeline the \nretrieve then read kind of thing too \ni think with with the we've a thing and \nwhat caused me to think a little \ndifferently about it is where we have \nthis kind of like class property schema \nsetup where you can use cross references \nto say achieve \nuh like maybe it's like uh scientific \npaper has author then you also have an \nembeddings for author like you have an \nembedding set for the papers and an \nembedding set for the authors and you \ncan do like multimodal yeah like kind of \nlike hierarchical like uh take advantage \nof the structure of documents with that \nkind of thing so i think that \nintegration with structure is what makes \nit a little tough to just say uh like \nhere's the template that will work for \nyour data set i think it might require a \nlittle more like okay well what kind of \nrelations what kind of like semantic \nontology sort of that kind of thinking \ncan we do in your data and then how can \nwe use that to build better vector \nindexes \ni think that's maybe one thing that \nmakes it hard to think about for me uh \nthink about like a generalizable way to \nsay here is we've and here's how to use \nit for everything kind of like so but \nyeah uh so one other topic i want to \nkind of come into is some of the things \nthat are exciting you about nlp and the \nthings that you're working on \noh man \num that's a that's a big question \num i'm really mostly excited about to be \nhonest with you a lot about what we've \nreally already talked about \nis and it's a challenge for me so i'm \nyeah like i said i'm learning along the \nway \num \nto me \nthe interesting part right now \nis um explaining to people who are not \nlike people like me maybe even \nwho maybe i'm a bit further than that \nright now but who are not nlp savvy \nnecessarily but have been a part of this \nwhole nlp and ai hype \nand they are starting to \nwant to understand and learn how this \nwhole thing works \nso to me the most exciting part right \nnow is taking a step back and giving \npeople the big picture \nwhy do we have this retriever reader \npipeline in the first place what is the \nqa model actually doing \nand it's not it's not that easy \nexplaining this to explaining this to \npeople who are \nuh interested um it's really fun but \nit's not an easy task um so right now \nthat's that's the main thing i'm \nfocusing on \nis it so explaining it from scra from so \nis it explaining the retriever reader \nversus the \nlet's build a massive end-to-end model \nkind of angle of it or here's what a \nquestion answering it model is to begin \nwith \nboth of them so because here's what a \nquestion answering model to begin with \nis a nice leeway to explain why a \nretriever \nwhy a retriever step might be very \nuseful \nthe other thing by the way that is quite \nexciting is um \nlong-form question answering which i'm \nstill wrapping my head around which is a \ngenerative question question answering \num \na \ntechnique where \nyou you get basically long-form answers \nand i haven't got my hands on it yet but \nwe have it available in haystack so this \nis another thing i'll try soon \nyeah that the generative stuff is is \nreally exciting i definitely think \nthere's like going to be a lot of \nopportunity with it and uh quickly this \nis some you quickly mentioned that you \ncame from more the computer vision \nbackground and i also kind of had that \nbackground so maybe i wanted to ask you \nabout uh retrieved and reading computer \nvision does it make sense in that \ncontext where maybe for image \nclassification we're going to do a k n \nsearch and then similarly kind of reason \nabout the label given the additional \ncontext \ni'm now imagining \nfind the \na stack of images where you say find the \ni don't know red ball and you have a \nretriever that gives you the first five \nimages that that a ball might exist in \num yes so computer vision was um i did \nmy computer science bachelors and \nmasters at the university of bristol and \nmy master's thesis was around computer \nvision um so that's how \nmy background is in computer vision um \nsuper cool \nso do you um like are you excited about \nsay clip multimodal embeddings with \nimage text and kind of seeing if this \nretrieve then read thing also kind of \nworks in the multimodal embedding \nproblems like maybe \nvisual question answering \nvision language navigation trying to \nremember the image text like image \ncaptioning those kinds of things \ni think we actually have a few people um \nworking on \nstuff similar to what you're describing \nbut don't quote me for it \num yeah so maybe one day \nyeah \nyeah it's super cool seeing the um \nlike all the different data domains and \nhow i think language \nlike language to me seems to be and i \nsaw a really interesting paper where \nthey were able to turn hyper parameter \noptimization into a language problem and \ni so i think lang in my view language is \nthe most powerful interface maybe that's \na hot take but i think like language you \ncan specify most tasks in language or \nuse language to \nuh specify the task you're trying to \nachieve and put it into the space \nsomehow to get a better representation \nof things \nyes i do think like i i do i'm of quite \na firm believer that we're going to \nstart interacting with machines in \ngeneral in a very different way to what \nwe've been doing so far and i think \nlanguage is going to be one of the top \nthings \nit is already like even even now \nevery every single interaction we have \nwith our machines \nwith our browsers \nhas some \nlanguage aspect natural language aspect \nto it um and on the on the topic of \nlanguage and quest and images \nhow cool is it now we can like describe \nin human \nlanguage \nwhat's art we want and we have models \nthat can do that how insane is that \nyeah the the the dolly thing has been \nlike \ntruly insane to me what do you think \nabout dolly \ni mean i'm just having fun with it \ni'm just having fun with it honestly \num but i i'm really curious as like how \nfar we're gonna go with this like where \nwhere \nwhere's our peak when it comes to this \nsort of thing \nyeah i'm i'm actually a little afraid of \nthe video models once you take dolly and \nthen it \ndoes videos and it can like generate all \nsorts of videos with that super \nrealistic nature to it that sounds to me \nlike a little bit like well that's \npretty crazy deep fake that kind of \nthing \num do you think there's i saw this one \ncriticism from gary marcus about like \ncompositionality in dolly where \nuh that prompted something like a red \ncube stacked on top of a blue sphere \nnext to a yellow cylinder is some \nprompt like that and it's unable to \nchain together these symbolic components \nlike every time i think like i think \nbecause i've seen people also on twitter \nput together crazy prompts like that and \nshow look it did do it so i think it's \nmore so like well it just doesn't do it \nevery time \nso i think maybe this also yes all right \num i was just going to say is \nyeah i mean it's a it's a generative \nmodel isn't it so \num \nbut \nmy view of it would be i'm now curious \ncould you send this over to me after \nthis podcast recording um about the \ncriticism um \nbut \ni'm i like looking at this sort of stuff \na bit like a pollyanna view it's like \nthis is just the beginning obviously not \nnot everything's gonna work perfectly \nbut isn't it insane and quite really \ncool that it can do you know these three \nthings for example anyway you can \nimagine that in the future it's those \nthree things are going to be those 30 \nthings \nyeah that's my exact \nthe thoughts on it too that it can do \nthese three things and i think that's \nkind of like the state of deep learning \ngenerally right now and and i think \nextractive question answering to come \nback to that is more solidly correct \ncompared to the generative models where \nthe generative models and deep learning \nthey're not it's not like correct like a \nsymbolic \nalgorithm like traditional kind of \nsoftware is it's like \nyou know it it might amaze you or it \nmight like totally fail it seems to be \nthe way to look at these things like \nyep and i've also kind of seen that as \ni'm exploring the retrieval models i've \nkind of seen some cases that look like \nthat too where if you look at the \ndistribution of whether it returns the \ncorrect rank it's either one it got the \nexact thing or it's like 10 plus like it \ncompletely missed it and then and then \nyou'll have like low density and two \nthree four five for like evaluating the \nrank order so i think that kind of thing \nif it's either super correct and amazes \nyou or it's completely wrong is maybe \none way to think about \nthe failure of deep learning models \nso anyways i think we covered a really \ngreat set of topics is there anything \nmaybe that we missed out on haystack and \nuh \nand question answering and any general \ntopic \nah no i don't think so but i was just \ngonna ask you the last thing you said \nwas this about the retriever step \nyeah like um looking i'm i'm really \ninterested in trying to \nyou know get my hands up into the \nresearch of it and doing things like uh \nlike the \nmean reciprocal rank \nrecall these kind of metrics to \nlook into the performance of the \nretrieval models and really i want to \ntry to answer this question of \noff-the-shelf model versus fine-tuned \nmodel and explore that for \nscientific papers i think the beir \nbenchmark is one of the best ones out \nthere that has um \ni think it's like \nyeah different \ndifferent information sources like \nwikipedia books maybe legal documents \nand then different downstream tasks as \nwell that are attached to them sort of \nlike wikipedia has fever \nand i know i'm going all over the place \nif people listen to this but there's \nalso like um knowledge intensive tasks \nwhere it's a bunch of downstream tasks \nthat are built on top of wikipedia so \nthis is a way of testing these retrieved \nand read pipelines for different kinds \nof downstream tasks using the same kind \nof information source \nbut yes um i'm really curious in just \nseeing the uh retrieval performance in \ndifferent domains so the beir benchmark \nis like the dream thing that i would \nlike to get to just a side note about \nthe retriever step being super accurate \nlike the top one working out or the you \nknow it's all down the number 10 \nnumber 10 document that it retrieved in \na question answering pipeline really \nif it was a top one life would be super \neasy because then you know the answer is \nin that one right \num \nbut the point of that retrieval step in \nquestion answering is that \nsomewhere \nin the top \nx that's the \nquestion answering \npipeline wanted you to retrieve model \nretrieve documents from somewhere in \nthose top \nx \nthe answer exists so it doesn't yeah \ndoesn't really matter that it's the \nfirst one the third one the tenth one \nit's just how well is it in putting it \nin that top x \nd what do you think about re-ranking the \nlist based on the uh the certainty of \nthe answer classification so \nit might be ranked position seven but \nthe question answering is like i'm 96 \nsure that this is the answer whereas \nwith the one through six it was like 40 \nyou know so like you can kind of correct \nthe retrieval with the re-ranking of the \num \nwe actually have a i think either a \ntutorial or a demo or some some sort of \num demonstration of re-ranking documents \nbased on which one \ncould be maybe the most relevant to the \nquery that was asked and so that's \ndefinitely a use case \num but uh \nin the context of um \na question answering model \num \nit's just received for for the question \nanswering model the only thing it cares \nabout \nisn't the rank it's totally about this \nis the amount of the or the amount of \ncontext i'm going to look through it \nmight decide that the best answer to the \nquestion \nwas \nat in the first document that was \nretrieved it might decide it's in the \nseventh document it retrieved it really \ndoesn't \ncare about the rank that it was given \nthe context in \ni think that's bringing us to another \ninteresting point of whether you want to \nstack all of the retrieved evidence as \ninput so it's like one big input or if \nyou want to run the question answering \nto each thing and i think there's like \nthe \nuh the fusion in decoder is what \nfacebook calls their model of um \nseparately taking each of the retrieve \nfacts and then putting it in that like \nencoder decoder transformer kind of \narchitecture where uh you don't have the \nattention over all the facts at once \nthat kind of difference where uh \nand by doing that you can have like a \nreally massive list of facts compared to \nif you need to do the cross attention on \nthe facts yeah this is where we get into \na whole other \na whole other topic based on um the \ncapacity the input capacity that a \ncertain model has \nyeah \nwell thank you so much tuwana i really \nenjoyed this weeva podcast and i learned \nso much i think this is such an exciting \ntopic to retrieve and read pipelines \nthinking about uh developer advocacy how \nto create kind of artifacts to \ndemonstrate what we're learning the \ndifferent mediums like hugging face \ngithub youtube podcasting and all these \nkinds of things so thank you so much for \ncoming on the vba podcast thank you very \nmuch thank you for having me this was \nfun \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Tuana Celik on Question Answering
