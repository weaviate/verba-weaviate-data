{"text": "A guided conversation about HNSW by Connor Shorten between Yury Malkov, Staff ML Engineer at Twitter and the co-inventor of ... \n[Music] \ntoday we have an incredible guest yuri \nmalkov staff machine learning engineer \nat twitter and one of the inventors of \nthe h sw algorithm which is one of the \ncore drivers of the vector index that \nfacilitates this massive information \nretrieval with the vva vector search \nengine and we also have eddie and \ndillocker co-founder and cto of we v8 so \nthis should be such an incredible \nconversation between hearing about uh \nyuri's perspective as the scientist \ncoming up with these things and building \nthese things out and also eddien's \nexperience of integrating these things \nin we've and i'm so excited to hear the \ntrading of ideas between these two and \nget into all sorts of details between \nthese approximate nearest neighbor \nalgorithms and details of building up \nthese vector index data structures so \neddie and can you tell us about uh your \nexperience with hsw how you came across \nit and the uh the the key questions that \nyou're dying to ask yuri \nyeah yeah i i don't actually even \nremember exactly how i came across it \nbut i do remember that when i saw it i \nwas like wow this is this is this is \nexactly what we're what we need because \nwe were in that phase of sort of uh just \ndoing a proof of concept of vva in \ngeneral like can we add value in that \nspace is there a value for something \nsuch as a vector database which we \ndidn't call that at that time yet \nbecause the term basically hadn't been \ninvented yet um but yeah we were just \nplaying around with with just brute \nforce search just to to basically \napprove the concept and then we we \nlooked into okay how can we do this at \nscale how can we do it more efficiently \nand i came across the hnsw paper and \nit's like wow this is this is kind of \nwhat we need and and the first i \nremember the first thing that i tried \nout was basically \num \ncan we can we incrementally update this \nso because for a database it's very \nimportant that you don't just build your \nyour data set once and then you have it \nand then it's basically read-only um and \nyeah \nwould this be something that was \npossible and to my surprise it actually \nwas and not just was it possible but it \nseems like the entire design about how \nyou insert data into an hnsw index \nrevolves around the idea that you just \nbasically use it to search it um which \nis really cool for for a database and \nthen we we can get more about this later \nwe added some more things to add \nfiltering to it and uh deletes and these \nkind of things and that really made it a \ngreat uh base for for a database yeah so \nfirst of all yuri welcome and thank you \nvery much for making that that kind of \nresearch open and so that we can build \nupon it and um yeah what i'd like to \ndive uh into is basically the first \nquestion how how did you get this idea \nwhere does it come from like what what \ndid you do or or was there was there \ndemand because it's i think if i see \ncorrectly the paper was first released \nin 2016 and even to this day we're \nseeing that new users are coming to vba \nthere's a certain portion who's actively \nlooking for vector search but there's \nalso a person a portion of users who \ndon't even know what that is who just \nsee the benefits and want to get into \nthis so thinking back six years this \nmust have been such a novel idea was \nthis driven by user demand for for a \nfaster a n search or was this more of a \nresearch topic basically that interested \nyou and how how did you get to to build \nthis \nuh hello so uh yeah it has a much longer \nhistory \nso uh there was a predecessor of hmsw \nuh and uh well yeah maybe the release of \nhcw actually uh \naffected by the surge of interest \nso the the \nthe the predecessor for uh hmsw was like \nwe call it nsw or msw so it was \nstarted development developing i think \nin like something like 2005 \nso \nway before \nthis time and uh yeah i should \nmention some people who are also working \nthere so i work with like \nthe idea there was that we should build \nthe \ndistributed search system that will \nscale to petabytes \nand it was a kind of a mix of uh \nof a symbolic \nsearch system and uh like a vector but \nmostly symbolic so the idea there was \nlike we have objects \nuh so like there's \nof things we have lots of uh devices \nthere so they have some properties like \nin the three form and uh we like make a \nthree form queries \nand search there like using that and the \nthe idea was to use small world networks \nuh to do that and \nso we had other papers \nuh based on that and uh like this word \nwas pick up by leonid boitsov at some \npoint and \nso he implemented it in the \nenema slip which is like one of the \nlibraries \nthat you can use for nearest neighbor \nresearch and uh when he implemented it \nhe had also worked with some other \npeople like nikita avril and \nand uh \nalso alexander \nso uh there was a like it turned out \nthere is an interest but because before \nthat there was like \nvery little interest so there is there \nwas interesting from the search \ncommunity \nthat is uh like who did uh \num \nwe did algorithms for general \nuh metric search but uh there were i \ndidn't see any like this much interest \nfrom uh community that did \nuh vector nearest neighbors church so we \nwere targeting at the general metric \nspaces \nso and \nonly at some point we switched to like \nthis euclidean and because like a sign \nsimilarity spaces just because there was \na demand for that \nbut uh before that that was a \ncomplicated like graph \nspace matrix \nand uh well essentially \nhnsw \nuh was a solution to uh \nscalability issues that we have so the \nprevious algorithm had a \npoly logarithmic scalability so it was \nlog n squared \nand uh so and we \nrealized \nwhat was the reason for that so we made \na fix and that was uh hmsw \nwow this is this is so cool hearing how \nit goes back even further and \nnoticing this transition from yeah from \nmetric space into into um cosine or dot \nwhich we basically use for for vector \nsimilarity comparison today \nand um that is actually something that \nnow that you you say we are using in vva \nwe're actually also using hmsw for um \nfor geo search so this was because our \npoc that we built uh was built on um \non elasticsearch at the time just for \nfor general search and that was a \nfeature there and then we trans when we \ntransition is that okay we also need a \nsolution to to do yeah just geo \ncoordinates to basically just find what \nis uh what is related or not related but \nsort of what is the shortest distance in \nyeah in a circle around it and um i \nthink at some point we just tried this \nout if well mention this w we already \nhad it could we just plug in a different \ndistance function and it worked and i \nkind of almost forgot about it again but \nit's super cool to hear that this was \nactually the history of it that is not \njust a coincidence but yeah this was was \npart of of um \nwhere it originally uh came from \num yeah i've mentioned um \nthe fact \nthat we can build up an hmsw index \nincrementally and this is something that \ni i just have to ask this is this was \nthis a design decision or was this more \nof a more of a coincidence um so so if \nyou you say the history is um yeah \nwithin \nsearch already that that makes a lot of \nsense but did you actively try to \nachieve this or was this yeah basically \na coincidence that that we can change it \nincrementally \nuh yeah that was a design decision so \nbasically so \nso it also went from history so the \nprevious algorithms uh that we use were \nkind of the same so they were based on \nincremental insertions but uh so like in \nterms of library and uh \nperformance for there is a public \nlibrary that i support hmsw leap so i \ndidn't support features that would block \nuh like this \nthis feature so the incremental \ninsertions so \nand initially the idea was that we are \nkind of building like a peta scale \ndatabases and they're like it's a it's \nimpossible not to \nbuild it incrementally \nand uh so they're also there like \nthey were distributed there was uh like \nplanted support like \nincreasing the size of the \nuh storage like dynamically so we can \nadd nodes \nto the the system so yeah that was a \ndesign decision so \nit should be dynamic \nreally cool and especially that you say \nthat you had databases in mind um \nbecause when we chose it well we knew \nthat we wanted to build up a database \nbut of course we didn't know that \ndecision but we basically picked hmsw \namong other things because um it allowed \nfor that incremental and as you say for \na database there's there's really no \nother way \num \nyeah so something that um to dive a bit \ndeeper into into how h and sw work uh \nsomething that you have in there is this \num i think in the code it's just called \nthe heuristic two which is basically a \nway to to trim the connections and to \nkeep those uh \nto yeah to the most valuable uh can you \nexplain to our our viewers sort of um \nwhat it does and then also how you came \nup with that because i think when i read \nthis the first time and and saw what it \ndoes i thought it was pretty genius and \ni wanted to to know yeah how does one \ncome up with such a such a heuristic \nwell uh \nyeah so there are also predecessors that \nhelp this come up coming up with this so \nbasically uh so there is a \na general no solution to the \nchurch in \ngraphs in proximity graph so you have a \ndilenoid graph \nwhich is uh like a dual duo of uh \nvaranoit isolation so you you like every \ngreedy search in this graph will end up \nat the exact nearest neighbor so what i \nknow it isolation is basically so you \nhave a space you have points and uh so \nyou have and you divide this space \nuh so that like each cell uh corresponds \nto the nearest neighbors of the \nuh element which is the center of the \ncell so it is pretty basic \nand uh \nso like if you look on theory so there \nare uh sub graphs \nof this dylanograph because well this \ngraph has a huge problem like huge \nperformance implications if you try to \napply it to vector spaces because uh uh \nso well maybe yeah \nyeah so there is a uh like a theorem \nand we can prove it which was done and \nwork on spatial approximation three 3 \nthat if you have a general metric space \nso you cannot have access to all the \npoints you don't know like what else \npoints can be \nin the space uh \nthere is no way that you can \nreconstruct the exact uh \ndyno graph from those points or or any \nsub graph like \ni mean \nlike that the graph that has \nthat has uh the graph as a sub graph so \nthat will be like fully connected graph \nso you can come up with some examples uh \nwith new points because that that can be \narbitrary so \nyou will have you will have to connect \nevery point to each other which \nobviously doesn't scale \nuh \nyou know there are sub graphs and one of \nthe \nsub graphs uh well one is one \nnear nearest neighbor graph so the \nthe graph in which you connect to \nuh the first nearest neighbor \nso that is also always a sub graph of uh \ndylanograph but also there is a relative \nneighborhood graph \nuh which is also \nuh \nlike a a sub graph \nbut \nso there is a like a general \nway to extend this graph so add add few \nedges \nuh because there is like some ambiguity \nand how you define so if you just create \na relative neighborhood graph it would \nnot be \nuh it would not be searchable uh \n[Music] \nlike for the points inside this graph \nso well basically basically you can \nthink of the uh \nlike this \nrng like extended graph \nor heuristic it builds the graph that's \nsupposed to be \nuh searchable uh for the points inside \nthe graph so if you if you like one of \nthe points inside the graph uh and do \ngreedy search it it should end up in \nthis point so it will find it \nso that that that that is a reasonable \nheuristic and like a nice property of it \nis that in the one g space it uh \nit goes to \njust the list \nso \nso it translates to a simple list \nand and that way like hmsw was like \nlike \nlike converting into a skip list which \nis well known algorithm \nso this was known before actually so uh \nso i i i first saw like similar \nuh heuristics in a spatial approximation \ntree which also had this theorem which \nis a nice paper but uh uh like after i \nlike first published the paper on \narchive i did the search and found that \nit actually was used before in \n1992 \nin 1993 by area and mount though like i \neven though i had cited actually this \npaper in my paper i haven't noticed that \nthey actually use it \nso that i was focused on something else \nbut uh so this uh heuristic is like \npretty obvious if you \nthink about it \nand i know there are some extensions but \nthe so it's they are all kind of going \naround it \naround the same solution \nyeah yeah i i would imagine that it \nbecomes pretty obvious if you have that \nkind of a background on on what already \nexists and of course also if you have \nnarrowed down \nthe problems so to speak like if you if \nyou um \nyeah if you're looking for a solution to \num yeah basically keep only the most \nvaluable edges and not keep keep so many \nso um yeah i think what's \nwhat's very obvious to you here um yeah \ni think this would have taken \nme or someone else just um looking at it \nwithout that that kind of research \nbackground wouldn't have been so so \nobvious \num yeah maybe so like a good example \nwhere uh \nlike it's one g so that was also well uh \ninitially i saw when the rotation is w \npaper it didn't have this heuristic \nuh \nand uh so but it was performing also \nlike rather well it was performing much \nbetter than the previous algorithm on \nsome data sets but uh like it lost to uh \nvp3 on \non a few data sets and uh so because \nthose data sets were \nvery low dimensional and we knew that if \nyou just connect to nearest neighbors on \none d \nso you will have like lots of connected \ncomponents so you don't have a single \nconnecting components it's like easy to \nvisualize so you would need to have a \nlist \nthere and the \nso \nlike if you target low dimensional data \nso that that that is kind of like \nuh also \nit's simple to understand why \nyou should use it yeah cool \num so \nnext thing on my list something that we \ndo with uh hnsw and this may also be \nsomething that that yeah i don't know if \nit was ever intended but it's something \nthat that works great and that i was a \nbit surprised about that it worked so \ngreat um so one of the usps in vv8 is \nthat you can do a filtered vector search \nso basically apply your your scalar \nfilter \num \nin the same way that you would do it in \nany kind of traditional \nsearch engine and then just have um yeah \nthe vector search only on those loud \nitems the way we do it is basically um \njust as this we have an inverted index \ninverted index basically gives you an \nallow list of ids and then uh when we \ntraverse the h and sw graph basically um \nwhile we follow every connection which \nof course we need to do so that we we \nkeep discovering the graph \nwe only add to the result set those that \nare on the on the um \non the allow list basically and that \nthat works really well and um at first \nwe yeah we just tried it out and and \nthought it was was yeah it led to the \nresults that we expected um and the \nfirst time we actually measured it i was \nreally surprised that the recall doesn't \ndrop at all yes it varies a bit \ndepending on how how more you increase \nthe filter um but overall it it yeah it \nit it kept pretty constant like even if \nit went to to the very restrictive \nfilters then of course it gets slower \nand slower because in the end it's \nbasically a greedy search or a brute \nforce search through the entire entire \nspace um but the quality doesn't drop in \nand the point where it gets slow only \ncomes very late so what we do in vivian \nis basically like if we know that the \nsearch will be this restrictive we \nactually just skip the index which is to \napproach for a search anyway and then \nonly on those allowed ids and then of \ncourse it's faster again then then um \nyeah having the index search for \neverything and discard most of the \nthings \num yeah can you maybe also give a bit of \nbackground of why that is why the the \nintegrity basically of the graph \nkeeps so high or why this works or if if \nthis is something that yeah you maybe \nyou've thought about or used this as \nwell or \num \nyeah oh \nso yeah so it's very nice that you made \nit work so uh \nwell it was kind of intended but uh we \nnever tested it so the idea was uh that \nyou can change your existence on the fly \nso the there there might be a difference \nbetween like the distance which you \nbuilt the index and the which are used \nfor querying and that is kind of \nthe same thing so you are like \nchanging the distance a bit \nuh \nwell if there is an overlap between the \nlike you can think of the of the if you \nhave one metric and it has some optimal \ngraph you have a second metric and it \nhas somewhat different graph there is \noverlapping neighbors \nso that it should work \nso if there is an overlapping neighbor \nso you filter out those elements and \nthe \nlike \nuh like most of their this half of the \nneighbors are the same so you should \nhave like it isn't performance \nbut uh yeah so that is complicated thing \nso like we we discussed it and we had \nsome previous algorithm but uh it never \ni don't think it ever worked properly so \nuh when we tried it we ended up in \nbuilding like special structures to \nsupport \nuh the search so you have like one index \nmatch so you build the sub index for it \nso we try to build that and like that \nwas pretty messy and i thought \nwell that probably should be the optimal \nsolution so when you like you have uh \nlike your set of possible parameters and \nyou partition them like group them and \nbuild separate index for them if you \nknow that the user is likely to have \nlike searching this set you you can \nspeed up and build a separate index for \nthat \nbut that is very messy like i'm not a \nspecialist in those kind of optim \noptimization so i never even tried it \nbut it's nice to see that uh like \nyou made it work \nyeah uh yeah yeah it's interesting that \nyou mentioned the the partitioning \nbecause this is also something um that \nwe \nthat we have i i don't want to say we \nhave it in yeah basically have it \nplanned because the way that we \npartition so right now if you have in \nnvidia in a distributed setting um \nbasically the entire index just gets \ncharted across \nall the nodes that you have so basically \nthat means each each subgraph so to \nspeak or each graph basically just only \ncontains a specific portion um \nright now this is random right now we \nuse we use basically a hashing function \nbased on the id and we are only the \nassumption that the id doesn't sort of \nfollow any kind of pattern so it's \nbasically the goal as of now is just to \nget it evenly distributed that i don't \nknow if you have a memory limit on one \nof the notes \nthat basically yeah you can distribute \nit among many nodes but something that \nwe can do there is we can do that \nsharding based on one of those \nproperties that we know that that would \nbe filtered for so for example something \nthat we see quite often is that people \nwant to use multi-tenancy on vb8 and \nthat the tend would then basically be \nthe partitioning key and then if we have \na filter where we said like tenant is \nfive then all we'd have to do in this \ncase is knowing okay ten and five lies \non node three and node three basically \nhas its own html graph and then from the \nperspective of h and sw on that node \nit's basically an unfiltered search \nbecause yeah we've already chosen the \nright graph which i think is the the \nsame thing um \nbasically a very similar thing to what \nyou just mentioned \num this is actually a perfect perfect \nsegue to the next point um so i want to \ngo bit into \nyeah right now we've talked about sort \nof why hmsw is the way it is and how \ncertain things work and i'm also very \ninterested in \nhow where things can go from here so \nsomething that i have um \non my and my list is just talking about \nmemory in general so maybe for our \nviewers um the way that hmsw is designed \nand please correct me if i'm wrong there \num it's basically that both the graph as \nwell as the vectors are held in memory \nso that is just an assumption basically \nthat's that's there which is for \nfast fast lookup basically both both for \nfast distance computation is for \nfollowing the edges efficiently \nand this basically means that if you \nhave massive data sets your memory \nrequirements also grow that of course \ndepends on the build parameters but as a \nvery very rough estimate what we've seen \nis basically that if you if you roughly \ncalculate with two times the amount of \nall your vectors it it always sort of \nsort of more or less matches a very very \nrough estimate exact of course yeah \ndepends on the number of edges so if we \nthink about \nbillion scale vector search um that \nis a lot of memory that we could \npotentially use and something that we've \nseen pop up is basically to \ntry and tackle this at what i would call \nthe application site so something that \nthat's been a popular release binary \npassage retrieval in the context of nlp \nso basically there the idea \nis that the vectors get compressed so to \nspeak into binary vectors where each \nvector only holds a sub-portion of the \ninformation that the vector dimension \ndid before \nin bpr it's basically just if the the \nvector \nif each element of the vector was \npositive then it's the one if it was \nnegative then it's a zero so you really \nbasically lose so if you go from a \nfloat32 vector to this binary vector you \nbasically lose um \nuh \n30 130 \ntwo parts or basically sorry you \nbasically reduce it to 130 um yeah \none over 32 of the original size lose \nthat kind of information but of course \nalso lose the the amount of memory that \nyou need to to store and basically also \nincrease the search speed um the \ndownside of something uh like a binary \npassage retrieval is that the way that \nit's seen right now you also need to \nmake your model aware of this so \nbasically because you're outputting \ncompletely different vectors typically \nyou would have a loss function that \nwould optimize for both the the original \nboth the cosine or dot product or \nwhatever it is lost and also this this \nbinary loss which should then typically \nbe a hamming distance between the the \ntwo vectors so what i'm thinking is \nthat the main topic here being \ncompression \nthis this kind of compression it's a in \nthis case of course a loss full \ncompression but might also be other ways \nto do this um \nif we do this at the application layer \nwould there also be a chance to somehow \nget this \nor this or other uh \ncompression techniques product \nquantization or something like this into \nh and sw itself so that basically we say \nthe vectors as they are \nare just sort of they they stay the same \nyour model is the same \nbut at the index side we're trying to \ncompress the vector somehow is this \nsomething that you could see compatible \nwith hnsw or anything that maybe you've \neven thought about already \num well \nyeah i i thought that that is already \nimplemented in libraries so uh one thing \nlike one one one solution is supported \nby phase so you can build the uh h and \nsw or i think it also now supports other \ngraph indices or uh quantized data so \nthere is an option for that so uh i also \nhad a like i call first the paper uh in \neccv 2018 uh which also did the \nquantization a and the hnsw but uh like \nfrom a different perspective that hnsw \nis used for uh \nlike uh cluster selection \nuh in uh like in in ivf \nand uh like as far as i know that is \nstill state of the art and uh like in \nbillion scale search so you can use a \nmuch more clusters because you use like \na graph index so that they're like we \nused one million clusters for one \nbillion elements and then you do \nproduct quantization there and like with \nsome tricks that like my co-authors \nintroduced to save space \nand uh yeah that works pretty well so \ni think this solution is better than the \none that is implemented in face or it \nwas implemented i'm not sure maybe they \nsupport both because uh \nin graph intercessors there is a \nso you have an overhead on the links \nand uh like it's hard to compress links \nso and if you cluster the elements uh so \nthat saves more space \nuh like if you like put them into a \nsingle giant cluster \nuh it loses a \nrecall for sure but uh like it's a \nbetter way to save space than if you \nreduce the dimensionality of the element \nat least to some point \nbut uh yeah so you can do both \nand well there are comparisons and like \nin the in the literature \nso people try that i think \nthat is really great and that is cool \nbecause i didn't know about \num face doing this this um yeah you know \nso if they got you correctly they're \nbasically \num doing the quantization on the data \nand then just using h and sw normally is \nthat \nthat yeah \nwell yes so that that was published in \n2018 \ni think on cbpr so since uh there there \nwere other papers \nbased on that uh like i think extension \nat least like i review papers uh for \ncurrent uh ictv so i see that there are \nlike follow-up papers coming on that so \nbut i'm not sure like which of them were \npublished but that that paper was \ndefinitely published and that is a part \nof uh like face open source \nnice this is definitely something that \nwe have to check out both the \nimplementation as well as the the \npapers of course \num \nyeah on a potentially similar topic um \nif we're \nyeah another way maybe of \ntackling this problem is to also rely on \nthe disk and um something that we we've \nseen pop-up is microsoft's disk a n for \nexample and um there they also have the \nproblem that it couldn't be updated so i \nthink the the newest revision is a fresh \ndisk a n \num in general do you think hmsw the way \nthat it is right now could suit itself \nto yeah storing parts of it on disk and \nhow would that how would that look like \noh \nyeah sure i think there were like \nprevious papers though i'm not sure if \nthey're like super incremental editions \nuh like i think also by microsoft that \nuh like used hybrid \nhardware \nuh so like hmsw on top and like \nquantization and storing and this is \nthis in in the \nin the bottom so that makes sense \nbut uh that is more complicated so you \nare adapting \nmore to hardware that you need that you \nhave so \nit's just like \nit's uh it's engineering it's hard \nengineering so you need to have some \nhardware set you need to optimize to \nwork it properly \nso that totally makes sense so that can \nbe ssg that can be like distributed \nstorage like \nuh \nyeah but uh it's hard one \ncool yeah but that's it's good to know \nthat in general because i mean hard \nproblems to figure them out that's \nthat's what we're here for and that's \nwhat our engineers are here for um but \nit's always good to know that yeah in \ngeneral uh that's a direction that that \num yeah that we can go \num \nspeaking of a hybrid approach \nthe idea of building something something \nhybrid from a very high level \nperspective is also something that we've \nhad before we're just thinking \nnot so much going going into changing \nthe algorithm itself but if we were to \njust take let's say two out of the box \nalgorithms one that supports incremental \nbuilding and one that that doesn't so \nfor example uh if i'm now taking uh \nlet's say google scan or something which \nwhich is not \nincrementally \nupdatable and hnsw and if i try to sort \nof build a hybrid system um where the \nidea that i have in my head right now \nbut maybe there's way better ideas would \nbe that well we say everything that's \nthat's continuously imported basically \nwe want to keep in the in the fresh \nindex so to speak in the h and sw index \num and after a while we say like okay \nlet's build a second index so assuming \nthat the data hasn't changed anymore in \nthat index um \ncould we build it up into something like \nyeah in this case scan \nstore that and reset basically the the \nfresh index and the idea of why we want \nto want to keep the fresh index at all \nin place is basically that stuff is \nimmediately searchable so that that \ndatabase you expect your import to to be \nimmediately searchable um \nand then of course one of the challenges \nwould be \nhow do we handle deletes like what if in \nif we assume delete comes in in the \nfresh index then that would be easy \nbecause there we can still handle it \nbefore we sort of compress it to the \nstatic index um \nbut yeah \nover time would probably be some sort of \na some sort of a compromise of marking \nsomething as deleted and rebuilding \nsomething similar to like a compaction \nin um in a traditional um lsm tree \ndatabase or something like this yeah i \nwas wondering what do you think of this \nthis idea is there something in general \nthat you say \num yeah there is a potential in this \nkind of things if we assume that we can \nuse indices that have \nfewer memory requirements or something \nlike this or would you say this is \npotentially especially as you already \nalso mentioned a hybrid approach this is \nmaybe the wrong approach to to combine \nthese things maybe there's a better \napproach if you want to achieve the same \ngoals \nwell uh like as a \nperson who worked on on the indices i \nthink those can be yeah those can be \nlike joined together \nso uh scan is using like trees as as uh \nas like divide and conquer uh \nso and it has like fast uh \nquantization uh scheme so i when i first \nsaw skan i heard that was kind of \ncheating \nbecause uh \nlike it uh it does not really \nuh \n[Music] \ndecrease the computation whether it's \nkind of speeds them up and uh like there \nwas n and benchmark and some of the data \nsets there were actually integer \nuh but uh like you can rewrite your uh \nmetric function to be \ninteger instead of fourth and everyone \nuse fault and like you can have a \nspeedup up so that oh they are kind of \ncompressing the data \nbut \nyeah scan actually works sometimes \nbetter uh on \nflow data as well so \nbut yeah you can combine them uh there \nis also like for for the deletion point \nof view i think deletions are pretty \nuh costlier and graph indices so uh h9sw \nsupports \ndeletions so that was uh \nessentially it was \nlike initially it was supported by \nflagging the elements which was \ncontributed \nuh and then there was a contribution by \nadding full deletions so like that when \nthe graph was rerouted but that is very \nexpensive so uh one deletion is uh like \nequivalent to like many tens of up like \ninsertions \nso when well incision is not deletion \nit's an update but uh \nif you plug an element as deleted and \nthen updated to a new element that is \nlike pretty much the same as \ndeletion so \na reasonable strategy it would be just \nto just flag the deleted elements \nand then when you \ndelete like half of them you rebuild the \nindex so your complexity does not change \nyou have like a constant because like \nyour you delete twice the elements and \nyou build index once so \nlike scaling does not change \nso uh i think that would be a better \nlike from the library point of view \nthat's like that's up to user so we \ncannot just rebuild the index \nuh \nlike in background that should be \ncontrolled \nbut uh like for a live like for for a \nservice i think that makes sense \nso yeah yeah this is actually this is \nvery interesting that you mentioned this \nbecause this is exactly what we're doing \nright now just we're not i i think we \nhave a relatively short period that we \nused to to rebuilding basically so um we \nare doing the flagging as well and and \nbasically then we just have an async \nprocess where the user can control when \nit runs but basically we do this based \non time at the moment so we don't do it \nbased on the size so probably as you say \nsince it's basically rebuild \nit might be more efficient to basically \nwait longer or to maybe make the \nthreshold not so much time based but \nyeah space we say i don't know if 25 or \nso of the index are deleted we do an \nentire rebuild so that's \nyeah like for \nfrom a point of writing a paper so you \nhave like some degradation of \nperformance like in terms of uh like uh \nso what would happen if if you delete \nthe element so your performance will go \nup or if you add a new element uh \ninstead so it will \ngo down because of the new elements so \nthere is a like if you set a threshold \non performance it probably wouldn't \nwould depend on how much what percentage \nof the data set you have deleted \nso \nso \nlike for a comparison point of view so \nthat would be like i think the optimal \nstrategy yeah yeah that makes a lot of \nsense and definitely something that i \nthink we don't have a lot of a lot of \nmetrics yet on what the actual cost is \nover time because typically what we've \nseen in the use cases so far is the \ndeletions are somewhat rarer than \nimports um but yeah there's a lot of \nroom probably for for improving this \num \nyeah coming up to me to my last question \nactually already um \nwe've talked a bit about the the future \nof hmsw right now and you've also \nmentioned that there is of course future \nresearch um but maybe as a whole would \nyou say hnsw is in a sense basically \nit's complete or would you say there are \ncertain things that that yeah should \nstill follow or \nyeah so sort of \nlet's say five years from now ten years \nfrom now uh do you think the learnings \nfrom hsw would make it into something \ncompletely new or do you think maybe \nthere's there's things that would be \nincorporated in it or maybe something \ncompletely different basically how do \nyou see the long-term future of of hsw \nas a as a concept basically \nseriously \ni i hope that it will last for long so \nlike the main idea of hnsw is that you \ncan \ndo like the main idea that i like that \nyou can do \na search with algorithmic complexity \nwell at least low dimensional data \nuh with the graph structure so graph \nstructure is known like to perform well \nand you can like have \nboth \nbest of both worlds so you can have like \nuh searching in graph and also \nalgorithmic scalability of the trees \nand the like graph are probably better \nthan trees because they don't need to \nbacktrack so if you're using the search \nindex like \nwell not annoying but like similar with \nbacktracking \nuh so you have you lose some performance \nbecause there is like a symmetry of the \nlinks in the graph \nso and well hmsw is a simple fix \nto \nget the algorithmic scalability \nuh well there are many ways how the like \ninitial papers can be improved so as \nmentioned the heuristics might be \nupdated in some papers uh there is also \ni think in some companies and some \npeople use a different construction \nstrategy so they add elements from the \nbottom \nlike when you have a new element or they \nadd to the bottom layer and then i \nconvert to the \nhigher level that \nends in better performance \nuh \nalso like \nthere are works on like earlier \nterminating strategy \nuh \nworks or like uh automatic tuning so you \ndon't need to figure out the parameters \nso right now is like a big issue for \nlike many of the libraries that users \ndon't know how to tune the parameters \nand uh like there are i think only a few \nlibraries that support automated \nparameter tuning \nand the yeah that \nis a nice thing so uh also there are \ni think there are there is a good \ndirection on improving the graph uh with \nml so right now it doesn't have any \nmachine learning \nuh so it's assumed that uh every element \nin the graph can be like a query but \nthere might be a query distribution \nwhich is like very different \nand \nso \nit is \nso there is a there is an application \nlike in recommender systems \nuh like if you don't use inner product \ndistance uh uh but like embed your items \nin some complex spaces there is a chance \nthat some items are like they will never \nappear \nin search with inner product it can kind \nof tell it because it's like it's \nusually close to zero \nbut if you are using something more \ncomplicated \nuh \nor you just like going better than uh l2 \nyou cannot tell that \nbut if you have a query set you can \nactually understand \nthat uh \nsome of them elements they are never \nreturned you can just remove them from \nthe graph and don't waste memory \nuh and like links uh on those elements \nuh \nso \nyeah there are \nyeah many ways to do that and one of the \nlike future i thought that it was going \nto be distributed at some point \nso \nlike when you're trying to do like \ntrillion \nuh elements in the data sets so like you \nhave to distribute it and uh it's not \nreally clear how like what is the best \npractical way of doing that so initially \ni thought that it's going to be like you \nhave an element and it resides on some \nnode and you have links so it's \nmentioned in the paper so you can you \ncan try to make it \nuh distributed because skip list was \nmade distributed before and this is kind \nof like a skip list \nin some sense \nuh but that might not be the best \nstrategy so you still need like a lot of \nhopes and each hope is a hope to a \ndifferent node in the network \nso that is very costly you might also \nwant to \nlike \naggregate those at some point \nyeah so everyone so i think we've just \ngotten quite a master class on these \nvector index algorithms and unless eddie \nhas one more question i was going to try \nto kind of maybe parse this a little bit \nand give people maybe beginner people \nkind of a little bit because they might \nhave gotten a little bit lost in some of \nthe details of this but any more uh \nquestions that ian or no no thanks i've \nlearned a lot today um and this was \nsuper super interesting and i'm i'm \ndefinitely very interested in a couple \nof links to some of the papers that \nyou've mentioned if you could provide \nthose that would be that would be super \ngreat \nyeah sure \nyeah i've got quite the reading list too \nwith um i think billion scale \nsimilarities search with gpus um yuri \nmentioned revisiting the inverted \nindices for billion scale approximate \nnearest neighbor search is a recent one \nbuilding up on these ideas that we just \nlearned about but to kind of step back a \nlittle bit i think um yeah that was \ndefinitely a master class and you two \nknow so much about these things that i \nthink um you did do like drill into this \nlanguage and just to kind of maybe \nprovide a little more of uh of like a \nintroduction to people i i really liked \num in the beginning eddie and mentioned \nthe searching through geo coordinates \nand this was this is the first blog post \ni ever published on towards data science \nactually the first thing i ever even put \nout there before a youtube video is this \nidea of of doing a geospatial search and \nusing say k-means clustering to have \ncentroids that speed up compared to say \ndoing a brute force distance calculation \nbetween your query latitude longitude \nand then every latitude longitude in \namerica so you do these or wherever \nyou're searching so you do these k-mean \ncentroids and i think that's a great \nexample for people out there listening \nto build up an intuition of what we're \ntalking about is you uh you structure \nthese centroids and then you can \npropagate them up and as we talk about \nthese um \ndifferent ways of say having a small \nworld graph you have this property that \nsmall world graphs describes this idea \nthat i'm say six people away from \nknowing barack obama \nthrough my relationships and that's this \nnetwork science thing that that also \nbehaves nicely with these um \nnearest neighbor distances and this idea \nof vector distances one topic that was \ntalked about that i think is extremely \ninteresting is this generalization from \nyou know one dimensional distance we can \nuse just a binary search tree then \ntwo-dimensional distance we get into \nthat geo-coordinate search and then you \nknow n-dimensionals we're talking about \nuh these different ideas like say binary \npassage retrieval that edian mentioned \nwhere we have the binary encoding to \nspeed up having to put these massive \nvectors into the memory and then things \nlike one other thing i wanted to talk \nabout and ask about was uh the locality \nsensitive hashing algorithm where \nsay you have a you know ten thousand \ndimensional vector and you just kind of \nuh hit like i think it's like fifty uh a \nslice of scientific the dimensions to do \nthat kind of um distance calculation \nwhat do you think about uh locality \nsensitive hashing as a way of computing \nthe distance \nuh well \nlocality sensitive hashing is not \nlearnable so it doesn't have any \nlearnable component so uh that that \nthat's why i i thought it was not \npractical \nso there are lots of like papers and \ntheory so because you don't have any \nlike dependence on data \nuh in terms of \nthe projections so like you can build \nsome theory and like have nice \ntheoretical papers about it \nbut uh like i never saw it like it to be \nlike really practical and to outperform \nlike optimized \nuh tribals \nso and i thought that uh like people who \ndo it they also see like uh like \nquantization \nbased algorithms uh like as \nbetter because they are learnable like \nthey can adapt to the \nuh the the \ndata set that you have \nso could we also take a little uh give a \nlittle more background about product \nquantization is product quantization \nbasically the idea of you have your \npre-trained embeddings and then you \nlearn a linear mapping into a lower \ndimensional space from that pre-trained \nembedding or can you give me just more \nunderstanding of how product \nquantization works \nwell i'm not a big specialist in product \nquantization but \nessentially what it does in the simplest \nform so you have a vector \nand you \nwell you want to do \nquantization and uh well you can do like \njust quantization of each dimension \nuh but you will lose some information \nand what people do they uh well or on \nthe other end you can do quantization uh \nin terms of k means so you have your \ndata you build k means \nand now your quantize it but there is \nsomething in between and that is product \nquantization so you have your vector \nwhich is subdivided by parts and you do \nk means in each of the parts \nand now you have like a sub vector and \nuh like \nit is \naddressed by a k means cluster in it \nso and that works well pretty reasonable \nin many cases yeah i want to ask um one \nmore uh uh definition what are uh \nvoronoi regions \nuh what voronoi regions are so like you \ndivide your space into cells \nuh which are closer to some point of \nyour uh database like \nso like you have a vector space you have \npoints and \nso you divide just the space around \nthose points so that uh like \nevery point in the cell \nis \nis \nhas this element as the closest \nso \nbasically you divide the space but by \nwhat \nare the nearest neighbors of those \nelements so as i was listening to the \nexplanation of adding symbolic filters \ninto h sw which to me is one of the most \nunique features that are that has been \nimplemented in wev8 and i think it's \nsuch an interesting part of this could \nyou tell me more about how this works i \nthink i i'm sorry i got a little lost in \nthe details of of when you were \nexplaining it originally uh well you \nshould ask 18 years old \nyeah so basically it's it \nit's really simple from from what we do \num because essentially we still traverse \nthe the entire graph so if you you think \nof the entire graph as being your your \nfull data set um essentially what we do \nis just if you come across \nlet's say there are no restrictions then \nyou come across your your basically your \nexit conditions at some points you know \nthis is my result set \nall we do is basically saying well if \nyou have something that's on your result \nset that's not in our allow list we \nsimply skip it and then that of course \nmeans you need to find something else so \nbasically you keep traversing that that \nthat graph space and and one of the \nreasons why hmsw is efficient in um in \nthe first place is basically because you \ndon't have to traverse the entire graph \nso by basically filtering something \nyou're saying like yes i'm removing or \nnot i'm removing them and you still have \nto traverse them but i'm basically \nignoring i think is the better term \nsome of those some of those elements and \nyeah the the payoff basically is that i \nneed to traverse a couple of more edges \nand find other other verse hall sets \nbut in the end basically you can still \nfind them i think this is the part that \nthat um \nyeah maybe i can't explain so much but \nthat we just tried out and that we were \nsurprised by that the recall was still \nthere that that basically this this um \nyeah integrity is lost \nthe way that we use the inverted index \nbasically \nit's just a tool in front like like once \nwe start traversing the h and sw index \nbasically we just need to know which \nelements do we accept and which we don't \nand we happen to use an inverted index \nbut basically this is this like the \nagent's w graph at that point it doesn't \nknow where the the data came from \nbasically it's just a \nlist of of ids that we allow versus \nlists that we that we skip awesome so \nthere's so much information behind this \nand i think it's extremely interesting \nand i wanted to kind of transition into \nthis topic uh yuri i saw your paper um \ntitled \ncnn with large memory layers and i was \nthinking about memory augmented agents \nand this idea that you can use these \nvector structures to have a really \nmassive memory and i was first \nintroduced to locality sensitive hashing \nin the paper the reformer that was one \nof the first papers presenting an \nefficient transformer model that could \nhave a longer input window than 512 \ntokens so i was wondering if you had any \nthoughts on how we can use these kinds \nof ideas from \nvector indexing into say going beyond \n512 tokens and i was also thinking that \nkind of generally even if you have a \nyou know a slow inference time \nwith say a memory that a model that's \nproducing something like abstractive \nsummarization over scientific literature \nthat you know that kind of trade-off of \nslow inference but for the artifact of \nan abstract of summarization of say \npapers about \nvector indexes would be kind of worth it \nso i was thinking about if you had any \nideas on how you could maybe put h and \nsw into say efficient transformers and \nthat kind of idea \nuh well \num \nso you can you use \nan indices and uh so therefore works i \nthink there was a like lately \ndeep mind \nretro \nand uh before that there were other \npapers uh on uh like supplementing the \nuh neural networks with \ndatabases so i think that is a very \npromising direction \nand uh \nwell that is very similar to graph \nlearning itself so you add some context \nand \nwell you can think of \nthat and an index can provide uh like uh \nlike what what does it provide it \nprovides the nearest neighbor graph \nso and uh like if you \ntreat uh \nlike you have you have a document you \nfind nearest neighbors \nand you put some information and \nin the transformer there you can say \nthat is the typical graph learning is \njust you have an additional input like \nfrom k n graph \nand uh like those approaches like h and \ns w \nthey are also built on graphs \nso uh \nyou can \nyou can just uh use this graph as input \nand hopefully like what i like i would \nhope to see is that the transformers \nwould learn to route on this graph \nso and uh they wouldn't be able to do \na nearest neighbor's charge \nuh like what they actually need because \nwhen you just add nearest neighbors like \nuh like in retro and other there is no \nguarantee that those \nuh \nneighbors are actually the best \ninformation that you can supply uh for \nthe network like for for the neural \nnetwork there might be some elements \naround and if you allow the network to \nroute like select like on which point of \nthe graph you should go \nit it might it might perform better well \nit should perform better like \nmy idea that \nlike nearest neighbors are not very \nmeaningful \nbecause \nsorry \nbecause we can treat the query the query \nvalue the query key value projections \nand attention as kind of like a vector \nsearch also right and we could so we \ncould kind of blow up the size of the \nintermediate query key value matrices \nand then use these vector searches to \nit i think it would slow it down a lot \nbut then you could have \nyou know a lot of information like a \nmixture of experts \nokay okay so uh \nyeah i think i uh \ni know i i understood the question so uh \nyeah you can like uh \ndo something like reformer so reformers \nyou use lsh \nuh well you can use also \nother indices so so here lsa which is \ngood because it is fast so you don't \nneed to build an index \nfor that uh \nbut like maybe \nwell uh \nlike \nwell you would probably want to build an \nindex here because you have a different \ntoken distribution from sample to sample \nso the like an optimal index would be \nalso different i thought there was a \nfollow up uh on this uh \nreformer where there was like clustered \nso instead of lsh there were clusters to \nproject \nwhich is like just a better version of \nlsh \nand there uh \nlike i'm not very sure like where hmsw \ncould fit in \nuh \nbecause uh so you will need to build it \nfirst \nso that's a like an engineering \ntrade-off like whether you should do \nbrutal force \nor \nlike \nso it's no it's not it's not very clear \nso like you can \nso \nbecause it's an engineering \nuh \nit is an engineering problem like in \nmany cases you can't just uh \ngo away like with a go with lsh it will \nbe slower \nuh \nyeah it will be less accurate but if you \nlike increase the size so it might be \nfine uh \nso it is \nit is hard to like to really predict \nwhether it should it it should be used \nthere but uh for the documents i think \nlike uh like if you have lots of \ndocuments and that those are like very \ndifferent \nand uh they can reside so they don't \nchange over time so you can pre-build an \nindex for them like \na graph so that that would make much \nmore sense \nyeah i guess i was thinking about kind \nof uh like these contrastive learning \nmethods where you have maybe an \nexponential moving average of one copy \nof the weights and maybe you would cache \nthat and build up the index of those \nactivations maybe some kind of pipeline \nlike that and then i was also well uh \nyeah \nsorry so uh \nlike when you do contrastive learning uh \nso usually the nearest neighbor search \nlike unless you have like a really huge \ndata \nlike really huge data set is very fast \nbecause you do it on gpu \nand uh like you can easily search like \nwithin \ni don't know 10 million vectors like \nwhat what is the the closest uh \nelements because transformers or other \nnetworks that are run to produce the \nloader much slower \nso uh there i don't think like \nyou should use them but \nuh if you want to go like to billion \nscale \nso like you have like a cache and uh \nthat that that that would be a \nuh that would be meaningful \nhave you ever thought about using this \nthese vector search algorithms to search \nfor similar activation pathways in very \nlarge neural networks \noh well yes i did so it's a like very \nhandy techniques to find \nlike the problems with data sets so like \nlike for images for instance if you have \nuh \nlike \nif you if you have some like badly \nclassified example so you can look for \nsimilar activations in the data set \nso and uh \nyeah i used that for cleaning data sets \nsome some time ago and uh yeah but that \nthat that usually works \nat least for images \nyeah i love that application of wev8 as \na tool for uh doing de-duplication of \nsay language modeling data and and uh \nthey have the uh the merge variable as \nno eddie knows all about that will merge \nthe nearby things and i love that \napplication of it for um \nfor d uh data deduplication so um one \nkind of meta question i wanted to ask is \nabout um you know billion scale \nsimilarities surge just to build more \nintuition could you tell us about uh \nlike the application of billion scale \nsearch that inspires you and \nyou know keeps you working on these \nproblems well uh \nso there are many applications like i \nnow work in twitter \nso and twitter there are \nlike billions of uh tweets that you can \nshow to user \nuh like if you are doing out of network \nuh \nlike candidates \nso \nthe other \nthere are papers so well there are like \nalso \nuh like \nwell \nthere are also text \nso like uh \nif you want to build a really huge \nlanguage model so right now you can use \na lot of text and uh like also like i \ncan \nuh mention \nthe like they give my paper \nso uh like it depends on a n and uh like \nlike \ni can easily imagine billion scale there \nso we have like a billion \nbillion documents so that is like web \nscale \nwell even like less than web scale i \nthink last web scale is uh like \n10 to 15 \nelements like or more \nokay cool cool eddie do you have \nanything to um \nwrap it up with no other than to to say \nthank you very much this is really \ninsightful and i mean it's it's always \nnice to to hear the the minds and that's \nbehind these kind of algorithms that you \nknow but it's also so cool to yeah get \nthis this additional insight of both \nsort of in both directions like both in \nthe history of what happened before and \ni mean i knew that agents w was based on \nnsw but basically that's where where my \nhistory part ended and and yes you made \nas you told us there's there's it's \nbuilding on so much more and of course \nalways research is building up on other \nrace version this is just very cool to \nsee how this these things come together \num that we are here at this point and \nand also with the same in the other \ndirection to see what's still possible \nlike uh potential integrations of \nsomething like like product quantization \ninto into hmsw and yeah all these these \nother kind of things so um \nsuper cool very very insightful for us i \nhope it was also interesting for the for \nour listeners when we when we go very \ndeep into those topics but i i enjoyed \nit very much so thank you for my side \nyeah thank you that was uh \nenjoy like and a nice like an enjoyable \ntalk to me as well \nso \nyeah thank you thank you \nthank you so much eddie and yuri and to \nour listeners yeah such a master class \nin the depth of these topics and you \nknow i'm really impressed with how much \nyou guys have explored these vector \nindexing techniques and i'm excited to \nbe learning more about it as well so \nthank you so much for watching the \neighth episode of the we vva podcast \nmore to come on you know developing our \nunderstanding of vector indexing and \nthese things that are available in wevg8 \nwhich i think is such an exciting part \nof we've eight that you can't overlook \nis the implementation of these vector \nindexes that let you do very large scale \nsimilarity searches \n[Music] \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Podcast #10 - Yury Malkov and Etienne Dilocker about HNSW in Vector Search and
