{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the 78th episode of the Weaviate podcast featuring Rudy Lai, the founder and ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for watching the weeva podcast I'm super excited to welcome Rudy lie the CEO and co-founder of tactic the creators behind tactic generate we recently had Charles Pierce on the wva podcast to discuss tactic generate and I was so excited that Rudy wanted to come on the podcast as well and continue explaining this story because I think this is just so exciting this uh user experience design around chat with your documents and I think this kind of specific narrowing of the focus of you upload say you know 5 to 10 documents and you have this kind of uh tabular view of how you ask questions on each of the documents I think there's so much to explore in this and understanding the emerging space of the different kinds of user experiences people are building around these new technologies so before going any further Rudy thank you so much for joining the podcast thanks for having me Connor awesome so could we kick it off with kind of the research that took tactic did tactic generate yeah for sure so um we started tactic or working on tactic about four years years ago and our it's leral in our pitch deck so our mission has always been to find a way to automate finding and summarizing information right because we believe that that's a core part of knowledge work and knowledge work is growing and exploding as a need in an economy and a lot of knowledge work gos down to finding the right facts um in in various information sources documents being a big part of it uh and then and analyzing it summarizing it and then kind of Pres presting in a in a useful format for the next person so it's almost like knowledge pipeline it goes from one person to the next person and teams and and and organizations and whatnot but fundamentally it's all kind of taking data from one place applying analysis and then going going forward so what really took tactic to tactic generate is we we've really been this is like a natural extension of of this Vision right because when we started uh GPT was around but it was gpd1 or maybe even before that um the the kind of predominant model then was the ones from Allen Institute was I think BT just came out um so it wasn't very powerful back then like were R based natural language generation systems that mainly were used for train stations and wther reports but nothing fancy like we have today right um and the the kind of I guess technical difficulty was was was not a obstacle for us and if anything it made it more attractive to to pursue this startup um we found a lot of traction in the Enterprise space and one of the things that uh worked for us was sort of large scale uh data creation right or or data synthesis where kind of it was like small bits of data that you can find and summarize a bit like a search at scale kind of kind of solution um but we always ran into customers where they had a lot more complicated complex needs around um the the the kind of facts that they're finding the analysis that they're doing and the summarization that they're doing especially around uh kind of asking questions about increasingly complicated documents and also producing increasingly complicated and sophisticated reporting and anization and Analysis so that's that's where we were so we we were looking at this this problem for the longest time right like we know where it is we know what tool are out there we know why they suck we know why they not suck we know what what needs to happen for this to to work um and I think critically we we knew that the I guess the summarization and Analysis is just one part of the magic right there's a lot of it is around the the user experience integration the pricing and all that kind of stuff um that affected it so at the turn of this year as you know like that the world exploded with with ch GPT and I I think the then then we were like okay well what can this like how does this change where we are on the Innovation kind of curve right um because this kind of to us signified it's the time for us to rethink how do we solve this problem that we know very deeply um and so tactic generate was sort of like our stab edit where we kind of saw uh a few needs right number one is if you kind of think from the end the one of the key requirements for like really any knowledge worker that we we speak to is the flexibility of the visualization right how what's the report that you designing how how do you how do you um structure it how do you like make it pretty how do you make it digestible digestible is actually like a big word that people use a lot so that's number one right like what does it look like and then number two is we then thought okay well it's probably not that interesting to build a tool that I guess takes a small bit of data extracts some answers and then like visualizes it right because you can do that by hand you don't even need GPT and if there's anything longer you can probably copy and paste it into um into into like a chat or into like a like a AI to and then you're done so that's that's probably not where it it's worth spending time time so our natural kind of idea was well what is the most complicated but replicable use case and that's where the comparison stuff came in because while you can reasonably say you can kind of paste in 600 pages of a PDF into cat GPT um if you have two then that no matter how big your context it's it's just it's not clear-cut enough for it to do any sort of useful analysis so that's number two number three it's we wanted to look at we want to solve the problem of repeated analysis for a lot of our users so whether we look in the legal field for lawyers uh Financial Feud for investment analysts uh Enterprise Feud for uh kind of customer facing data teams and research teams a lot of the times they they literally have this thing called a knowledge pipeline where they are creating knowledge and creating Insight um in a repeatable way so one example it's customer onboarding right like every time you onboard a customer you need to find and sumarize who this customer is and how it fits with your business model give it a score and then put in somewhere else um every time you on board a new vendor the legal team has to go through the t's and C's to make sure that the payment terms are fine the the legality of it is fine the the liability is what kind of appropriately placed and there's we have seen literally hundreds of playbooks around somebody uh unlike you and I like sitting down just writing down like okay guys this is our process right we get a new vendor in in we look at these five documents we ask these set of questions and basically if the answers are this then assign this score the this score and we were like well that's a machine learning algorithm it's just before kind of all this large language models came on like there was no there's no way for you to automate this so the the kind of three things is really pretty reports um kind of comparison and complicated analysis and then a repeatable use case right so in the backdrop of these three problems we designed tactic generate yeah Rudy that was fantastic overview so much so much in that to unpack and I think um yeah I kind of want to I think I want to end kind of on this on the pretty reports part because I do I think that's quite profound and but kind of staying on the the chat the the looking across multiple documents I really like this perspective like I guess before uh you know I just listen to your overview I was I was maybe mostly thinking about I upload like 10 research papers and I ask a question like uh you know what uh I don't know how does this use retrieval augmented generation I don't know and it asks it across each of the questions and I aggregated it but this also like kind of um you know putting in customers or recent projects and trying to like you know process multiple I don't I guess like almost like people in a way like this kind of because this like CRM like is like do this analysis across all these people and it's yeah it's also kind of mind openening and so I guess kind of if we could dig a little further into the kind of workflows you earlier when we talked you described this kind of looking for the VIN diagram of commonality between say researchers equities researchers or maybe a lawyer and I think also this kind of how you've described looking across customers is also sort of it already kind of expanded the scope but just that perspective of how do you go about trying to identify the common workflows between these you know massively different kind of I want to say like information professions yeah so um the kind of Ven diagram idea that we we talked about it's really I guess a mindset of how we're looking to build this product um the the main thing is we think this is a pretty horizontal uh platform or product that we're building that maybe has a few key use cases or killer use cases that we Market but fundament mentally like it's it it has to cross a few personas for it to suceed um I think the backdrop it's with quite High Ambitions for the audience of of this tool um we want it to be as as applicable to everybody as possible um so I think one of the the main kind of challenges in building a product like this is how how do you prioritize like how do you focus because if your I guess objective is to make it work for most people at least at multiple kind of personas by definition you don't have Focus right because you you're declaring that like actually multiple kind of kinds of people who use this so the way that we kind of reasoned about this or or worked around this philosophically is to say well our thesis about building this this this product is like any other horizontal product right like what is the intersection between the workflows of these people and like how do we build the common bits out and find a way to for these users to customize it to their needs and and their workflows but still build out the core and our theory is if we solve the core really well for a lot of um personas it actually delivers more value because it simplifies the solution it simplifies the problem for everybody and like there cross pollination of like what the solution needs to look like so literally it's it's just us going the oldfashioned way user Journey Maps us experience diagrams we kind of draw out like what what what are people doing across these seemingly unrelated um workflows how can we rethink them relabel them um to to find commonalities between the different kind of steps so to say and then where we get to the where we find like a step that's kind of end to endend and and and common so the the the intersection in the v diagram then that that's where our focus is so it still gives us a focus but it means that if we're really good at this intersection there'll be a big audience behind what we're focused on versus if you are defining focus in an arbitrary way like oh let's make TX generate but let's make it great for pharmaceutical scientists first like that sounds like a great Focus but what you end up is is you spend a lot of time building for a very small audience which really limits the impact uh of your platform so that's that's kind of how we think about and then prioritization and focus for tactic generate yeah I think that's so interesting I I guess like personally I had this perspective of wanting to build something for AI researchers because I think of myself as an AI researcher and then I feel like I can understand that market and I think it would be really interesting for people listening who are also trying to like build their apps to understand this like I'm very curious like how you spend your time sort of in doing so like like do you have maybe like a you know a customer like a lawyer a research scientist and you know and a salesperson and you kind of like work with each of them closely and then you try to you know refactor out the abstractions like like how how do you kind of go about doing this research of like what each person does and just sort of like what like kind of concretely what does the uh the task of building that product and managing those relationships and you know yeah so I think this is the Rel related to the concept um called founder market fit uh which kind of states that you should find an idea that suits your skill set and your experience um I come from a a world of Professional Services a lot of my friends in network are in law research Information Services science um knowledge jobs basically and so I think for me it's less about um finding and maintaining these relationships but more like exploiting what I already know um and what I've done before like I was the guy who was building these knowledge pipelines for when I went in the first three five five years of my career and I've like struggled with them quite a bit and and nothing replaces that kind of experience and and that's precisely the reason why I'm not in Agri Tech or I'm not in uh like transport Tech or whatever it is because I don't know what to start like I know I know nobody who is working in City Planning or I know nobody who's working in farming um and and so so that's one thing the other thing it's like it's I I think the whole art of building a product is around research and and and talking to customers and and whether it's about talking to customers about similar tools talking to customers about competitive tools talking to customers about their problem and how it ranks in their stack there's like you just can't stop learning and and there's no amount like there's an infinite amount of insight out there for you um and it's definitely something you can't like maybe this is sort of my my idiosyncratic term you can't armchair uh and and and and think of a successful product um it's it's it's a constant cycle of um kind of testing and learning so I think in terms of concrete actionable steps for for people who are building products I think number one is to go talk to your audience like if you can't explain it easily what you're doing and and make them resonate uh with what you're building it probably wouldn't work right because at some point you the the rubber needs to hit the road and the rubber doesn't hit the road without marketing so you need to first like be very intimate with your audience and and talk to them the second thing that we've learned it's you need to form full hypotheses to test with this audience right so you get a lot of insight you understand like for example what AI s need um one of the dangers is to solve a bit of it or to test something that's too insignificant where because it doesn't matter like nobody gives you real feedback whereas if you like the whole art of like kind of finding a new product is how do you um I guess test the most amount of assumption with the least amount of effort right so like what what you want to do is like after you get the Insight you want to say what if I try this big idea right like how fast can I der risk this big idea and put it in front of people now when you talk about Big Ideas because it matters then people are going to be a lot more critical and they have like a lot more actionable feedback to give you right so I can give a very concrete example um I think some people are like oh let me te let me try to accelerate AI research um what if I test a tool that sends you new papers on archive every morning right like a little email we've all thought it like we've all thought about that one and it's some time and this is fine and and but then the the kind of feedback you're going to get at it it's it's proportional to the the impacts that that or the ambition of your pro problem whereas if you go go to somebody and say hey Connor can you still do your job if you're if you're not allowed to go on archive you have to go through this tool then you know that to needs to be really good because it it's life is like a significant part of your job right and and you have significant requirements because you can't not have archive in your in your row like that just that's Unthinkable um and so I think that's that's where like having a real big test in the market is very important and then lastly it's just a good way of what I've heard it's sort of when you're finding new products is always around strong strong beliefs weakly held or or strong strong kind of convictions weakly held where you want to really believe in something and it's challenging mindset to adop right but you one really believe in something like oh I really believe that I can replace archive I have a better archive than than before um but then you you want to test it quickly and you want to kind of like see the evidence of the point where you then like actually maybe I'm wrong and then you just be like yeah whatever not not whatever but like you need to kind of make that switch from I really believe in it to like actually there's enough evidence to say that probably wouldn't work and like oh well and let's move on to to kind of like get that Innovation Pace going rather than obsessing about being right and Visionary because like nobody's like Thomas Edison was a Visionary he just tried enough materials and then he was a Visionary um so um so I think those are the kind of three steps that we went through yeah I think there's a lot of super interesting kind of philosophy in that I think um yeah that kind of testing ideas in the market so to say it's it's really fascinating I think like um maybe making the analog to Vector databases in the state that that's all in right now is there's kind of like there's kind of like this the the rag stuff and kind of like higher level query interfaces are so popular it's so quick to um see how much people like something like an SQL router or a multihop question decomposition thing whereas I I think then if you want to look into like different kinds of indexes within deep into the database it's like I think there's also this interesting interplay between like a big idea that you kind of preview like you say hey this is something that we could do but like you know it's G to take a while but you still kind of like put it out there and then kind of like build up like a you know the momentum for it and I yeah I think especially with technology it's such a kind of hard to just kind of nail down and describe that process but I do I I'm really fascinating this kind of um like how manage talking to customers and maybe that's something we can come back to after we kind of dive a little more into tactic Genera so so let's dive into it this kind of like comparison across multiple documents I think that is a super powerful thing it's like you know we we all kind of know this like chat with documents where you know you you just kind of retrieve augment to generate and you have some input that's like from your documents compared to this other kind of perspective that you're pioneering which is like uh answer for each of the documents and then kind of analyze it later can you just kind of tell me further about the conviction that you said this kind of ask a question across each individual document that's that's a super powerful way to interface with these chat Bots I think the the the reason why we we're we believeing in so much it's we we have always I think it comes from our experience working with this sort of user experience for the long time and I want to stress that the reason why we talk about user experience a lot is because we think all of AI comes back to user experience where like you could mean we all do like whether you you score a benchmark at 85 F1 or 92 like it matters but what what really matters it's like what the impact you going deliver as as a as a as a model so the in in terms of the conviction around the comparison I think the there are a few things that make us quite excited right so number one is the comparison enable us to kind of easily extend into the idea of Agents um the second thing that's interesting for us it's it's a good combination of sort of Old World ruse based kind of Knowledge Management systems and new world like GPT llm based uh vector-based kind of Knowledge Management um and the reason why these two things are important it's number one so they're they're kind of both based on the learning that we've seen in the field so the reason why kind of comparing different like topics and and maybe we haven't talked about this in tactic generate you can compare across documents but you can also compare called folders so you can say like I have five folders one per vendor and then within each folder I have multiple documents and multiple databases and multiple like Excel files that's fine like the comparison and bucketing is is what what makes it powerful um so I think the the reason why this is this is the bet that we made it's it's not because like as as it is it's it's a world changing idea like I don't think it's anywhere near that but it's like a Gateway for us to get to a lot more exciting kind of long-term prospects because if the idea of comparison works and if the idea of like having different buckets of of of documents going into uh LMS will work um that means you can then kind of like naturally hook into existing knowledge graphs that are present in in everyday life and it means that like there's a way for us to go beyond just chatting to docs right because as you know uploading and PDF and chatting to it it's it's still 2023 January you know than that nowadays and um and so that's that's number one and then number two like the we've always seen that the the kind of main downside of AI it's the blackbox nness of it right like um if we kind of think back to pre 20107 before deep learning like explainability was a giant thing right everybody was like oh my God I have like explainable AI you can see all of it um and and kind of see NN came to play and everybody was like oh my God I can generate cats now um get explain ability and they kind of came back for a bit and LMS came in and then people were obsessed about generating travel plans on on chat GPT and then they forgot about it um but what we think what we' seen is actually users don't really care about explainability as much as they care about control right so the the the the reason why people want something explainable is not because they want to know what's happening they don't want to knows what happening they want to know how to fix things when it doesn't work um and I think the the kind of comparison enables us to give a very simple analogy to a user to say hey here's how you can control the inputs to an LM who's how to control inputs to rag um and and you they're familiar things that you can use like folders and and tags and and documents to control something that's so new age and so black boxy like a like a like a rack system um and that's why I think we we've invested so much in confidence into this idea yeah I love how you just also opened my perspective about the folders talk across folder already about kind of putting in people and I was also kind of starting to think about like well what if one of the columns is querying like an SQL table or yeah and like you could have the same kind of U you know it could be Vector search across uh like multiple collections in the you know when you separate out and table collections being kind of the you know the analog to that but yeah I I just think this kind of user interface thing is so powerful I think chat gbt you know a big part of its success is that it has this GUI that is very available like if it was a model on hugging face I don't think my mom I don't think my mom would know about it right you're gonna get a phone call from clam soon um I agreed it's it's the because GPT has always existed right the the explosiveness was the chat part of it um so yeah AB you're absolutely right yeah and I you know talking to entrepreneur I think like um also a really interesting one is perplexity from rine and trinos the founder of it and uh like this is like uh chatbot but as well as the attribution to sources so you kind of have the interface where it gives you like here are the documents that this answer is based on and uh you know our last the podcast we just published with um vibs from no plus you know it's like a a a user experience with visuals for how you manage like multiple assist assistants or agents so I I do think the impact of this kind of user interface design with this columns I I think it can it is like you know I do think it's world changing as you said I don't think it's world changing but I really think it can it it can have that potential to kind of like this is kind of the the big exciting thing I want to kind of bring up is like Andre karpathy had this really famous tweet comparing llms to operating systems where he said right now we're in like the 10 Hertz per second like tokens per second analog where we're like watching single-threaded execu we're just kind of watching the single-threaded execution and I think this is the next step is um you know like where we have these visualizations of llm parallelization I want to call it like where you see it processing kind of like four folders documents at a time and so I think it's that next step in the visualization maybe like if you could tell me more about your perspectives and like yeah I guess just that like visualization of LM prompt chains because it's like now what we're finding is the LM is like an atomic processing unit and we can just like chain it together have it process documents asynchronously and that's kind of what I what I'm picturing this all is like yeah yeah the way I I'm actually and this this might be a this is purely opinion I I've lots of lots of respect for people who are working on promp chains but I think it it needs a needs a repositioning on in terms of marketing language right because I think the word chaining and Chain of Thought chain of command whatever you want to you want to say and and the kind of prompts like all of these are I guess quite technical right like I I have the same problem with the word temperature right like of all the words to take to describe this knob like why why would you call it temperature um because it's like it's not technical because if it's technical it be entropy or something um and but it's not like fully kind of plain English either um but anyway um I think in terms of kind of prompts like my view is I I I'm I'm very much on the same page as as as as Andre where I think we are we're seeing like a new way to program right because like if if you if you think about like a programming language which is uh the the kind of opposite of a of a natural language um it's a way for you to communicate with the computer um and and get it to do things right and and what is like an LM it's a way to communicate with computer to get it to do things except the the Silicon is the model right like if if you think about the the way the neurons are laid out it it's you can kind of say that it's it's a it's a piece of Hardware right um because information travels through and it comes out and and you have all this logic going in uh in the middle and it's just that instead of having binary Gates it's sort of a a continuous gate in every in every in every transistor um so I definitely think we are in the kind of 10 Hertz or even slower kind of kind of um I definitely think it is a computer like I'm sure somebody a lot more computer sciencey can can can give a lot more science around that but what I see from a practical standpoint is I can imagine that there is a little bit of a in between between programming languages and like fully chatty natural language uh implementations where it's the middle ground of you just have like a load of prompts that go go on and on and there's like defined um structure between the prompts and so it lowers the bar for uh programming and actually that's a really good thing because I think our profession is going to expand not contract in the next 10 20 30 50 years and it's actually incredibly important for us as a society to have more and more program there more more people knowing how to program and if we can lower the bar for this it actually democratizes and then and and creates a lot more opportunity for us as a whole um I think the difficult thing is all the things we've been talking about right the specificity of of of llms the the predictability like how Britto is it versus um the the the training model because like for example if you're building a compiler you can change one bit and you can clearly State what bit you have changed you issue a new compiler and that's it that's that like there's no more to it whereas with natural language you can't do that right you can't just say hey I just changed this particular thing and like people understand it like there's a schema for it there's none of these things so um to to quote another kind of big Tech influencer um I believe it's Ben Evans who said like programming with LMS is like playing Battleship you put in an input and you see what happens right you don't know you see what happens and sometimes you strike gold and I think that needs to kind of find a balance before it's useful and I think before that the kind of prompt chains or or or uh change of thought kind of Implement uh I guess approach would kind of purely be in the very technical realm where you're you you're almost kind of half an AI researcher or you're prompt engineer so to say and it's extremely Technical and like we we know you know the simpler idea the faster it spreads so that's sort of My overall kind of thoughts around this yeah I think there's so much to unpack to that the last thing you said it's the simpler the idea the easier it spreads I think I I want to stay on that one I like it so so much because it's like yeah I feel like with um with Chain of Thought well I guess that's the thing is like if these visualizations and user interfaces can simplify it for you know some PE someone who I don't know like maybe you're like a teacher in the fifth grade and you want to use rag to you have all your students's tests and you want to try to find com like things like this like like the user interface the way that it can make it you know more accessible compared to yeah like I like I I don't I don't know if the fifth grade teacher is going to be you know trying to write this in Python with Lang chain but I think rather having something like tactic generated is more so what they would want would be my guess but so I I kind of want to talk staying on this user interface this is really the topic I really want to drive into is I'm very curious about like aggregating the analysis across the document so say I have my three folders I I even I already like folders more than documents but like so I have my three folders and um I've asked a question like uh I don't know what do you think about Guerilla llms and I have three folders of research papers and they each like produce a question and then say I want to sync it up so like maybe I I then have like a row where I'm like okay now talk to the other columns and and unify it and I think this this is related to the pretty reports kind of idea right so how would you think about then kind of merging The Columns together really good question and I think that's where all the value is in in a in a tool like this because um I think to just kind of stay focused on the problems that we're trying to solve as as technologists um you you and I both know that if you find a 100 fifth grade teachers one of them would know Python and would be on L chain the other 99 would not um so how do you how do you get it the other 99 to benefit from from this progress um it's still very early days but like the the kind of useful analogy I found in in the word of tech is business intelligence tools so guys like looker guys like um mode guys like to blow um and and kind of if you break these kind of products down they all kind of have a thing in common where there is a retrieval step and then there's a visualization step to give you a very simple example in these tools what you can do is you can connect your business data um or you can connect your personal data like if you're a Quantified Self kind of app and connect this data and then you write a query right like you're like SQL query you're like hey give me the sales by quarter for the last eight quarters and you have that and you have this like big kind of table that is an eyesore right it's hard to look at these numbers they're often like with loads of decimal points and so on so forth and and then so these TOS give you then a way to chart these guys up right and we all know this like you take the table you make a bar bar chart you make a line chart you make a pie chart whatever um and so I think this is like a really good analogy um for I think what's about to come in the in the kind of llm UI space where the llm is sort of a new age information retrieval or or or yeah kind of language right so that is SQL in the in for unstructured and and and Text data and and now really any unstructured data right text video audio um documents and and so I think we can we can kind of arrive at a step in the in the in the in the next 18 months where um you have all these tools which allow you to extract specialized types of data into a format that people somewhat are familiar with like a table or like a report or something and then there's another bit that visualizes this right so I think I can go so so far to say as it probably will be the same visualizations that we already know like charts graphs diagrams I would say that maybe we would see like a gig plot mer kind of meets McKenzie slides kind of mod where like in in Gig plot you have I don't know 25 different plot types and and it's all popularized and then in in this new kind of Library you would have uh 25 most common ways to visualize denser information right unstructured information so you can imagine like a few paragraphs and a few kind of like a graph and it just kind of like merges the whole thing and tells a pretty story and then maybe what would happen is like you would have one bit where you're like I'm looking for this kind of data and another bit where I want to summarize it this way and then in the summarizing bit you would have a fine-tune model that could spit out these visualizations or or or slides and it's not a new idea right like to is doing a great job at at creating these generative slides um and so I think that's that's that's the that that's currently the way that we see it's most possible to go towards um the other way that I think UI could be like really really impactful in in this instead of companies like ourselves or or I guess instead of horizontal products let's say in general um seeing traction you actually first see the vertical tool seeing traction H right so um you would have a exam prepare preparation app or you have like a quiz creation app that starts integrating this right but the the the main fine-tuning that they're all doing it's sort of text to action right how can you go from prompt to whatever action that you need to perform in that in that app to create the end resell um and I think because it's so shap what what LMS can do really anchoring this in this kind of extreme way leveraging fine tuning leveraging Chain of Thought leveraging rag will mean that the learning curve for the user is the smallest and you know according to one of the the ux kind of principles I think it's yakov's law um where users spend most time outside of your app not with your app like making a familiar experience goes a long way in making sure that adoption happens for some of these new groundbreaking Technologies hm yeah well so there so again just so much it inspired so many ideas for me like the I guess just the thinking of like creating a presentation is is super powerful like I think about like recently I was reading the mgbt paper and I'm like going through it I might ask questions to particular paragraphs and I create this like artifact of the questions I've asked and especially as the models get multimodal and they can extract a picture and maybe look at a picture or even create create a picture and I think they can just use apis to create graphs I don't think you'll need to have it the image generation model to create a graph but but anyway so like this this kind of idea of creating this artifact it I guess for me it then is like um the tuning of the artifact so like if I I guess like if if I have this like I chat with my paper and I ask it these questions and I you know and it should be able to understand from the questions I asked to the paper kind of how I see the story uniquely and what kind of presentation I'd want to produce when then want to go you know tell Rudy about mgpt so but I'm curious like if there's maybe like I don't know if I'm getting to off the rails and into the clouds with this one but this kind of like multi-agent thing is emerging as a as a new as a new kind of thing like autogen is getting really popular in like role playing systems where it's like uh you know someone who would maybe inter impersonate Conor impersonate Rudy impersonate Bob let's say he's in our you know our fic world so I'm curious if I know that this is May pivoting the topic from the kind of presentation but this whole kind of like multi-agent thing does that maybe have something to do with this sort of visualization interface where I I could imagine like multiple columns are like you know the Connor column the Rudy column the Bob column right and then they each process something and I can visualize it with this kind of user interface perspective uh maybe I think the there is there is the the question about can it be done and then there's a question about is it useful um and I think the for me the value of the multi-agent thing is at least from my perspective and I have a very kind of I guess business perspective around it um is you can ultimate more and more compli at processes right because that's that's that's the obsession of tactic as a company um and and so it's probably more around um using that idea to represent different types of experts and different types of underlying data and business business needs and objectives and how they interact rather than the visualization of it and and I'm I'm guessing I I can probably dig a lot deeper into aogen to to to get this question in more precise way but I I think what what it is it's maybe I can answer it this way so the reason why I answered the I gave the previous answer was ultimately the visualization is a means to an end right like the end as you say it's like you presenting this deck about mgpt in in the in the podcast you did or in the video you did sorry I think yesterday um and uh and and so kind of I think the the exciting part about these multi-agent systems is the ability for a developer to offer automations that are more powerful than than than what we have now that allows you to skip even more steps about building this this this presentation right maybe like I'm just a farf thing it's maybe you can like describe something and then the video comes out right and then you're like okay like this is a good first draft why don't I why don't I um why don't I modify this and and because we we have crack this balance between structured and unstructured kind of outputs like you have levers to change the output and and and and and the Machine has created something that's workable rather than um just creating I think this is where we are now with video generation where it creates a video and that that's kind of it like there's no levers you can't like remove a tiger or whatever like have to just say like hey I like this can you generate again and hopefully the tiger stays there um whereas I think with with multi-agent like it means that we can kind of in I guess compose more and more pieces of context into one thing and then have it all interact together in a correct way um that's my current view about how this works but I like my push back about whether visualizing the different agents would would be interesting is because I think it would more be like a beneath the surface kind of intelligence layer thing rather because because visualization is not the end goal um and therefore like it would yeah it wouldn't be the first thing I try let's say but who knows I haven't tried it yet so yeah yeah I mean I just think it's really interesting because I'm I'm so obsessed with this column like user interfaces is just like you know my focus for the last 45 minutes as we're talking is like just and I and I it's originally what we're talking about with the customer kind of perspective like I I could imagine like um you know I have a new I've written a new blog post and I have like 50 people who I really would like to know what they think about the blog post and then it is kind of simulated through maybe like a you know like a um a horizontally I can just scroll horizontally and see like Bob Eddie and Byron like see everyone yes so I I and so I guess the other question and this is kind of what came from you know thinking about how to optimize the reports is I'm very curious what like a more autonomous research across your documents could look like like we we see things like you can use the LM to maybe propose a question for a document like the LMS can kind of come up with their own questions and then sort of answer it as well so do you think a lot about this kind of more autonom research process yeah I think I mean I think the the kind of current challenge that we we all have as an industry is how unbounded and how Limitless the the possibilities are right it's I think the way I I I I sometimes like iess think about it to with myself it's this conversation is like you and I like if you substitute the word AI with the word python you would understand like how I guess unbounded the question is like oh can we can we make this with python probably um but the the way I I specifically think about it in terms of um div visualization is um let me pick up my train of thoughts for for few seconds um yeah so in terms of generating the end result and generating questions I think we can be a lot more ambitious than that right so I think in terms of automation the way I I like to De compose it it's I think we have an opportunity here to kind of alterate the usage of certain or or usage of apps essentially right and I can expand on that so let's take the simple example first right let let's think about building a report right let's say think about building a summarized short report from a very long piece of piece of document so let's say we took the 2023 llm paper review on archive which is I think 60 pages long and want to produce like a blog post that says like hey these are the key themes and this blog post needs to be five minutes long let's say a reading time um if if we don't have LMS then what we'll do is we'll run this through we'll probably pick out the important piece of information and it's like appears in your word document you look at the word document you oh okay so I can cluster this into different areas and I can kind of condense it I'm done um and then after that you you do that and then you start formatting it right so you you're like okay I need to format this um into headings into subheadings and you have like sensible copy I going have to like change the tone a bit add some images like add some stats to make it look pretty and I need to like publish it on my my favorite blog editor right great um the benefit for us it's like a lot of these tools now apis right like you can if you if you publish a blog post uh online you chances are it's some sort of Json blob flying somewhere going in there so I think what we can where we can get to it's like there's really to me no mystery whether you can generate a report not like that's given but what I think would be really cool and this is actually what we're working on is to generate that Json blob that results in a full blog post on your blog um immediately right because you can teach and fine-tune an nlm to understand the schema of the API that you're using to publish this content and just say based on this and based on like successful block post you've seen run like build me a 10 themes from the this this this document for me and it just does the whole thing and I think that's where like your kind of multi-agent thing comes in where you have this panel of experts essentially and one guy is an expert on the the API to published the blog post another agent is an expert on building visualizations the third person is an expert on finding relevant images on unsplash and then a fourth person is is great at like copyrighting and then so they all kind of come together and they just generate this um and I think that's where kind of like the the challenge is um maybe I'm Optimist but like I actually I I don't even think that is that that that hard because to me like we have got to the point where uh with enough resources you can kind of f in the LM to do like most reasonable things and you can get to like a pretty good level of like I'm generating structured content um based on some prompts and then the the LA the next thing for to do is for humans to go tune it and adjust it and add your own twist and then you're you're done so what it looks like it's you're running an IPO deal and you can just say okay let's let's make a deck for the Road show and it just it it calls the Google Sheets slides API nobody needs to stay late to align boxes anymore nobody needs to like have typ post it's all kind of perfect um but you would need so much intelligence in it right like as I said you need somebody who's good at graphs you need an agent who's good at text you need an agent who can think through layout and all these things and I think that's where a lot of the the kind of future uh value is going to be built because I really think generating questions is it's again like a not a solve problem but we have enough evidence that it's doable um whereas I think we kind of stepping out of the can we do it kind of RAM and stepping into the is it valuable kind of kind of ram right like for the longest time can we run um can we run like large neuron networks was big question right like physically it wasn't possible and it was possible and then so the the real impact for application was C GPT and and llms um so uh for me like what excites me is things that are not certain um and to me like generating questions one after the other or like sensible list of questions is like fairly well solved uh especially with rag right like if it's just a common sense kind of thing I understand that's harder like I've triy these tools where they're like oh I generate a blog post for you and it's it's try to approach it in a common sense way I think that's quite hard but if you like break it down and and go through a multi-agent process and each agent is really good at what they're doing then like I don't see why you wouldn't be able to build that it's just a matter of time and resources and effort yeah I think there's I I love again a really great overview of these things and I guess like for me it's like right when Chad gbt came out somebody's like oh I just I I just prompted it with you are Yan laon like AI expert right and then you get a better answer as a result of that and I just think that kind of like author editor role playing is just a super powerful prompt but for whatever reason I mean I still haven't I I don't use that kind of thing every like for every blog post I write I should be putting it into some app that has all these different roles of like you know you're a Harvard admissions counselor does this pass or like you're my boss like so it's like it should be I I just feel like that kind of roleplay I think it's like with laying chain had this like laying Hub I think it's called I I'm not actually super familiar about these things but like one of the uh aspects of like community building around prompting that I think was so powerful is just kind of like you know building up the Corpus of like here are the prompts that people are using and then that kind of roleplaying thing for the author editor thing I think that's so powerful yeah it's really inspiring and I just think that this sort of maybe I'm just obsessed with the I think the column layout of it is just a really nice abstraction for going beyond that single threaded L execution as Andre karpathy describes and getting into this more parallel llm more asynchronous more autonomous and yes so Rudy let me ask you wrapping up the podcast like um what kind of future Direction what what Horizon thing that excites you the most about uh direction of AI I think the the next step for us that's exciting is to find all the real applications that that that that this could bring so I think and then I think what I'm commenting on it's it's not I'm not commenting on like other disciplines of AI right like computer vision can have a break through tomorrow and like we all look like idiots today or like robotics or something um I'm not coming on that I'm just specifically saying like within the kind of developments of GPT and llm and NLP in general I think one of the things that's have been circulating around the industry like I hear it in in corridors of of conferences it's there's like a bit of a soat moment for llms where okay you could chat to it it could generate all this language like okay and then like kind of C customers expectations have have kind of long departed from from from the wow moment um and I think the what we currently see it's it's probably you would see more and more specialized tools that are based on AI that goes beyond oh there's this chat interface or we can summarize things for you or we can we can generate like simple things and it needs to be surprising and it needs to be easy and needs to be intuitive for the end user and I think that's where we we we we see the next chapter of of this this journey but I think right now like as it stands everybody adding summarization everybody's adding chat everybody's adding smarter questions for their data and it doesn't seem like it's moving the needo over anybody else like um is it and and and that's why I think we focus so much on the ux and the UI because like I think that that ultimately kind of governs how how good uh and or how big of an adoption we'll see as an industry um but look I think the the main thing it's uh nothing grows as fast as as AI does like you know you you you rarely see like a like a category that kind of Peaks again and again like you you look at other types of Robotics or crypto or VR they're all kind of like there's a bit of not a bit of a ceiling but like they they don't they're not as fast as this right so I think it's a very exciting time and but I think we we we need to kind of I guess get to the specifics of what can AI really do for us Beyond fun cosmetic things on top of existing existing I guess incumbent Solutions yeah Rudy amazing thank you so much for joining the podcast I I hope our listeners check out tactic generate because I yeah as I think we just discussed for the last hour like I think this kind of visualization the power of it is yeah all these kind of future looking things I think they need interfaces to you know become more accessible and and also even even I think if you're the most hardcore programmer out there you'll probably enjoy having I guess some people know some people will just command line tools till the end but I I just find it so useful Rudy thank you so much for joining the podcast thank you Connor it was great to be here ",
