{"text": "Thank you for watching the 18th Weaviate Podcast with Vincent D. Warmerdam! Vincent is an engineer at Spacy working on ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nchecking out the wva podcast today i'm \nhere with vincent warmerdam an engineer \nat explosion ai which is a part of \nspacey and vincent is working on some \nreally exciting things with nearest \nneighbor search and the things that \nwe're interested in at we b8 so vincent \nthank you so much for coming on the \npodcast and can you tell us about the \nthings that you're doing with nearest \nneighbor search \nsure thanks for the introduction um so \nthere's a couple of experiments that i'm \ndoing uh part of those are related to \nthis tool that we make so prodigy you \nmight have heard of it it's a labeling \ntool um and i have recently found out \nthat for uh like some of my experiments \nit really helps to have a good \napproximate nearest neighbor uh look up \naround um there's two areas that i were \nthere were i was pleasantly surprised \nwhere it worked quite well uh so one \narea is in the case of data \ndeduplication turns out you can do a \ncouple of really neat tricks there um \nbut i also noticed that if you are like \nstarting with labeling let's say an nlp \ndata set and there's also a couple of \ntricks that you could do within the \napproximate nearest neighbor look up so \num part of my work what i do is uh i i \ndo a little bit of research a little bit \nof customer support um kind of like \ndoing lots of things over the company um \nbut usually whenever i do a little bit \nof research that also results in like a \nplug-in or a blog post and recently i've \nalso been making some youtube videos on \nthis uh stuff \num \nso yeah i've i've been surprised at how \nflexible approximate nearest neighbor \nlook up tables are for like a really \nbroad set of applications but i but the \nmain thing that i thought was \ninteresting is data duplication and uh \nlabeling weren't the most natural \ncandidates that came up in my mind um so \nyeah that was like a pleasant surprise \nyeah i think this is super interesting \nat looking at how we can do this nearest \nneighbor search from just the obvious \nmatch the query with the documents thing \nand how we can look at these we'll dive \ninto these two ideas of data \ndeduplication and then bulk data \nlabeling or say \nweak supervision and we'll have that \nlet's maybe start with data \ndeduplication uh can you tell me about \nthe general kind of setup of this \nproblem \nyeah so uh let's say that you have a \nquestionnaire \nand you know there's a name and there's \nan address and zip code \nsome information let's say \nand let's say that in this questionnaire \ni may have gotten interviewed twice but \nin one situation my name got misspelled \num okay so that's a very clear example \nof a misspelling should not indicate a \nseparate entity in a database so \nprobably this has to get merged \nand you say this you kind of go like \nokay questionnaires are kind of cute but \ndoes it have business applications um \nand then you learn very quickly that \nlike when banks merge for example their \ncustomer profiles also need to merge and \nit would be a shame if let's say the \nsame mortgage appears in the data set \nfive times \num so this is like a genuinely important \nbusiness case \num \nbut then you kind of think like okay \nwhat are the standard ways of solving \nthis \nand you can go with the rule-based \nsystem \ndirection you can kind of say well uh \nlet's only look at people in the same \nzip code and then if the strings are \nsimilar enough of the name you know we \ncan make a little candidate list \nand that's actually like a fair approach \nthat will work for a large chunk of the \ndata uh but probably not all because you \nhave high precision but maybe not the \nhighest recall when you do that \nbut then if you start thinking well \nmaybe we can do like a little encoding \ntrick where we say let's take a name of \na person \nand let's take three grams like the \ncharacters so to say so vin and then i n \ne and like \nyou basically encode it that way you get \nthis little sparse array \num and then even if it's spelled \nslightly differently like the sparse \narrays will still be somewhat similar \nbecause there still will be a bit of \noverlap \nwith all these \ncharacter engrams \nso that can get you thinking like hey \nmaybe we can encode some of these \ncategorical variables as text with just \na sparse encoding and then if we just \nindex all of that and we have a new \ncandidate and we just say look this new \ncandidate is there a duplicate of it \njust fetch the 10 nearest items and uh \nif there's a duplicate that's probably \nin that set of ten items \num and of course you can do fancier \nthings if you're dealing with text um \nsimilarly you can also use embeddings \nlet's say \nbut i've noticed just with some of these \nsparse tricks like the sparse embedding \nones the results were quite reasonable \num which \nyou can do some fancy things like you \ncan also do thresholding right so you \ncan look at the distance of the items \nthat you get back and you can kind of \nsay well only look at the items where \nthe distance is this big or this small \net cetera uh and i was actually \npleasantly surprised how easy to set \nsuch a thing up and also that it kind of \njust works um \nthe the way that you encode things \nespecially if it's like names and you're \nmainly concerned about spelling um like \nthe standard encodings for sparse stuff \nreally lends itself well for these kinds \nof lookups um so it was like a very \npleasant surprise um \nif folks are interested uh this is \nsomething i'm also exploring on the \nyoutube channel using prodigy but just \nthe whole idea of maybe doing data \nduplication this way i think it's very \npowerful \nyeah so it's um so when i hear data \ndeduplication i think of it maybe \nusually from the perspective of say \nyou're training a language model and you \nget internet scale text and you want to \nde-duplicate repeat instances or \ni guess generally looking at data sets \nwhere you don't want to have \nthe same instance repeated twice because \nmaybe with the kind of bias of gradient \ndescent it's going to be overfit to that \nparticular kind of thing but it sounds \nlike you're coming at it from the \nperspective of say uh knowledge graph \nconstruction or uh this kind of \ncustomer databases yeah like a little \nbit more in that wrong yeah \nyeah really interesting it's really \ninteresting way to kind of summarize the \ndata set too by merging similar vectors \nhow does this differ from say like a \nk-means kind of clustering sort of \ncompared to just kind of like merging it \ndown with the semantic categories i mean \nso the download \nk means is not an unreasonable idea \nright but you do immediately hit the \nissue of how big should k be like that's \nkind of like okay \nyou solve one problem but you also \nintroduce another one and you simply \ndon't have that if you just have a \nsensible way of encoding things um and \nagain it depends a bit on what your \nconcern is right so if spelling errors \nare your concern then sparse encoding is \nlike the obvious way to go about it \nif sentiment is more your concern and \nit's like a bit of written text and \nmaybe you're a bit more interested in \nbot behavior let's say like hey is there \nsomeone who wrote nearly the same thing \nuh then at some point you know language \nmodels and text embeddings those things \nbecome a bit more interesting \num \nbut one thing that uh that i realized as \ni was sort of doing this work is um if \nyou have a tabular data set let's say \nsome names and addresses or a graph \nright and different nodes you can choose \nto encode uh each column differently so \nyou are free to say like okay but this \nis a user with a name okay that's going \nto be sparsely encoded and what the user \nis saying \nright that can be with dense models and \nyou just concatenate the two um maybe do \nsomething more fancy with like \ndimensionality reduction as a \npost-processing thing but that also can \njust still be indexed like that's also \nlike a an aspect of like deduplication \nwith approximate errors neighbors that i \nthink is pretty interesting too there's \nyou can use the same column in two \ndifferent encodings you can encode each \ncolumn differently and you can actually \nuse a fair amount of domain knowledge to \nsort of steer the algorithm the way that \nyou like \nso i think there's a lot to that in this \nso \nwe're getting on the idea of how we \nencode the data how we produce the \nrepresentations and this idea of say \nsparse representations which are say \nlike bm25 tf the idf or say the \ncounterpart just ones and zeros yeah \nyeah \nand and um infusing that with the vector \nrepresentations that come from \nusually sentence transformers i think is \nwhat we're thinking about with text and \ndense passage retrieval these kinds of \nideas and fusing those two so so maybe \nwe could go a little further on this \nidea of how are you thinking about the \ncombination of sparse representations \nthat are usually based on some kind of \nkeyword counting what like how and i \nthink they vary mostly in how the \nvocabulary is constructed \nand uh and then fusing it with these \ndense retrieval methods yeah that's a \ngreat question because a lot of what \nyou're mentioning there is a bit of an \nunsolved problem because you you can go \nahead and just concatenate the two right \nyou can say i'll just concatenate the \nspar stuff with the dense stuff \nand you can wonder well what kind of \neffect will that have for like distance \nmeasures \nis the distance measure that i'm \ninterested in for like the text is that \ngoing to be different than the distance \nmeasure for like the users uh \nit might start getting a bit tricky \none thing you can do though and this is \nlike \nnot step one per se but maybe step two \nso let's say um step one is the the \nsimple trick was just sparse vectors for \nnow but by doing this we have actually \nbeen labeling two \nright so okay this was an actual \nduplicate this wasn't and this was an \nactual duplicate and this wasn't okay \nthe moment that we have a couple of \nthese examples then we can say okay part \nof my input is sparse part of my input \nis dense i'm going to put a dense layer \nbehind that \nand then i'm going to have after that \nlike an actual label that i'm going to \ntry to predict \num like i think this might be the \nneatest way to sort of merge the two \ntogether because then at least there's \nsome sort of a \nsignal from your label determining what \nthe next layer should be and then you \ncan use that hidden layer as your next \nembedding for your uh lookup so to say \nyeah \nsorry so so that that's an approach that \ni think uh is quite reasonable um but it \ndoes of course always depend on your \ndata how many columns you have etc \nbut yeah maybe we could stay on that a \nlittle more the idea of you have your \nsay bm25 representation and then you \nhave the representation that comes from \none of these sentence transformers \nso we have two vector representations \nand then say we want to put that into \nanother dense layer that is going to do \nthe say we could call this multimodal \nfusion if we'd like \nyeah not sure some phrase like that yeah \nsome phrase right yeah \nso what would that architecture look \nlike we have the two vectors should we \nmaybe \nuh would it be like an attention layer \nin that \nlike because we could have the mlp where \nwe just concatenate the vectors like if \nyou're asking mine \nso i would start simple really right i \nmean especially because in the beginning \nyou're not going to have millions of \ndata points right um so then keeping it \nlightweight is probably the most \nreasonable way to go about it \num \nand also the thing like if you want to \ndo stuff of attention typically you also \nneed an extra tokenizer involved and the \norder of the tokens might start to \nmatter and stuff so \nit's not just the it's not just more \nvectors it's also some of that stuff you \ngot to keep in mind and again like my \nvantage point at the moment is a little \nbit more that i have a table with many \ncolumns uh and then for one column i \nsuddenly need a tokenizer and for the \nother one i don't \nto keep things simple i would just keep \nit fast forward and dense um \nand also like a thing that i've noticed \nwith this deduplication stuff um at \nleast on the data sets that i've been \ndemoing on \num \nimagine that we're actually doing this \nfor like a bank let's say we're trying \nto merge customers together and then at \nsome point it turns out that uh for some \npeople there's like a typo in their \nsocial security number let's say \nbut for other people just a completely \ndifferent number like obviously a \ndifferent number \num \nokay yeah maybe that's a duplicate but \nthat also should be flagged for fraud \nright \nso the business case also whenever \nyou're doing something with duplication \nthere's \na lot of the time i would say maybe also \nlike a fraud angle involved and because \nyou're then also in the realm of \nmultiple targets that you might be \ninterested in right um \nthen you kind of want to have a neural \nnetwork maybe with two output nodes and \nthen again keeping it simple just the \ndense layer i would argue is probably \nthe first thing you want to do \nyeah i'm really happy you brought the \nbanking data set idea into the picture \nbecause i think our conversation is \ngetting into that realm where having a \ndata set really would help communicate \nthis idea um so the data set to me that \njumps out the most and i'd love to get \nyour comments on this is the core of \nquestion pairs of duplicate questions \nbut maybe it's not maybe it's not long \nenough i know those questions are \nusually only like 10 words long and \nyou know as i've been studying vector \nsearch with we v8 i've seen like big and \nmaybe not like massive inputs but only \n10 words long is not great for this idea \nif we're going to combine bm 25 and dpr \nand have a another density on that it's \nnot really the best data set for that \nso maybe another example and again the \nbanking example is is great although i i \nthink i'd like to first start with \nsomething that's purely text for drawing \nhow we do this so maybe we could use the \nthe same heuristic they use in wikipedia \nwhere to train the sentence transformers \nthey use the heuristic of neighboring \nparagraphs are going to be positive \n[Music] \nso \nand it gives us a good sequence length \nof say like 200 tokens so we can \ncombine bm 25 and dpr \nso so say we take the wikipedia data \ntrain test split and then we have our \nbm25 of each paragraph and our sentence \ntransformer embedding and then we train \nour you know the dense fusion layer on \ntop of that to have the agreement do you \nthink that would be uh \na good example of \ntying this together yeah so \ni my background's not really in search \nso much so what i am going to attempt \nnow is a little bit of a guessing game \nand someone who's more knowledgeable \nmight be able to \ntell me that i should read another paper \nbut \num just for just pragmatically whenever \nyou're going to be doing some merging \nright \num \ncan we guarantee that the labels are of \nhigh quality because we are probably \ngoing to have to say like okay we have \nto be super sure that this is an actual \nanswer to that question or we have to be \nsuper sure that this definitely isn't an \nactual answer to that question \nand because we're dealing with language \nthis is not there can be a whole lot of \nnuance right \num and my impression is that there's a \nvery similar problem in the realm of \nlike queries and so \nthis one query that a user typed and \nthen the user then clicked this one \nother thing while would the user have \nalso clicked something else \nyou don't always know \nso i think from my perspective the issue \nis maybe not so much the architecture \nthat i would be primarily concerned with \nbut maybe more just a data quality like \nam i really really sure \nthat i have meaningful labels that can \nactually propagate some sort of \nknowledge into these layers \num \nhaving said that the moment you are sure \nabout your layers then it's much easier \nto iterate because then you can trust \nyour metrics a bit more as well um but \nespecially if you're just getting \nstarted with this deduplication stuff i \nwould be more worried about that like \nare we sure it's a fraud case are we \nreally really sure it's an actual um \nduplication or is this or is it actually \na person who lives in the same street \nwho just has a slightly different name \nbecause that also happens \nyeah the the part of encoding it is so \ninteresting and maybe quickly before we \ngo into the bulk data labeling as well \ncould we could you expand on the idea of \nthe index or half of this one of the \nmost interesting parts of we've eight is \nthat hmsw built in the approximate \nnearest neighbor benchmarking in that \nwhole world uh could you tell me how \nlike that kind of approximate nearest \nneighbor search for \nsay large scale deduplication what that \nkind of picture looks like \nwell so it usually gets started on a \nsmall set right and it's also something \ni've noticed with the annoy library the \nannoy library is quite good but the \nmoment the data sets get uh fairly \nbigger um you're going to want to start \nadding more trees quickly like \nuh i used to be a bit more positive \nabout this but especially like i've \nnoticed that with word embeddings as \nwell you might want to have 10 000 \ntrees which feels a bit much but that \nmight actually be quite reasonable \num \nso the main thing from my perspective at \nleast because i'm more interested in \ndata quality uh whatever \na n solution i have i \nkind of don't want to think about it too \nmuch um so i do think that the stuff \nthat i've been using so far is in the \nrealm of medium data uh and for those \nsorts of things like in memory stuff \nlike a n pine and descent those things \nkind of work but i do know if i'm going \nto go bigger then need like something of \na more formal like proper database \nsolution uh like and i can definitely \nimagine we've yet being a tool to \nconsider there yeah \nyeah quick quickly before uh could we \nstay on the the 10 000 trees and maybe \nexplain to our listeners a little more \nabout how the annoy algorithm works for \ndividing up the space so so to me annoy \nis very similar to like binary search \ntrees it's just instead of a scalar \ngreater than or less than it's like a \nhyperplane that divides this \nn-dimensional space um yes and there's \nno stochastic algorithm too so you have \nten thousand \nso could you could you explain further \nhow you get to twelve thousand um \ni could be somewhat wrong but my \nimpression of the algorithm at least is \nuh you just pick two random points and \nyou to make a plane between those two \nrandom points and boom that's your first \ncut \nand then from each leaf there you repeat \nand basically you do this a whole bunch \nof times and then you have one tree \nand then you know a binary tree so the \nlookup in the space can be quite fast \nand \nokay you can do that with one tree but \nthen the odds of you being in a leaf \nand then missing a couple of interesting \nneighbors is quite big \nso you know what we do we make a second \none of these trees or maybe a third and \nthen we put that in kind of an ensemble \nto figure out who the nearest neighbor \nshould be \num and on smaller data sets you might be \nable to get away with 10 of these trees \nbut for larger ones i've noticed uh you \nyou definitely might want to increase \nthe number of trees just because \notherwise it gets quite approximate \ni will say like uh i annoy is pretty \nquick when it comes to indexing like \nthat's something i did notice it was \nactually you know it's written i think \nit's written in c plus as well so it's \nactually quite fast \num \nbut uh you do want to keep an eye on \nthis one hyper parameter that's one \nthing i've noticed you should not uh you \nshould not blindly assume that 10 trees \nis enough because \nonce it gets bigger it just isn't \nso you ensemble the nearest neighbors \nfrom 10 000 trees to get all of the \npotential duplicates in the data i \nbelieve i believe that's what they do \nbut i uh but i could be mistaken because \ni didn't i didn't check the c plus \nsource code to know for sure but i \nbelieve this is the approach that they \ndo yes yes \nyeah it's really fascinating i love \nthinking about this idea of how the \ndeduplication finding nearest neighbors \nand then how you do it at a very large \nscale i think that's really interesting \nand \nand um maybe quickly we could kind of \njust entertain this idea around \ndeduplication for language modeling data \ndo you have you thought about that kind \nof thing and do you think that's \ninteresting yeah so before i used to \nwork at raza this was actually kind of a \npretty big topic there like hey when can \nwe understand when someone is saying \ngibberish like something we've really \nnever seen before \nbut the very simple conclusion i just \nkeep hitting my head on is just that \nlanguage is hard and there's a book from \nemily bender which is a little bit more \nabout linguistics for people who are \ndoing nlp and the first chapter just \nnails it on the head on this topic um a \nlanguage like language is more than just \na bag of words if i take the sentence a \nlion eats a man and i take another \nsentence a man eats a lion \none of those two sentences feels a bit \nmore probable than the other one but how \nam i going to teach an algorithm that \nright \nand and then language is also like a \nmoving target and then we've got \ninternet slang and oh can we also detect \nsarcasm and emotion and \nit it's really just a hard problem so \nagain the way that i would approach this \nis to just remind yourself that the \nlearning is really in the labels if you \nwant your algorithm to have certain \nbehavior just make sure that that \nbehavior is really encoded nicely \nin \nthe labels itself \nand and that's where language models \nalthough they're quite useful \nyou're usually predicting like a masked \ntoken or something like that and you can \nwonder well is that really the pattern \nthat you're interested in in your \napplication most of the time it isn't \nand that's why especially with explosion \nwith a tool like prodigy we really \nadvocate for like okay like focusing on \nthe labels that's probably where you can \nsteer the algorithm the most \nyeah and language is hard by the way and \nlanguage is really really hard that's \nalso the reminder that i keep getting uh \nwhen working in this field \nyeah that notion of language is hard and \ni love that you brought up that uh work \nfrom emily bender and it reminds your \npaper from emily bender and alexander \nkohler i think it's titled uh something \nlike on meaning form and understanding \nin nlu \nsounds like an uh emily bender paper yes \nit's a great paper it really helped me \nthink clearly about this and and let me \nquickly tell you a story from the paper \nthat i that i think really does this \nwell \nthe anecdote is this there are two say \nme and vincent we're stranded on islands \nand we've got a underwater cable that \ntakes from my island to vincent's island \nand i'm saying you know and i'm \ndescribing the island of vincent you \nknow there's palm trees sand \nand we're \npassing language through this cable and \nas the anecdote in the paper goes \nthere's an octopus that is oh yeah i \nthink yes i i think do go on but i \nfakely remember this now yeah yeah \nso the octopus is intercepting what \nwe're saying and so the octopus sees our \nmessages and it learns how to you know \ncut the cable talk to connor talk to \nvincent and vincent and i don't know if \nit's \neach other or it's the octopus but now \nyou get in i like to think of this as an \nof distribution event or a domain shift \nevent where suddenly there's a bear on \nmy island i'm like vincent help me \nthere's a there's a bear \nand how is the octopus supposed to know \nwhat a bear is \nin general emily bender has a lot of \nthese arguments that are like um \nso so i'm also that's also the thing i \ndon't know what your background is but \ni'm not a linguist like i was dyslexic i \nused to hate languages when i was in \nhigh school and now i've gotten more of \nan appreciation for it but i've always \ni've always noticed like also with some \nof my colleagues if they have a \nlinguistic background uh there's just so \nmuch more of a radar for these sorts of \nhey language is actually really hard \nthat this can also be happening \num \nbut yeah now the the i do remember that \npaper emily bender is worth uh uh we're \nkeeping an eye on uh because of these \nkinds of papers he also did the \nstochastic was he was part of the \nsarcastic parrots one as well i think \nright \nuh i'm i know i should be but i'm not \nlike terribly familiar with that one no \nbut \nthere's a bunch of super influential \npapers and papers i'll say that yeah and \nuh we've been working on but yeah \num yeah there's definitely lots of \nlanguage in it and it does make it \nthings like uh adding symbolic structure \nwith like syntax trees all i think all \nthat kind of that stuff could be really \ninteresting and maybe i think a nice \ntransition from here to kind of some \ntopics in wva for our listeners is um is \ni really like the graph like data model \nand things like semantic relations and \nontologies \nso kind of maybe to me one way to bridge \nthe linguist knowledge and then make it \nsort of amenable to deep learning \ntechniques would be to do these \nontologies and have semantic relations \nbetween data uh have you thought about \nthat kind of thing of say um maybe to \ndraw an example if if i'm modeling my \ntwitter data \ni might have tweets and then it has the \ncontent of the tweet and then it has has \narticle and then this article is this \nother kind of object that has the \ncontent of an article and \nthat's maybe that's an okay relationship \nuh idea of this another probably better \nexample \nwould be biomedical knowledge graphs \nwhere \nuh you start off with the knowledge \ngraph where you have like \nuh drug has target \nuh as bonding target and then so you \ncreate the ontology that way and then \nyou put uh text information that \ndescribes the genes describes the \ntargets \nuh describes cities pathways things like \nthat \nso i guess the question in the \nconversation topic would be \nhave you thought about semantic web \nontologies named relations as a way of \nadding \nlinguistic style \nsymbolic structure into the way that \nwe're doing nlp so i've dabbled with \nthis but very very briefly and i have \ncolleagues who are way more \nknowledgeable about this than i am the \nonly thing like from the what i will \nargue that i'm the novice here but from \nmy novice perspective one thing that i'm \nreally charmed by when i hear these \nsorts of things is i can imagine that if \nyou have a graph structure you can't put \na lot of domain knowledge in and that's \nactually quite useful like just in \ngeneral \nthe computer is the octopus who doesn't \nknow what a bear is but at least you can \ntell the graph that the bears are mammal \nand dangerous and and hungry uh like \nstuff like that for example right and \nthat's already nudging the algorithm \nkind of it feels like you might be \nadding a nice little constraint to your \nsystem \nand now graphs on the other hand are \nalso still graphs so they're not \nnecessarily \nlike uh they can be complex too right so \nyou're also introducing maybe some \ncomplexity but just that aspect of like \nyeah but we could put domain knowledge \nin that seems very useful to to me um \nfor sure \nand \nso that domain knowledge interface could \nbe useful for \ndeduplication because with similarity \nlabeling right you end up with a graph \nwhere you're saying this is similar to \nthis thing it's also similar to this \nthing \nso so maybe we could talk about the idea \nand coming back to labeling too i think \nit ties it together like how do we label \nsimilarity \nah \nthat's the eternal question that we've \nnot solved yet i think but \num like the way to think the way i like \nto think about it at least is again sort \nof coming back to the whole idea of the \nlearning is in the labels \nso \nuh before and uh i was talking to a \nretailer the other day what a very \ninteresting one so \num \nwhen we are out of normal spaghetti what \nis a good replacement product \nwell to some people uh it is going to be \nuh another pasta like any other kind of \npasta but to other people it has to be \nspaghetti so i'll just get like uh the \nthe whole oats like the super fibrous \nspaghetti instead \nokay who's right \nwell the similarities in the eye of the \nbeholder in a way right like it depends \non the use case too and you can also \nimagine that um \nlike if you have kids for example the \nshape little shape of the pasta also \nmatters because kids are stubborn they \nwill only eat the one pasta in a certain \ntype of shape \nand the food analogy but like but \nsimilarity is really also kind of an \nopinion if you think about it \nso the way i just really like to think \nabout that is just okay we have some \nsort of business case we try to define \nit as clearly as possible \nand then we try to label with like in a \nconsistent way and we try to achieve \nsome sort of a consensus \num \nthere's a very there's a lot of \ninteresting work also happening in this \nspace um if you want to have a fun look \nuh there is the google emotions data set \nand what's the data set has lots of \ninteresting label errors at least from \nmy perspective but the interesting thing \nis they also have the annotators in \nthere so you can actually track like hey \nwhen do annotators disagree \num a ton turns out \nlike uh just \nand especially in the realm of emotion \ndetection right um when is it sarcasm \nwhen is it humor uh when is it actual \njoy uh when is it actual anger a lot of \nthat is dependent on culture which is \nreally dependent on where you live \num so it's not necessarily a surprise \nthat \neven if you are a fluent english speaker \nbut you live in the other side of the \nworld and you're 40 that you're not \ngoing to understand what 20 year olds in \nthe u.s are posting on reddit \nor not perfectly at least no one should \nbe able to blame you for it \nand i think the best example i had while \nresearching this um folks who are \ninterested there's a youtube video i \nmade for prodigy on the techniques that \ni use but there was one \noh my god those tiny shoes i want to \nboop it snoot like that was like the \nsentence and then the question is is \nthis about excitement \ni would argue it is something booping a \nsnoot sounds like there's a photo of pet \nsomewhere and someone wants to gently \ntouch that nose so that sounds like \nexcitement to me \nbut i can't blame anyone for not \nunderstanding what booping a snoot is \nright that's kind of like internet slang \nin a way \nso there you so there you already kind \nof go like what is similarity well i \nwould argue it's similar if a label says \nit is um \nbut if again but hopefully the way that \nwe encode it correlates with it and \nthat's kind of useful when we have a \nnearest neighbor look up um so let's say \ni have a whole bunch of reddit data um \ni'm just gonna \nuse whatever featurizer uh whatever \ntransformer just sort of index it and \nodds are if i can just have one sentence \nabout a topic that i'm interested in \nkind of zero shot i am going to get \nexamples from my actual data set that \nare at least to some extent similar \nso if i'm let's say doing social media \nanalysis and i have \num i don't know a support desk for a \nlocal retailer um then if my delivery is \nlate then i can just type my deliveries \nlate encode that and hopefully what i \nget back \num are things that are in some sense \nsimilar \num but that then you label and then you \nmight get a better embedding so then you \nindex it again and then you get into \nthis little kind of weird active \nlearning loop where you have a model \nthat makes better embeddings which you \ncan actually use to re-index and uh \nhopefully by just iterating on this uh \nyou know you you're not just iterating \non your model you're also iterating on \nyour data and that hopefully is going to \nlead to like a very tight definition of \nsimilarity \nbut that's at least how i approach the \nlike to think about it at least \nyeah and i'm so excited to get into that \nloop of active learning week supervision \nand how uh say we've yet and vector \nembeddings can help with that quickly i \nwant to just tell a little more about \nthe \nannotation disagreement i i was very \ncurious in this idea of semantic \nrelations when i first saw we've eight \nand i was because i to me the idea of \nvector embeddings and also adding the \nkind of named relation thing wasn't an \nobvious \nconnection i asked bob about it and bob \ntold me the story that uh he was at a \nsemantic web conference and they were \nbuilding ontologies and they couldn't \nagree on what a c was or a lake like \njust \nsee this is a lake to us \nand it's that kind of disagreement in \nthe relations that i think you can that \nthese embeddings let you really capture \nbecause i because you can have two \nlabels where \ncoming back to your example it's sarcasm \nor it's excitement you can't really read \nit but you can have the two labels and \nit can kind of optimize for both the \nlabels and and capture the semantics \nthat could be either thing in that \nvector representation \nand then yeah this general idea of \nannotation disagreement with human \nlabeling i think that's i think there's \na lot to that especially when you're \nuh labeling really complex things like \nsay you're annotating scientific papers \nand \nso there's a there's a paper uh \ni hope i pronounced his name correctly \nthere's a bunch of authors but uh yo of \ngoldman goldberg i forget his last name \nterribly sorry but uh the the paper's \ntitle is something along the lines of uh \nare we annotating the task sorry are we \npredicting the task or are we predicting \nthe annotator \num \nwhich is a really good question if you \nthink about it turns out a lot of the \nannotated data sets out there \nnot at all all of them but like a good \nchunk of them you can kind of wonder \nwell how's the annotation in balance is \nit like a 2080 rule where maybe 20 \npercent of the annotators annotated like \n1280 of the yeah okay turns out for a \nbunch of data sets this is kind of \nhappening \nso then you can ask the question uh okay \num can we maybe predict who annotated \nthis thing or can we can we make a \nprediction per annotator so then the \nmodel output becomes not just hey what \nlabel is this but what would this \nannotator give for this label \nso \nthe paper makes a point here to say like \nhey the label is not perfect that's a \ngenuine concern but another way that i \nlike to think about it uh it would be \nkind of nice in production if we could \nsay hey the model's just kind of not \nsure \nso like won't predict it's kind of like \na flag that we can do we're only going \nto be automating when we're actually \nsure about our prediction and now \nsuddenly if you have let's say 20 \nannotators that you're kind of \npredicting and let's assume for all \nintents and use cases that you're going \nto do that correctly pretty accurately \nthen the moment that you know not all \npredictions agree that would imply that \nmaybe you're able to model that \nannotators wouldn't agree and that might \nmean that in production you should raise \nthe won't predict flag \nyeah that's brilliant that sounds like a \nreally exciting idea to me and maybe \nlike a well annotated data set is one in \nwhich you can't predict the \nannotator well so annotation's hard \nright \nbut genuinely like um \nit's it's much harder than i thought uh \nand also like \nback when i gave trainings in data \nscience one of my favorite things to do \nwas let's first annotate the data set \nwith sentiment because half the time \nwe're actually going to not agree on the \nlabel \nuh and then what what i also recommend \npeople do is even if you're doing like a \ntoy data set thing trying out the new \ntransformer library just check the data \nfirst because label errors are \npersistent um there's a website \nlabelers.com i don't know if you've been \nno but like um the quick draw data set \nlike according to their estimates has a \nten percent label error or ten right \nuh i i believe um \nthe amazon sentiment one has like two \npercent label there and that's well like \nyou know within the margin of state of \nthe art \nso \nit's uh it is just a hard problem again \nthe the only cure that i know or remedy \ni should say it's just uh the name of \nthe game is iterating just every week \nyou try to just have a meeting and you \nmake sure that the data scientist also \nlabels and the business person and then \nyou kind of go like okay let's look at \nthe examples we got wrong \nokay do we agree with the label that it \nwas predicting yes no and you know \nthat's uh that's the the remedy \nbut it's not easy like the modeling is \nthe easy that's just tense \nthis is an extremely interesting topic \nand i love exploring this application \nfor we've eaten and how we can \ntie it into these active learning \nuh loops and so so here's how i see the \npicture of how we can help with this and \nmaybe could uh you know add to what i'm \nmissing but so i imagine that we're say \nwe have some uh \nyou know \nwe're looking through our predictions \nand we see oh this one has been \nmislabeled then we find the nearest \nneighbors to that one and that's going \nto guide our where we're going to go \nlook for more mislabeled points so \nthat's so that's a tactic and that's \ndefinitely not a bad one um one thing to \nkeep in the back of the mind like the \nsituation always kind of depends like \nyou might be interested in just sampling \nmore from the rarest class right like \nthat can also be a really good reason so \nyou just say look there's this one class \nthat i'm really interested in but it's \nkind of rare maybe sample more of those \nand you can still use again you can use \nthe nearest neighbor lookup trick we're \njust gonna use it slightly differently \nanother thing you can also definitely do \nis like hey let's just grab some of the \nexamples where we have the most \nuncertainty and let's grab more of those \num \nthere can be more than just one valid \ntechnique um the one thing that i do um \nthe one the one thing i'm trying to sort \nof figure out and i'm not there yet um \nis just what's the most pragmatic way to \ngo about it because maybe sometimes \nyou'll just want to do random \num \nthat's a because i can imagine for \nexample right um \nlet's say we're doing a social media \nthing i'm interested in finding texts \nthat are about a failed delivery like \nthe customer complaints use case \nokay i might have lots of examples where \ni started out by just looking for the \nword deliver if the word deliver appears \nin the sentence it's probably about a \ndelivery and if someone is going \nreaching out to customer service it's \nprobably a complaint um okay so that can \nbe a very reasonable place to start but \nthen if you're going to look for \nneighbors that are very close to it you \nare probably going to get lots of \nsentences that just have the word \ndelivered in it those aren't bad \nexamples but it might take a while \nbefore you have a sentence with the word \norder in it \nso \nso okay how can you protect yourself \nagainst that well random is a thing that \nyou could do and just \ndo it a bit randomly make sure the \nsearch space is kind of covered uh there \nare also like some fancier techniques \nwhere you kind of do a k means thing \nfirst over your entire data set such \nthat you make sure that at least there's \na bit of coverage so say \num but this is also kind of the tricky \nthing with active learning um \nyou do want to construct a test set \nthat's not just because we were sampling \nthis way this week and we're going to \nsample a different way next week so \nbut but but it is still a game of \niteration that is something i do think \nis the pragmatic way to look at it and \none thing that i was pleased by is that \nthere are many tricks of going about \nthis but having a nearest neighbor look \nup is actually like a legitimate um \nthat worked quite well for a couple of \nthe tricks that i was doing which uh \nwhich is nice because not every trick \nworks it's nice that you find a trick \nthat doesn't work once in a while um \nyeah yeah it depends how big your data \nset is as well like i mean if you only \nhave 2 000 examples to start with then \nyou can probably brute force it on your \nlaptop but definitely the moment where \nyou start hitting like a 10 000 and \nsquaring that becomes a bit expensive so \nthat that's kind of the time where you \nmight want to start investing in the \nnearest stable lookup \ni think it's interesting also kind of \nthe \ncombination of the unstructured text \nlike our data like text or images with \nthis metadata as well and \nit kind of like what i'm imagining is i \ni really what you said to me about the \nidea that i'd want to do the nearest \nneighbor and then but look in the rarest \nclasses go hit the tail end of my data \nand so that really stood out to me as \nbeing an interesting way to come combine \nthe nearest neighbor search with say \nsymbolic filters about \nyou know which class is the rarest class \nyou can add and you can and i don't mean \nto be too heavy on the features of wba \nbut i i love that part that you can \ncombine nearest neighbor search with \nsymbolic filters \nto say like \nwhich sub which clusters are your data \nand you could use k means to \nadd the symbolic values of which cluster \nit's in \nto do that kind of thing \nand yes i think \nso i definitely so the general comment i \nhave here is in general post processing \non the query is a good idea and there \nare definitely many ways of doing it um \nanother like \nanother simple way like in the case of \ndeliveries you can also say give me \neverything back that doesn't have the \nword deliver in it \nbut but but stuff that is actually kind \nof close like it's another way i'm not \naware of the super symbolic feature you \njust mentioned in we've eight but uh but \ni do like in general i agree doing post \nprocessing afterwards can be quite \nmeaningful that's definitely also a \ntrick that's uh should be appreciated \nmore because a lot of people just think \noh i'm doing the nearest neighbor look \nup thing i got 100 items back then you \ncan also still wonder well you don't \nhave to go through all 100 of them maybe \nmaybe just try to find the most 10 most \ninteresting ones in that and then move \non to the next uh item \num of course depends on your data \ndepends your task etc but uh but give \nyourself the creative freedom like \nthat's the main point i'm trying to \nemphasize i guess \nyeah really interesting and i eddie and \ndidlocker has made something about pre \nand post processing in the symbolic uh \nfiltering and i'm not quite an expert on \nit but if people aren't interested in \ni'll leave it in the link in the \ndescription but \nyeah this combining of nearest neighbor \nsearch and symbolic filters \nvery interesting for this kind of data \nlabeling \nfinding problems in data labeling so \nyeah it's really interesting so let me \nkind of pivot out a bit and ask you more \nof a broad question about this whole \nspace of nlp and i'm very curious and \nsomething that guides my thinking is \ndo you have a particular application and \ni do think that chatbot thing is \nextremely interesting but do you have a \nparticular application that you're \nusually focusing on developing and you \nkind of generalize these abstractions \ninto developer tools like \nuh like spacey and so on um \nso you mean uh personally or it's spacey \nprofessionally because i maintain a \ncouple of personal open source \nprojects as well \nbut my role at explosion is a bit broad \nat the moment so like one day i'm doing \nsupport tickets the other day i'm doing \nopen source stuff the other day i'm \ndoing a couple of pr's to fix a couple \nof bugs the other day i'm making content \nso it's exposure my role is quite broad \nat the moment \num \nbut but you know we we also offer a \nconsultancy service these days um \nand they are typically like uh to \nwhatever problem a client has \nsomeone says hey vincent can we just uh \nyou know \nzuma for a bit and like exchange ideas \num but i also think in that realm of nlp \nthat we typically have clients \num it is a bit on the classification and \nentity detection like those kinds of \ntasks we we don't do generative \nalgorithms \ni think at all um it's mainly like hey \ncan we detect interesting substrings uh \nand can we maybe say something general \nabout this uh this bit of text about \nthis document and those are the typical \nthings that we do those that's like \ndefinitely our specialty so to say and \nthat's also where \nlike our annotation tools can also kind \nof make a difference because we have ui \nelements that are like really really \ngood for those specific tasks \num \nso the \nthat's the most typical thing i would \nargue in the spacey realm that you see a \nlot of but then again \nbecause i also do a lot of stuff with \nprodigy like a lot of my work is also \nmaking interesting demos um the cool \nthing about prodigy is in the end you \ncan script it it's just a python backend \nso you can make your own custom labeling \ninterface and use whatever your favorite \npython tool is so part of my job \nin that realm that is actually \ninteresting i suppose also like in the \nbroader sense is you can actually \nexplore like what are \ncool annotation tricks that you might be \nable to do and finding bad labels is one \nfor example like hey are there some \ntricks where we can automatically make a \nlist of candidates that this might be a \nbad label and again you can use the \nnearest neighbor lookup thing where you \ncan say hey \nthe label of this one point is let's say \nclass a but all of its nearest neighbors \nis b okay there you go there's probably \nsomething fishy happening there we \nchecked it out \num but but that's kind of if i can point \nout anything that's really fun about the \njob that i have is a lot of the time i \ncan actually make really cool annotation \ndemos and because i can use whatever \ntools python can use inside of prodigy i \ncan just sort of do neural like \nbasically anything that python can do \nand that opens up a lot of the doors um \nthat said um \nthe hardest part is usually what makes a \ngood label like that's a qualitative \nthing as well that's definitely still \nthe hardest part i think \nyeah what \nand then another questions and maybe a \nlittle scattered now but i'm sure so \nwhat do you think about maybe like a \ncollaborative data labeling interface so \nlike i you know i share it with my team \nand we all like so we it's like a ui but \nall of us are together it's kind of like \nsay like notion for data labeling that \nkind of thing \ni mean so um \ndepends on how you want to set up \nprodigy but the way a lot of people like \nback in the day when i was doing demos \nwhen i wasn't working at explosion the \nway i would just do it is hey data \nscience class we are about to do \nlabeling uh on my own local machine i've \ngot the server running ngrok and it's \nnow public and people can sort of uh \njoin in \num so it's just a server you can open it \nup on your mobile phone uh so that's \nactually something uh like there are \nthese labeling workshops that is my \nimpression this is something that people \nactually do like hey um \nteam of engineers get together and \nthey're gonna say like hey we're \nactually trying to maybe build a new use \ncase um we're going to do a sprint of a \nweek and day one is just going to be \nlabeling \nand then usually after labeling for a \nday you kind of have you've seen enough \ndata so you also know some of the \nexceptions um and like it's not \nnecessarily notion because it is saved \nin a flat file most of the time but uh \nbut that like i hear stories that people \nare actually doing this and one thing \nthat i have her one story that i have \nheard that was actually kind of funny uh \nthere are lots of these examples where \nyou start out with the use case we're \ntrying to do a customer sentiment or \nsomething like that but then after \nlabeling you find out that actually \nthere's fraud in here too \nbecause you're actually looking at like \nthe raw logs and you're kind of going \nthat's not a customer that's a bot \nwhere doing the labeling the use case \ncan actually kind of shift because you \nare actually confronted with the data uh \nthat is something we've also seen those \nare stories that i have heard let me put \nit that way \nsuper cool so the next question well \nquickly let me ask you a quick question \njust to fill in my knowledge can you \ntell me a little more about ngrok is \nthat what makes it easy to create these \nuh you know like web services from \npython or it's more like a tunnel so \nit's it's basically like if i have \nsomething running on my local host on my \nlaptop that's great but then you can't \ngo to my local host but then i can tell \nngrok hey just open up a little tunnel \nand then ngrok will then have a public \nuh url basically and that's gonna \nforward to my local machine so for demos \nit's really great \nnot for production by the way don't do \nit for production but for demos and like \nshowing stuff to the people locally \nright it's great um they have a free \nsurface they also have a paid one uh but \nfor especially for trainings and like \njust quickly sharing the labeling \ninterface without having to worry too \nmuch about security and grocery i can \nhighly recommend it and that plugs \nnicely with say google collab right \nwhere you can \nis that how like i know um like radio \nthey give you like a temporary web \naddress for your app when you run it in \ngoogle collab is that how it's done \noh i'm not aware so i i've never really \nused gradio uh and i'm also not the \nbiggest collab user i have my own little \nlinux server at home that i prefer to \nuse but uh it could be i'm not a so \ncan't answer that properly because i've \nnot used radio yet \noh yeah yeah i'm just curious i was um \nwhen i was looking through uh simcity \none of your projects that you're \ninvolved in i saw the the way that you \nhave that one line of code to set up the \nhosting and i was and i've generally \nbeen seeing these this \nthat's a fast api server \nso that's just a fast api server um so \nthe for folks are listening uh some of \nthe ideas that we are mentioning here i \nmade an open source project a while ago \ncalled simcity it's misspelled so \ns-i-m-s-i-t-y \nuh it's the joke that i had was it's all \nabout building a neighborhood so that's \nwhy i call it simcity um \nit's a bit of a hacky project like it's \nit's \nit's a brain fart that's pip installable \nbut it's not like i'm actively \nmaintaining it so feel free to play \naround with it but don't expect support \nsorry \num but one of the things that you're \nable to do the the goals that i had \nthere just very quickly was that i was \nable to sort of do exactly what we just \ntalked about here's a data frame here's \na couple of columns here's how i wanted \nto encode here's i wanted to index go \nand then you could use all sorts of ui \nwidgets from jupyter notebook or just \nrun it as a fast api server and you'd \nhave your rest endpoint or you can just \nsort of say hey here's a json object \nwith like a name an address etcetera \ngiving back to the 10 most closest \nneighbors uh that like that old part \nit's the thing that tries to automate \nand sorry do you mind telling me a \nlittle more about fast api yeah so fast \napi is a it's it's basically like flask \nbut has a couple of more modern features \nthat are quite nice now i want to say \nmodern here and i do want to acknowledge \nlike the flash project has also \ngotten a couple of new features in so \nboth projects have their own pros and \ncons but uh fast api is relatively fast \nas the name implies \nbut it's just a very likable python \nserver that's really easy to set up \num there's it is a bit newer so the one \nof the main reasons to maybe still \nconsider flask is that the plugin \necosystem is just a little bit more rich \num \nbut for example fast api did have like a \nsync support right out of the box um i \nthink flask also has it now but they \nintroduced it last year if i'm not \nmistaken so for all intents and purposes \nit's like flask it's a little bit more \nlightweight and you get a bunch of stuff \nfor free so like the docs automatically \ngenerate for example for all your api \nendpoints if you add the docs string but \nfast api is nice if you want to make a \nquick web server such that other people \ncan communicate with your machine \nlearning app fast api is a pretty \nconvenient way to just quickly set \nsomething up \nfascinating thank you so much for that \nreally interested in the trending these \nkinds of tools that are making it so you \nknow you if you're just like kind of a \nmachine learning scientist it's getting \neasier and easier to share your things \nwith people and \nand yeah these kinds of tools um so let \nme ask you another uh \nsorry well i'm gonna make a little pitch \nthen so uh i do also host this thing \ncalled calm code uh so which is \nbasically like a learning center for \nlike stuff that i made uh it's \nthe premise is it's like educational \ncontent but not on youtube \nso i don't want you to get distracted uh \nbut if you're interested in ngrok or \nfast api i mean there's free tutorials \nthere uh if people are interested in \nlearning it um \nit's two to five minute videos after \nwatching for half an hour you know how \nit works uh so ngrok fast api if you \nwant to learn it tons of places where \nyou can learn it but comcode i've made a \ncouple of tutorials so if people are \ninterested those are for free uh please \nwatch \nthey're great tools they really are \nin addition to the quality of the \ncontent i also have to complement the \nquality of the styling on that website \nit's not a little cool black and white \nicon thing \num so okay i'll make another pitch \nthere's this project called the noun \nproject \nand i can and i'm a paying member it is \nthe greatest service effort for every \nsingle noun they have a black and white \nicon both in svg and in black and white \nit's amazing for presentations the noun \nproject is an amazing amazing uh bit of \nsoftware that i'm proud to pay money for \nit is the best \nand yes every icon that i have on the \ncalm code comes from that website um and \ni kind of just love how it has like a \nyou know portal the video game it kind \nof has like that kind of a vibe to it as \nwell yeah but but yeah i don't want to \ntake credit for those icons folks over \nat the noun project should but \nnon-project's great \nso on the topic of making content can i \nask you about kind of i don't know if \nit's too into like yours your you know \ncore strategy but could you tell me \nabout content strategy and how you think \nabout that kind of thing and \nyeah well i mean \nso the story is a little bit funny um \nbasically uh the way i got into this \nwhole content thing i mean i was \ndefinitely like a teacher before so i \ntaught calculus and university and you \nknow there's definitely like a teaching \nthing i did that for clients back in the \nday um but the way i got started in this \nsort of content developer advocacy kind \nof stuff was i went to this conference \ncalled spacey in real life \nand when i went there i had never done \nnlp before \nuh but i figured you know a spacey \ncool project if i go there i might learn \nsomething about nlp \num so i you know \nyou uh you hang out with people and i \nactually met matt and enos like the \nfounder of the explosion company and you \nknow you go to a bar \nand \nat some point i make a really bad joke i \ngo up to matt enis i mean i say the \nprevious bar is really busy but this one \nis nice and spacey \nyou know really really corny joke uh but \napparently \nfrom my perspective yeah \ni didn't get hired then but what they \ntold me \nwhat they told me was vincent we think \nhe would youtube well you know a little \nbit about data science you're kind of \nyou have a good voice and you're you \nknow you're kind of funny would you be \ninterested in maybe making some spacey \ncontent and i figured you know i can \nlearn from like the two people \nspearheading this project which is \nmaking a huge impact uh if i say yes i'm \ngonna be able to learn from them that's \na pretty good deal \nand um i'll i can give this whole \nyoutube thing a try \nthat's how i got rolling um but \nthe deal that i did made because i \ndidn't really want to become a youtuber \nin a sense of click and subscribe like \nthat felt kind of lame i genuinely \nwanted to just make um \nlike a nice example nice and tangible \nlike if you want to apply spacey let's \njust show how you can use it to solve a \nproblem \nand they were super on board with that \nas well so it was like \ntwo hands on one belly as they say in \nthe netherlands um but the funny thing \nthen was i was making some of the spacey \ncontent and then right around that time \npeople over this company called raza \nthey were interested in someone who \ncould explain algorithms \nand then they said hey vincent we like \nthe style we see on the spacey thing \nthat you've made could you do something \nlike that but for chatbots \nso that's kind of how the ball got \nrolling but \nthe main thing i really care about is \nthat i just explain things relatively \nclearly and i think that's enough \ni'm sure i don't mind if people follow \nme on twitter and i also speak of pie \ndatas and i like it if the room is full \nsure \nbut i get a little bit annoyed sometimes \nwhere \nyou're looking at like a youtuber trying \nto explain something in data science \nthere are plenty of really good ones but \ni wanna but it has to be about the \ncontent like i really wanna see like a \nreally nice explainer i love seeing what \npeople have like i found an interesting \ndata set and this one trick works in \nthat data set i don't like it when \npeople regurgitate this i could learn \ndocs \num \nthat's the main thing and it's also why \non the comcode website i don't want my \nface in it because i really wanted to be \nabout the content \nnow of course i also make videos for \nexplosion and we put that on youtube and \nwe don't have a coherent style so there \nit makes much more sense that my face is \nalso perhaps in the video uh but my \npersonal uh preferred style is to just \nhave very calm content that's the thing \nthat i like uh most and i'm trying to do \nthat on youtube as well the only \ndownside of the platform is that every \nturn it does try to distract you with \nits recommendations so that's kind of a \nbit of a downside i suppose but \nbut i don't really have much of a \ncontent strategy besides i try to make \ngood interesting content by trying to \nfind interesting examples uh and sure \nyou know we we have a content planning \nthing where \nif i've made a 40 minute long video we \ndo want to announce it properly right so \nyeah we do that \nbut i really just try to find \ninteresting content first that's that's \nthe strategy \nand one of those and one of the first \nthings i made for explosion was \ndeduplication by the way like how can \nyou do deduplication using prodigy uh \nbecause one thing i one thing i uh in \ngeneral that i have observed is i mean \nprodigy is great for labeling nlp tasks \nbut there's way more tasks just like \nwith these nearest neighbor lookups um \nthat you can apply it for and really \ngoes well beyond lp uh i mean i can also \nimagine a m being useful for some \ncomputer vision tasks like that wouldn't \nsurprise me at all um but i can but i \nbut i get why there's lots of nlp \ncontent out there because i also see \nthose applications uh but uh a n stuff \nand also like the labeling stuff goes \nwell beyond just nlp this also \nkind of the point i want to make with \nsome of the prodigy videos that i'm \nmaking there now \nso yeah long story that's our strength \nthat's my strategy \nthe last thing you said \ni do kind of want to talk about that a \nlittle a little more the very last thing \nyou said about the nlp computer vision \nthing \nand uh well but \nsorry but i the story i found really \ninteresting and i actually kind of want \nto get into that a little bit more so it \nseems to me like you know you're \nengineering by day and then you you know \nyou the problems you solve you turn into \ncontent and that's kind of the way of \nthinking about it rather than like \nthe i'm seeking the purpose of this is \nto make oh yeah \nso for com \nfor calm code for sure like i've not \nmade content in months because i've not \nseen it so uh but i will say like for \nprodigy it's a little bit different \nuh because for prodigy i am actually \nsort of actively looking for what would \nmake a really cool demo to show off a \nlittle trick \num \nso it wouldn't surprise me if maybe at \nsome point i i show off an approximate \nnearest neighbor trick let's say because \nthat's something i'm actively sort of \ntrying to figure out and similarly i \nalso i'm also doing some annotator \ndisagreement because i'm pretty sure \nlike if i just have a couple of data \nsets with google really cool examples of \nannotated disagreement then i could \nprobably make like a good blog post or a \nvideo uh so \num like the one thing uh also like calm \ncode and my personal blog those are like \nmy personal projects and i really like \nhaving an off switch \nbut from prodigy that's \nso that means that you know a good chunk \nof my week i can think about like what \nwould make a really compelling example \nand what's like a really uh cool feature \nthat we might be able to show off so \nthat i would argue like there's a bit of \na difference there in that sense \nyeah for me this part of showing a \nreally cool example is so much about \nfinding a really cool data set do you \nagree with that yeah \nyou know for sure if you don't have a \ncool data set \nit's kind of like uh oh we can make \nmaybe we can do a benchmark on uniform \ndata you kind of go yeah i know i see i \ncould see why you but yes technically \nyou have a benchmark it's just another \nvery interesting one \nright um so for sure but finding the \ndata set for sure is like one of the \nharder parts though \nyeah yeah i love working at a database \ncompany because i to me it's like the \nalgorithms they're awesome but it's like \nlet's find more data sets to hit this \nstuff with you know like \nthat kind of task of i always find \nmyself drawn to let's go find a data set \nor let's build a data set you know and \nthat \nkind of thing always appeals to me \nyeah and um \nit's also kind of the thing where you \nwant to have a data set that's also not \ntoo small not too big right so this \ninteresting data set is also not \nnecessarily a well-defined definition \nbut you what you're hoping for is that \nyou have a data set where you can sort \nof tell a story where at some point \nthere's a like a luke skywalker and a \ndarth vader in your data set and at some \npoint you're trying to figure out like \nwho wins let's say uh could be and that \nwas like um \ni i would like to do a little bit more \nwith fraud data that's like access logs \nor something like that i think that \ncould be interesting too um also because \nthere there's gonna be some sort of \nencoding you're gonna wanna have maybe \nwith some urls and timestamps let's say \nbut it's also not really nlp it's \nstructured text \nbut definitely for sure you can do some \ninteresting stuff there i think um \nyeah maybe quickly we've \ni had some conversations about maybe \nturning structured data into text like \nwhere you parse the table to try to turn \nit into text and and this is like \nhorribly off topic but \nwhat do you think about it yes i i i i \nmight have heard someone trying \nsomething like that um never done it \nmyself to be honest like one like \nespecially when i talk about tables like \none thing i have also \num \nso a use case that i'm aware of is that \nthey thought like oh we are going to be \nscanning documents and then we're going \nto do ocr \nand then we're going to try to see what \nthe values are in a table let's say \nand then you can kind of wonder well is \nthat an nlp problem or is that maybe \nmore of a you know a computer vision \nproblem let's say because maybe you \ndon't have to scan the entire document \nmaybe you just need a pre-processing \nstep that says hey where's the table \nright yeah \nso um \nso i do know a couple of people who are \nworking in that realm uh and also that's \nnot necessarily a solved problem because \nwith tables you gotta imagine yeah you \ngot english \nbut you also have tables written in \nchinese so \nyou also need to be able to handle those \nand \nthat's substantially different typical \nocr stuff doesn't handle both chinese \nand english at the same time \nbut again a lot depends on what's the \nright label and what's the use case that \nremains the same \nyou have like document structure \nunderstanding thing that seems like \nbooming application as well you got the \nlegal documents maybe you got like \ninvoices or \nmedical stuff yeah \nyeah \nyeah \nwell thank you so much for uh coming on \nthe eva podcast i love talking about \ndeduplication bulk labeling and just all \nthese topics it's so much fun to chat \nwith you and thanks again \nhappy to hear it \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Vincent D.
