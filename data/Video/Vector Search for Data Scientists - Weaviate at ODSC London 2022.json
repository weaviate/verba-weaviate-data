{"text": "How can the latest advances in Vector Search help Data Scientists? As a Machine Learning content creator for a few years, I have ... \nhey everyone i'm really excited to be \npresenting our talk at the latest open \ndata science conference in london as a \npart of our vector search track i was \npresenting vector search for data \nscientists i really hope you find the \ntalk interesting and a huge thank you to \nthe open data science conference \ncommittee and team for all sorts of \nthings from guiding me through how to \nuse the webinar software and generally \naccepting me to be a speaker at the \nconference thank you so much this was \nsuch an exciting opportunity and to \neveryone out there listening i really \nhope you find this talk interesting this \npresentation will explore the use of \nvector search for data scientists \nincluding a case study with twitter \nanalytics so we'll begin the \npresentation by \nlooking at how i'm defining data science \nvector search and twitter analytics case \nstudy before diving into the details of \nlinking these things together so what \nare some common questions in data \nscience we typically have some kind of \nthing that we're observing like the \nnumber of impressions that we're getting \nfor our tweets or say views for youtube \nvideos and we want to look at questions \nlike how is my data distributed is it \nnormally distributed power law \ndistributed are there particular \noutliers in my data and the third \nquestion that i really want everyone to \nfocus on with this talk is the question \nof are my variables correlated with each \nother and trying to explore \nrelationships between our variables and \nseeing how they impact the distribution \nof the thing that we're the most \ninterested in so say we're most \ninterested in the distribution of \nimpressions on our tweets we also want \nto look at variables like what time the \ntweet was sent or whether the tweet \ncontains a url to try to see if that can \ngive us some insight about the \ndistribution of impressions on tweets in \nvector search we're looking at a new way \nof search where we represent objects \nwith vector representations extracted \nfrom deep learning models so the key \nquestions are how well can we capture \nthe semantics in vector representations \nand what can we learn about our data \nfrom the semantic clusters that are \nformed by these vector representations \nso this tying these together data \nscience and vector search is going to be \ndone with the example of twitter \nanalytics i've been \nmaking content on youtube and twitter \nfor a while now and i've been really \ninterested in this kind of problem of \ntrying to figure out the best way to do \nthis messaging \nhow to really kind of you know promote \nthe this content and make it successful \nso i'm looking at my own twitter \nanalytics data to try to get a sense of \nif i can segment it using vector search \nto get a better sense of the \ndistribution of the metrics i care about \nlike impressions or url clicks and see \nif there's any insights i can gain from \napplying vector search for data science \nand understanding twitter performance so \nif you're interested in performing this \nanalysis yourself you can easily go to \nthe right top right corner of the \ntwitter analytics dashboard to download \nthe csv files you can use the calendar \nicon to \ndownload up to i believe four months of \ndata and then you can just uh you know \nas this presentation will explain you \ncan easily upload it into wev8 to enable \nthese vector search functionalities \nso the twitter analytics it'll give you \nthe csv data file where you have \ndifferent columns like the raw content \nof the tweet itself as well as some \nfeatures like what time the tweet was \nsent and the metrics that were \ninterested in like impressions \nengagements engagement rate retweets \nreplies likes user profile clicks or url \nclicks and the interesting one the most \ninteresting detail about applying vector \nsearch to this is understanding this \nidea of having semantic representations \nfrom the raw unstructured text itself \nrather than approaches like feature \nengineering where maybe we try to \nextract features like whether the tweet \ncontains an emoji what the character \ncount is word count or if it contains \ncertain keyword phrases like weaviate or \ndeep learning and see what kind of \nsegmentation we can do with those kinds \nof features that we manually engineer so \nwith that primer on how i'm looking at \ndata science how i'm defining vector \nsearch and overall looking at this \ntwitter analytics problem this \npresentation is segmented into five key \nsections the first section is \nsegmentation and data science \nunderstanding how we split distributions \nbased on other attributes the second key \ntakeaway is to understand vector \nrepresentations of data how do deep \nlearning models produce vector \nrepresentations of real world objects \nthat capture the semantics in them the \nthird key topic is vector segmentation \nusing these vector representations to \nsegment our data the fourth key takeaway \nis this particular case study of using \nwev8 for twitter analytics and applying \nthe intersection of the ideas and vector \nsegmentation for twitter analytics using \nthe wev8 vector search database the \nfifth key takeaway are research \nquestions and discussions about \ncontinuing this kind of research and \nexpanding on the capability of vector \nsearch and its applications in things \nthat data scientists care about the \nfirst key idea is to understand the task \nof segmentation of analytics and data \nscience so in data science we typically \nhave a distribution of values of \nsomething that we care about now for the \nexample of twitter analytics i'm \ninterested in the number of impressions \nthat each of these tweets receive so \nhopefully i can gain insights into what \ntopics to tweet about what particular \nlanguage and \nfeatures like that that might lead to \ntweets that receive more impressions so \nfollowing the csv export of the tweets i \nplot my impressions in a histogram and i \ncan see the distribution of the \nimpressions so as i look at this i see \nmost of the tweets have you know in this \nkind of mid-level of impressions and \nthen we see some that go into having \nmany impressions although there are \nfewer of them so you know we're just \nplotting the the histogram bins of the \nnumber of impressions and then the count \nof how many tweets fall into each of \nthese buckets so when we have a \ndistribution of this the task of \nsegmentation is to try to take apart \nthis \nvisualization to see how it varies with \nrespect to splitting it on certain \nfeatures so as examples of these \nfeatures that we're splitting we might \nask questions like what time was the \ntweet sent say we sent a tweet in the \nmiddle of the night does that result in \nvery low impressions or say we you know \nsent our tweet right at 10 in the \nmorning on monday \ndoes that result in a successful tweet \nthen we might ask is there a url link in \nthe tweet does maybe trying to point \npeople off of twitter is that \nyou know causing the twitter algorithm \nto not promote our tweet or something \nlike that and that'll be our transition \nfrom understanding these \nsplitting on these symbolic attributes \ncompared to these vector attributes that \nare extracted from deep learning models \nfor segmentation \nso the first question i asked is what \ntime was the tweet sent so from the \ntweets i can extract this feature of \ntweets sent before 12 plot the \nimpressions of those tweets and then i \ncan look at the impressions on tweets \nsent after 12. \nand kind of one of the problems with \nthis is you see how the the count is \nthey're much more tweets sent after 12 \nand before 12 it's difficult to kind of \nautomatically extract some insight from \nthat question similarly we have the \nquestion of is there a url link in the \ntweet and looking also at the \ndistribution between these two values so \nthis example of splitting our data based \non the symbolic attributes that are \ncontained in the data \nthese kind of attributes like the time \nor extracting a boolean value from the \nurl clicks in this presentation we're \ntrying to see if we can split \nimpressions or whatever metric we care \nabout based on the semantics of the \ncontent itself and expand on \nsegmentation from symbolic attributes to \nvector representations of the high \ndimensional objects that the metrics are \ndescribing so the raw text of the tweet \nitself or as we'll also look at when \ndescribing other examples say \nmovie transcriptions podcast \ntranscriptions uh text and scientific \npaper or images of e-commerce products \nthis kind of data that we can form \nvector representations from and then \nsplit our analytics based on the \nclusters in this vector space so for \nexample without manually annotating the \ntweets we can segment them based on \ntheir vector distance to the phrases \nwe've a podcast we vva tutorial and ai \nweekly update to split the tweets based \non what they're about with with respect \nto these kinds of \ncategories without actually manually \nlabeling them we can similarly do this \nfor say natural language processing \ncomputer vision or say robotics we can \nuse these kinds of distances to these \nquery points to automatically form \ncategories and clusters that we can use \nto split the impressions of the of the \ntweets we perform segmentation to split \nthe metric that we care about like \nimpressions on tweets or say clicks on \nan ad and now what we want to do is see \nif we can segment these analytics based \non the semantics of these high \ndimensional data objects like raw text \nimages code even audio videos \nsay graph structure biological sequences \nand really anything can be encoded into \na vector representation like this and \nthen we form clusters of the vectors to \nsegment our analytics and see how these \nclusters vary with respect to the \nmetrics like impressions or views and so \non to summarize the first pillar of the \npresentation is about understanding \nsegmentation and data science we \nvisualize the distribution of our data \nto get a sense of it so for example we \nsee that the impressions on these tweets \nare roughly normally distributed and \nthen we ask questions with respect to \nthe features that we have like is this \ndistribution also the case for tweets \nthat are sent at say three in the \nmorning but now what we're looking at \ntrying to do is say what about tweets \nrelated to the the topic of deep \nlearning for robotics and we're not \ngoing to determine that a tweet is about \ndeep learning for robotics based on \nkeyword matching with say it contains \nthe exact phrase robotics or deep \nlearning for robotics we're going to try \nto encode tweets into a vector space as \nwell as the phrase deep learning for \nrobotics and use the nearest neighbor \nsearch to determine tweets that have the \nsemantic similarity with deep learning \nfor robotics and then use this to get a \nsense of the twitter impressions about \non tweets that are about that particular \ntopic of deep learning for robotics or \nsimilarly say deep learning for biology \nor all these different kinds of topics \nthat i've been exploring as i've been \nmaking content about topics in deep \nlearning the second key idea is to \nunderstand how we can represent real \nworld objects with vector \nrepresentations so we'll start by kind \nof looking at different ways of encoding \nthings so to say so looking at symbols \ncompared to vectors so some common \nsymbols are \ncategories so say we have \nlabels about vehicles and we have \nships trucks cars motorcycles and we use \na one index to denote which category \nthis particular thing is so say this one \nindicates that this is a an example of a \ncar vehicle so this is an example of how \nwe represent categories typically in \nthese one hot encoded vectors similarly \nwe have variables like numeric values \nlike how old someone is or \nyou know these metrics are numeric \nvalues like impressions these numeric \nvalues we can use thresholds like \ngreater than less than \nintervals to to segment our data and get \nsenses of it based on these numeric \nattributes and similarly we have boolean \nvalues true or false \nvectors are say n dimensional objects \nwhere we have values in each index of \nthe vector that that represents \nsomething so this 0.1 0.8 0.34 this is a \nvector that \nyou would say it say has a direction a \nmagnitude but usually we normalize these \nvectors so they all have a uniform \nmagnitude but it's really kind of the \ndirection that is captured that it's \nhard to kind of reason about direction \nof these high dimensional vectors but \nthat's sort of what we're looking at \nwhen we're looking at comparing the \ndistances between these vectors as we'll \nexplain further in the presentation so \nthe key idea behind vector search is \nwe're using these vectors to represent \nhigh dimensional \ndata objects that are otherwise really \ndifficult to kind of compress into a \nsingle representation and having this \nkind of flexibility with this \nn-dimensional vector interface lets us \nstore the semantics of the \nhigh-dimensional objects so say we take \npictures like these high resolution \nimages of golden retriever puppies and \nsome computer vision model is say gonna \nthere are two things that generally \nwe're looking at maybe the computer \nvision model is going to classify \nwhether this is a dog or a cat and \nbefore it makes that final binary \nprediction it's going to have this \nlatent representation of the dog at say \nlayer 8 of the deep neural network and \nthen we're then we're going to extract \nthis vector representation to represent \nthe puppy image overall and store it in \nour vector search database like what we \nv8 is but another way of doing this it's \nbecoming more and more popular is to \ndirectly optimize for the vector \nrepresentation itself so as we'll \nexplore further in in this particular \nsegment of the talk we're looking at \npredicting these vector representations \nfor different images and trying to make \nsay positive pairs like these two golden \nretriever puppies similar to each other \nand say dissimilar to other images like \na brand new car image or something like \nthat that would be different from these \ngolden retriever puppies so we'll return \nto the details of exactly how deep \nneural networks are producing vector \nrepresentations but let's stay a little \nfurther on what we're doing with these \nvectors once we have the vectors so say \nwe have some deep learning model that \nmaps from images to vectors once we have \nthese vectors we can use vector distance \nto determine semantic similarity so a \ncommon vector distance metric is l2 \ndistance you just loop through each \nindex in the vector and then you just \nsquare the difference of the two sum \nthat up and that's the l2 distance so \nsay we have these three dimensional \nvectors that describe \nthis puppy this puppy and then let's \npretend that there's an image of an \nairplane so we would take the l2 \ndistances between the two puppies and we \nsee you know 4 minus 2 squared is 4 plus \n1 squared 1 plus 1 squared 1 is 6 and \nthen we'd also do the vector distance \nbetween the first puppy and the airplane \nso the vector distance between the \nvector 4 8 10 and 1 20 20 \nis a much higher number than six so we \ndetermined that the first puppy is much \nmore semantically similar to puppy two \nthan the airplane based on this vector \ndistance calculation and there are a few \ndifferent distance metrics that we can \nlook at as we kind of mentioned \ndirection and vectors and say cosine \ndistance angular distance there are a \nfew ways of looking at distances with \nvectors but generally it has this kind \nof form where you're comparing \nindexes of the vector with each other \nso with these kind of kinds of vector \ndistances we can determine semantic \nsimilarity but we can also cluster the \nvectors using say common clustering \nalgorithms like uh we could do things \nlike k-means if it was in a lower \nalready in a low dimensional space but \ncommonly we do things like tsne pca umap \nprojections from the 300 dimensions say \ninto this three-dimensional space to get \na visualization of of our cluster so we \nsee how we have the chicken the image of \nthe chicken the wolf the dog the cat \nthey're all kind of similar in the \nvector space whereas they're dissimilar \nfrom say this google and apple logo or \nactual \napple and then banana so we see how we \nhave these clusters in the semantic \nspace and so this is just the key idea \nto this presentation is understanding \nthat we take a bunch of tweets from my \ntwitter analytics data and then we put \nthem into this embedding space such that \nwe have say the tweets about computer \nvision topics the tweets about natural \nlanguage processing topics and then we \ncan further look at and then we take the \ncluster out extract the impressions data \nurl clicks then we have a new interface \nfor looking at the data science of \nseeing how these metrics are distributed \nbefore graduating from this slide it may \nbe worthwhile to stay a little more on \nthis idea of why the talk is titled \nvector search for data science say \nrather than vector clustering for data \nscience so when we have these clusters \nit might not really be useful to just \nlook at the cluster and imagine it's a \ncluster of like 500 objects or something \nlike that we want to kind of have \nsemantic names for the clusters so say \nwe had done the search query animals and \nthen animals takes us to this cluster of \nnearest neighbors that interface for \nsegmenting the analytics is i think more \nproductive than just trying to just take \nthe clusters and say do the k-means or \nyou just have these clusters that are \ncloser to these centroid points and then \njust doing your analytics from there i \nthink it's more useful to be remembering \nthat vector search part of it where you \nhave animals \nbrands or fruit and using those search \nquery points to provide like a semantic \ntitle to the cluster so to dig into this \nidea of vector representations of \nobjects a little further you might be \ninterested in how these index positions \ninfluence the representation of these \nobjects can we say that say index zero \nsolely determines how much of a brand if \nwe're saying these are this is the brand \nclustered is say index zero of this \nvector is the density of that particular \nindex determine how much this is that \nand the the thing about this is it's a \npretty interesting kind of field of \nresearch and deep learning this idea of \nsay disentangled representation learning \nwhere we can say what each of these uh \nindex positions and codes and there's \nbeen some interesting research \nmultimodal neurons from open ai really \nstands out as an interesting exploration \ninto these latent representations from \ndeep learning models but generally we \ncan't just \nconvert it from the vector \nrepresentation right back into symbolic \nrepresentations of what each index \nrepresents rather we kind of have this \nuh entanglement of the whole \nrepresentation and so we need to kind of \nrely on these vector distance \ncalculations rather than kind of \nextracting is this index say how much of \na \nfruit it is and so on so another \ninteresting question maybe is how much \ncan we compress these vectors and in my \nview one of the most interesting things \nthat we've done at we've eat is look at \nthis binary passage retrieval idea where \nyou can compress \nthe values in the indexes from say 32 \nfloating point values to binary values \nwhich is shown with this green being one \nwhite being zero to just kind of \nillustrate a binary vector and \nsurprisingly you can still get \nimpressive retrieval when you do this \nlevel of compression and there are other \nideas like product quantization and say \nlocality sensitive hashing that try to \nsay compress the 384 part of it to \n32d and one of the most rewarding \nexperiences i've had at wv8 was to \ninterview eddie and dillocker on his \nwork in \na n benchmarks and benchmarking vector \nsearch at large scales and seeing how \ncomputing these vector distance \ncalculations using efficient data \nstructures how that scales so if you're \ninterested in these kinds of questions \nlike the performance of vector search \nand exact numbers for that with respect \nto how many vectors you have the \ndimensionality of the vectors and then \nkind of high level ideas like the \ndistributions of the vectors themselves \nyou might be interested in checking out \nour webva podcast so i hope that was a \npretty clear overview of what we do with \nthese vectors so we have these vectors \nthat are particular kind of way of \nrepresenting something \nwe convert from high dimensional \nunstructured data into vector \nrepresentations we have say vector \ndistance calculations that form semantic \nclusters \nwe explore what's in these vectors and \nask questions about how much we can \ncompress them and how much these how \nmuch the performance varies with respect \nto the attributes of our data set and \nthe vectors themselves so now let's dive \ninto the question of how did we get \nthese vectors to begin with so this is a \nvery influential paper sentence sentence \nembeddings using siamese birt networks \nthat explains this idea of having \nsiamese twin tower networks where we \nhave a copy of the same neural network \nthat produces representation u and \nrepresent rotation b uh both of these \nbird neural networks share the same \nweights commonly there are some \nframeworks where it's an exponential \nmoving average and \nit's things like that but generally it's \na siamese copy of the same network and \nthey both produce vector representations \nof two different inputs so sentence a \ngoes through this copy of the network \nand sentence b goes through this other \ncopy of the network and now we compare \nthe vector distance between the \nrepresentation u and the representation \nv and we have this loss function back \npropagate into the neural network \nweights of burt on both sides to update \nthe neural networks to produce better \npredictions for these two sentence a and \nsentence b so the key thing is then \ndetermining well should sentence a and \nsentence b are they positive pairs or \nnegative pairs should they be \nclose in the vector distance space so to \ngive more of an example of this we \nsample these points from data sets like \nwikipedia \nso often what we're doing is we're \nlooking at heuristics to self-supervise \nthe a and b positive or a and b negative \nscoring such that we can do this \nrepresentation alignment from internet \nscale data and a lot of these as we get \ninto this idea of zero shot pre-trained \nmodels they're trained on internet scale \ndata such that they \nhave this amazing generalization \nproperty so we start off with things \nlike this query point so here's an \nexample of a paragraph from wikipedia \nthat describes the miami heat mba \nbasketball team now what we determine is \nthat the positive pair is the next \nparagraph in the wikipedia article so \nnow we led by dwayne wade and following \na trade for former nba mvp shaquille \no'neal this next paragraph continues to \ndescribe the miami heat basketball team \nso we'd want to take these two \nparagraphs from wikipedia and then \nencode them into a into vectors that \nminimize the semantic \ndistance between these two a vector \ndistance between these two and we also \nhave negatives like this article about \ndeep learning so we would want to have a \nclose semantic representation of these \ntwo paragraphs about the miami heat and \nthen a dissimilar representation of this \nparagraph about deep learning in \naddition to this idea of using heuristic \nlabeling like saying that the following \nparagraph is going to be a positive pair \nof the \nwikipedia article we also look at this \nnoising or masking interface to form \npositive pairs so data deveck is a very \ninfluential framework showing how we can \ndo this positive pair construction for \nreally any kind of data domain because \nthis idea of applying a noise mass can \ngeneralize to any kind of data that you \nmight have so for example we take an \nimage we apply this mask to it we have a \nspeech file audio file and we apply this \nto it language mask out with and and \nthen try to align these two \nrepresentations so \na couple of ways of looking at how we \nform these sentence a sentence be image \na image b video a video b \nany kind of thing for these two things \nthat we're trying to encode into the \nvector spaces \nso that's how we construct the \noptimization \ntask to optimize the weights and thus \noptimize the vector representations of \ndata \nso as you're looking at this you might \nbe intimidated by this idea of do we \nneed to train our own models are we \ngoing to need to optimize a model with \nthese contrastive learning loss \nfunctions in order to take advantage of \nvector search for data science and \nwhat's the one of the most exciting \ntrends behind this whole thing is the \nanswer to that is increasingly looking \nlike no and there are many pre-trained \nmodels that work well for a very broad \nrange of data so from being trained on \nwikipedia or say \nquery passage pairs in the ms marco data \nset we're seeing that models trained on \ndata sets like that are able to \ngeneralize and produce reasonable \nrepresentations for say my twitter data \nand things like that so if you're \ninterested in this \nsentence transformers from hugging face \nis an excellent place to get started on \nlooking at these models that produce \nvector representations off the shelf for \nall kinds of data domains to summarize \nthe second key takeaway from this \npresentation is to understand vector \nrepresentations of data \nstarting with what the vectors are \nthemselves and understanding that we can \ntake all sorts of things like images \ntext or code snippets and map them into \nvectors with predictions from deep \nlearning models those deep learning \nmodels are trained to maximize semantic \nsimilarity between uh between each of \nthe positive pairs and they're usually \ntrained on massive collections of data \nlike all of wikipedia or going even \nfurther for internet scale data like \nlike on that kind of order and because \nthey're trained on such a massive amount \nof data we often don't need to train the \nmodels ourselves for particular data \ndomains to have a reasonable zero shot \nperformance or a adaptation to our \nparticular problem the third key \ntakeaway of the presentation is vector \nsegmentation which brings together these \nideas of segmentation and data science \nwhere we split the metric that we care \nabout based on other attributes that we \nmight have like what time we send the \ntweet or whether the tweet has a url \nlink in it and also this idea of vector \nrepresentations of data so to tying \nthese ideas together we saw how we can \nproduce vector representations of text \nimages code audio video all sorts of \ndata can be produced into one of these \nvector representations through the \ninference of a deep learning model and \nthen we connected it to this twitter \nexample where \nsay we want to split out the tweets \nbased on the distance to we va podcast \nvva tutorial or ai weekly update to get \na sense of how these things \ncluster and how they're semantically \nrelated so in this section i'd like to \nmaybe just quickly describe some \nadditional examples in addition to the \ntweet categories that i think hopefully \nwill just kind of cement this idea of \nhow we can apply \nvector representations to segment \nanalytics and apply vector search in \ndata science so we'll start with \neveryone's favorite task of house \nhunting \nhouses in databases like these real \nestate platforms they typically have \nsymbols like the number of bedrooms a \nnumber of bathrooms \nsquare feet these would be \nnumeric values and then say we have \ncities that we might represent as a \ncategorical feature or something like \nthat so we have you know these kinds of \nsymbols that we could split the houses \nsay we want to split the prices of \nhouses and we want to use these \nattributes like the number of bedrooms \nthe number of bathrooms to split the \ndistribution of the prices of houses \nwith these vector representations we can \nhave vectors that encode the visual \naesthetic of the house say the \nneighborhood structure and this is in \nthat idea of graph structured \nrepresentations which kind of at the \nbottom of the list this graph structured \nembeddings you see things like graph \nneural networks or algorithms like deep \nwalk and node to vect this idea of \nconverting graph structure into vector \nrepresentations as well is also \nsomething we can we can do and is \nbecoming increasingly easier to do as \nwell so we can encode the graph \nstructure of the neighborhoods and then \nwe also just have a more flexible \ninterface to define features with text \nso compared to symbols where say we have \na feature that is a \npool does it have a pool one or zero \nboolean value whereas with text we can \njust kind of describe the features of \nthe house in this flexible interface and \nthen encode it in the vector \nrepresentation \nthat can encode all these things and \nthen segment things like the prices of \nhouses based on visual style or \nneighborhood characteristics that help \nus segment the houses by going deeper \ninto \nmeaning and semantics of what makes \nmakes up these real-world objects of \nhouses so similarly with e-commerce \nproducts we have symbols like what kind \nof e-commerce product it is like if it's \napparel particularly we might have shoes \nt-shirt pants or say colors whereas with \nvectors we could have a representation \nof the visual style of the products \nthemselves with movies we also have \ngenre symbols like children action or \nsci-fi where vectors can encode say take \na description of the movie maybe reviews \nof the movie to encode things like the \nthemes characters story lines these \nparticular kinds of nuances that make \nmovies different from one another within \ngenres and without requiring heavy \nmanual symbolic tagging \nin scientific papers i think is one of \nthe most interesting \nthings to explore with this as well \nwhere say symbols separate papers like \nthat are related to biology or machine \nlearning whereas vectors can really \nencode the nuance of the ideas contained \nin the papers and maybe the writing \nstyle as well and then finally with \nmusic i think is another very \ninteresting thing where \nwe have these high level tags like hip \nhop or dance \nbut vectors can encode sort of the \nmusical style and i'm not an expert on \nmusic but things like this could be \nencoded with vector representations \nusing this kind of way of thinking so \nhopefully these examples helped further \nclarify this idea of how vector \nrepresentations what vector \nrepresentations can help us capture in \nour data to \nsegment it and better understand it and \nhopefully going through this list maybe \nmade it more clear how to apply this to \nyour own data sets so we'll end this \nsection on vector segmentation with the \nfollowing quote from francois chile in \nhis book the second edition of deep \nlearning with python \nthat's the magic of deep learning \nturning meaning into vectors then into \ngeometric spaces and then incrementally \nlearning complex geometric \ntransformations that map one space to \nanother all you need are spaces of \nsufficiently high dimensionality in \norder to capture the full scope of the \nrelationships found in the original data \nso there's a little more to this quote \nthan just turning meaning into vectors \ndescribing how we have \nseveral layers of this kind of \ntensor space processing and these \nnon-linear transformations between \neach space to the next space as you \npass through a sequential neural network \nbut the key idea \nin what we're interested in is this idea \nof turning meaning into vectors and the \nmagic of deep learning and being able to \ndo so and do so for so many different \ndata modalities and use cases \nto summarize section 3 brings together \nthe ideas of the first takeaway in \nsegmentation and data science and the \nsecond takeaway of understanding vector \nrepresentations of data so vector \nrepresentations which are also the also \ncommonly called embeddings enable an \ninterface to split analytics based on \nthe semantics of the content itself and \nthis content could be text images code \naudio videos it's really up to your \nimagination to thinking about what \nyou're going to encode in these vector \nspaces so now that we've gone through \nthe background of what segmentation and \ndata science is and how we can use \nvector representations to facilitate \nwith segmentation i'm super excited to \nshow this example of twitter analytics \nmining with the we v8 vector search \nengine and how we can use vector \nsegmentation and twitter analytics \nthrough we v8 so as shown previously \nwith the export csv twitter analytics \ngives you a csv data set like this where \nyou get the the text of the tweets \nthemselves as well as the time the tweet \nwas sent and then the metrics like \nimpressions engagements and so on so in \nthis example we're going to be using the \ntext column to vectorize it with a \nsentence transformer and then we're \ngoing to use this for nearest neighbor \nsearch to segment the content of our \ntweets such as whether it's about the \nebay podcast coding tutorials or topics \nlike natural language processing \ncomputer vision maybe even research \nniches like self-supervised learning or \ndata augmentation and so on to get a \nsense of how the semantics of this \ndifferent content \nsegments the impressions or url clicks \nand these kinds of ideas so following \nthis schema that you see \nin this picture \nthis is how we upload this into wev8 \nthrough python so in python we create \nthis dictionary where we have classes \nand then we name our class tweet we \ndescribe the class tweet analytics and \nthen we list the properties of the tweet \nand we'll get in further to this graph \ndata model of we've eight and more of \nwhat you can do with this but here's the \nthe very basic of \ndefining the property that has the text \nof the tweet and then say you have the \nauthor which is another text \nand you would add the impressions \nengagements so on as you fill out this \ndictionary \nchanging the data type to say number or \nboolean and so on and telling wva not to \nbother with vectorizing uh text columns \nlike author be as we'll see later in the \nexample we're going to add tweets not \njust for myself but other people not to \njump ahead but we want to tell we've a \nto only vectorize this particular column \nand we do that with this skip parameter \nin the text event transformers module so \nhere's a quick overview of the schema in \nthe python and uh so what i did and i \nthink this is really interesting is go \nfrom google collab notebooks to the \nweev8 cloud service and there are many \nother ways to upload data into wev8 but \ni think this for data scientists is so \naccessible the way that you have these \nthis jupyter notebook interface hosted \non google collab \nand then putting data into the vva cloud \nservice all of this can just be done \nwith very little real uh \nor challenging skills with respect to \nthe engineering of setting up all these \ndifferent cloud services we can just \nkind of with a few clicks go from google \ncollab to the vva cloud service to host \nthis example so with that said with the \ntwitter data hosted on the vga cloud \nservice let's jump into the wev8 console \nand do some graphql queries on my tweets \nthe screen is showing the we v8 console \nthat has my twitter data in it one \nuseful way to quickly get a sense of \nthis is to click on the schema button \nand see the schema of the data that this \nthat this console is currently pointing \nto so we see how we have \nthe tweet text property \nwe have the author of the tweet \nwe have what hour the tweet was sent we \nhave all these properties that describe \neach tweet in the data set so the first \nquery we're going to do is to do the \nthe highlight of the thing the semantic \nnearest neighbor search to concepts like \nnatural language processing or computer \nvision so \nto do this we use the \nget syntax we passed in his argument the \ntweet class and then to this we pass in \nthe argument of the near text search \nso so in your text we pass as argument \nthe particular query that we want to \nmake so in this case \nand i'm sorry that you're watching me \nkind of remember how to do this but in \nthis argument we pass in \nwhat we want to search for so say \nnatural language processing \nand to kind of jump around in the \ntutorial a little bit the next thing is \ngoing to be \ngetting tweets other than just my own so \nin order to just search for my tweets \nfrom now we're going to also add this \nwhere filter \nwhere we add this argument path \nauthor being the property that we want \nto have this symbolic filter on with our \nreturn results \noperator equal \nand then value text \nmy twitter handle which is c short and \n30. so from there we have our \nfilter on the tweets and then we tell it \nwhich uh attributes of the tweets we \nwant to see in the return list so let's \nsee the tweet text itself to sanity \ncheck this thing then we'll get the \nimpressions and then let's also say see \nurl click so so this forms our uh query \nin graphql in the vva console so when we \nclick search it's going to find the \nnearest neighbors to natural language \nprocessing \nthat i've authored and then \nand then return also the tweet text \nitself the number of impressions and the \nurl clicks on the tweet \nso we send that query \nand uh so we see the top result is stack \noverflow down really looking forward to \nlanguage models that can answer \nquestions about python so pretty related \nand i guess so kind of looking through \nthis i think maybe the most interesting \nthing to quickly focus on \nwould be to understand that it doesn't \nhave to have the exact keyword match \nnatural language processing it can still \nkind of capture the semantics of that \neven if it doesn't directly \nask for that so to also kind of just \nsearch through this we can try a wee va \npodcast and see what's returned in this \ncase a lot of the tweets do \nsay we va podcasts directly \nmaybe we could do just deep learning \nbroadly \nbut anyways i think from this you get a \nsense of \nyou can decide what you want to \nreturn from the properties of the thing \nof the \nclass you have this near text filter \nwhere you pass in the argument through \nthis interface and you can add \nadditional filters this way in addition \nto the we vvade console we can also wrap \nup the graphql queries in a python \nsyntax to send these queries in python \nthen access the nearest neighbors in \npython to produce the visualizations of \nthe impression splits based on say we've \na podcast we've a tutorials an ai weekly \nupdate or also say natural language \nprocessing computer vision again the \nsame kind of idea so this is the syntax \nof looking at how we can wrap up this \ngraphql query into a python uh api so we \nhave the dictionary we have the concepts \nquery \nwe do the the get query we pass in the \nclass name tweet the attributes we want \nto see tweet text impressions then we \nexecute the search and then we index the \nreturn data object so from that return \ndata object we can put it into say \nseaborn matplotlib to visualize a \ndistribution of impressions based on \nthese different filters achieving this \nidea of segmenting our analytics based \non what the tweet was actually about so \nfollowing this analysis of segmenting \ntweets based on semantic content and \ndistance to queries like we a podcast we \nvva tutorials or topics again natural \nlanguage processing computer vision here \nare some additional questions that i'm \nasking about exploring twitter analytics \nwith we v8 and seeing what else we can \ndo and i'll continue this discussion in \nthe fifth section of this talk under \nresearch questions and discussions so \none question i wanted to ask is this \nconcept of have i tweeted something like \nthis before and trying to have some kind \nof \nsay pre-flight checklist before sending \na tweet to get a sense of how tweets \nlike this have performed in the past so \nuh this is just showing putting the \nexact same tweet into the semantic space \nand seeing the uh return nearest \nneighbors just to get a quick sanity \ncheck of what this kind of thing looks \nlike \nbut probably more interestingly than \njust have i tweeted something like this \nbefore might be to ask you know who in \nmy say network or in my particular \nindustry like machine learning has \ntweeted something like this uh recently \nso in order to explore this question i \naggregated a list of people who've come \non the wvva podcast \ngoing through the we vva podcast guests \nand going through their twitter \nusernames to hit the tweepy api and add \ntheir recent tweets into this database \nto have this semantic search to see what \nall these people are tweeting about and \nsee if \nthey have similar interests to the thing \nthat i'm interested in right now so the \nfirst step in this was compiling the \nlist of vva podcast guest twitter \nusernames \nthen hitting the tweepy api like this \nusing the \nkeys you get from twitter api and then \ngrabbing 100 of the most recent tweets \nfrom our from our uh i think roughly 14 \nor 15 we gave a podcast guest so another \ninteresting thing with we've yet is i \ncan use this same schema just populating \nthe tweet text the author and the likes \neven though i don't have say the \nimpressions or url clicks data i can \nstill just populate these \nproperties and add it into our pretty \nflexible data schema so now that we've \nadded these using the additional \ntwitter users let's see some graphql \nqueries with semantic search so we're \nback in the we evade console and this \ntime we're going to be querying all of \nthe we vva podcast guests to see if \nanyone has been tweeting about the \nparticular topic of generative art \nso in it's the same exact query from \nbefore we just have the get filter \ntweet and then from the tweet we want to \nget the tweet text \nand let's say the author and then we add \nour near text filter to it \nlike this where we have concepts \nand then \ngenerative art \ncool so this is how we form our query \nand then we send it and now we're \nsearching through all the authors on the \neva podcast and seeing if they've been \ntweeting about this concept of \ngenerative art so we see \nhan zhao has been tweeting a bit \ngenerative art is a creative process we \nsee a lot of say exact keyword matching \nwe see some ai generated artwork so it \nisn't exactly identical to our key \nphrase but it still pro props it up to \none of the top results we see bob \ntweeting uh generative models like dolly \nfor music are around the corner so \ngenerative music art \nso anyway so this is the idea where we \ncan \nyou know have these semantic searches we \ncan add a bunch of authors from twit \ntwitter users and \nuse this in order to do the semantic \nsearch about what people are tweeting \nabout which i think could be a really \ninteresting tool and i'm really excited \nto continue exploring this application \nif you're interested in playing with \nweaviate yourself and sending some \nqueries out we have a live demo of \nwikipedia that you can explore so before \ndiving into the console itself with the \nwikipedia data let's look at the schema \nfor this wikipedia example so there's \none key thing that i've left out of the \ntwitter tutorial that is one of the most \nexciting parts of wva generally which is \nthe graph like data model so in the \nwikipedia example we have articles and \nthen we have paragraphs of the articles \nin the articles as two separate classes \nso the article has the property of the \ntitle of the article say miami heat to \nreference the example from earlier and \nthen each paragraph in the article is \nrepresented as a separate class that has \nthe title of the \narticle i believe and then the content \nin the paragraph itself and then the \norder that it appears in the wikipedia \narticle so for example coming back to \nthe positive sampling with the miami \nheat articles this would be the first \norder because this is the first \nparagraph in this article about the \nmiami heat and then this is the \nsecond paragraph in that particular \narticle \nso this allows us to create these \nrelations have named relations between \nobjects and also we see this recursive \nrelation where say the the miami heat \narticle links to the nba and then we \nhave this recursive relation back to the \nmba article so i'm going to get into \nmore on this in a little bit about how \nwe could expand the twitter example to \nhave this graph like data model and \nintroduce some additional classes but \nlet's get into the wikipedia example to \nhave a quick sense of this in action so \nhere we are in the uva console for the \nwikipedia example we can check the \nschema see the classes we have the \narticle a wikipedia article with a title \nand cross references \nand then we also have the paragraph \nwhich is the wikipedia paragraph and \nwithin that we have the \ncontent which is the thing that is \nvectorized with the transformers so this \nis an automatically populated query from \nthe web link that's in the description \nof this video to check out this \nwikipedia example \nand so we're introducing a couple of new \nthings from the twitter example so \nfirstly in addition to the near text \nfilter there's also a question answering \nfilter in we've eight and i think it's \nkind of out of the scope of this topic \nof this talk to completely dive into \nwhat question answering is but basically \nwhat it's going to do is it's going to \nretrieve the nearest neighbor content to \nthe question and then it's going to \nclassify \nusing a supervised learning model \nclassify the answer to this question \nwithin the content \nbut the other thing that we see is the \ncross reference between the paragraph \nand then in article and then the title \nso this is how we do that cross \nreference to answer the question within \nwikipedia of who was stanley kubrick so \nto recap wev88 is a vector search \ndatabase rather than a library such as \nfacebook's face or annoy from spotify \nthis means that wev8 has the approximate \nnearest neighbor search for doing vector \nsearch with an absolutely enormous \ncollection of vectors but it also has \ndatabase functionality like create read \nupdate delete support and lets you \nsafely secure and persist your vectors \nwhich is pretty important when you have \na massive amount of vectors and then we \nsaw how we va has a graph like data \nmodel we saw the example with wikipedia \nof how you can use the graph data model \nto organize data in this way we can \nimagine building on the twitter example \nby say also linking these images by \nhaving a has image thing and it's \ngenerally such an interesting property \nof a way of combining say multimodal \ntext image data but also kind of \nheterogeneous data say we have a tweet \nand it links to an article then we have \nan article which is also text but we \nhave this other way of representing that \narticle object so if you want to get \nstarted with wev8 i highly recommend \nchecking out the quick start guide under \nwe v8 if you want to get started running \nwith the demo data set and understanding \nhow to set this up and eventually \ngraduating to uploading your own data \nsets into we vva so to summarize the \nfourth key section on using we've a for \ntwitter analytics we see how returning \nto the whole theme of the talk we can \nsegment the impressions on twitter based \non the content of the tweet without \nmanual labeling we can do it with these \nvector representations that we get from \na pre-trained sentence transformer that \nhasn't been say optimized in my tweets \nor really twitter in general \nand then further we saw wev8 a vector \nsearch database and we saw how we can \nuse it to store and search through \nsemantic vector embeddings of data the \nfifth section presents some research \nquestions we're exploring and a \ndiscussion around this project so here \nare three important research questions \nand general directions that we're \nexploring that will help with projects \nlike this and this general idea of \nvector search and then also their \napplications and things like \nsegmentation as outlined in the \npresentation so the first key question \nis should i fine-tune my embedding model \nor my \nmodel that produces the vector \nrepresentations so early in the \npresentation i i claim that no you don't \nneed to you can use these pre-trained \nsentence transformer models but this is \nstill a pretty active area of research \nwe do see a very impressive zero shot \ngeneralization from these models and it \nprobably can give you a pretty good \nretrieval from your data but there are \nall sorts of things that are in the \nworks uh say sparse fine-tuning that let \nyou fine-tune more efficiently \nthe continued development of these \noff-the-shelf models of course and then \nsay hybrid approaches where we combine \nthis \nvector model with say \nthe keyword bm25 tf idf those kinds of \nfeatures is pretty particular to text \nthat particular approach but this kind \nof fusion of features is is seeing a lot \nof interest in how we produce the \nretrieval list and combining the \nfeatures from \nthe vectors and then also this bm25 \nalgorithm so there is a very active line \nof research and just understanding \ncontrastive learning generally i don't \nthink contrastive learning is a \nit's kind of seems like a newer thing \nthat's emerging say in computer vision \nwe had sim clr moco and people started \nreally taking that show on the road to \ntext as well and we're seeing things \nlike sentence transformers so i still \nthink there's a lot of opportunities to \nexplore how we train these models that \nare trained to produce vector \nrepresentations the second key thing is \nthis idea around large scale vector \nsearch and how we form the the how we do \nthis vector search at the say billion \nscales imagine we have billions of \ntweets in our database and that's where \nthese things called approximate nearest \nneighbor a n algorithms come into play \nand i think this is a really fascinating \narea of research to study particularly \nif you're interested in things like data \nstructures and computer science and then \nfinally the key topic that i really want \nto emphasize and is i think very \nrelevant to this particular project of \ntwitter analytics is how does vector \nsearch differ from classification or \nregression models and this idea of \nretrieval augmented \nsay learning \nso let's start with this idea of vector \nsearch versus regression on impressions \nso imagine we have a model where you \ntype in a tweet and then it will use \nyour data to just predict how many \nimpressions this tweet would receive i \nmean if if it has high accuracy you'd be \nlike well sure this this is useful i \nsuppose and then you tweak your craft \nyour tweet modify some phrases until you \ncan get this number to be as high as \npossible but instead of just having this \nblind regression model we might want to \nhave a vector search model where again \nwe put in our tweet and then we get the \nnearest neighbors to tweets we've sent \nbefore to give us this sense of what is \nthis tweet i'm about to send similar to \nbut what retrieval augmented \nclassification is about is combining \nboth of these things so the model is \ngoing to retrieve the nearest neighbor \ntweets in the input as it makes a \nprediction on how many impressions this \nindividual tweet will receive then we \nhave options where we could say perturb \nthe input to have that interpretability \nand see how \na perceived change in nearest neighbors \nwould change the impression prediction \nand overall it just gives us more of an \ninterface to see what is influencing \nthis prediction why is it predicting \nthis amount of repression impressions \nrather than just this kind of blind \ninput output mapping so to continue on \nthis discussion this talk was inspired \nby the twitter analytics data and trying \nto see what kinds of insights we can \nmine from it and how these new tools in \nvector search can help us gain \nadditional insights from our twitter \nanalytics data as well as maybe also \nconnecting to the broader scope of what \neveryone's tweeting about and because \nyou can still access say the like \nretweet count which can also help you \nget a sense of performance with tweeting \nabout these kinds of topics so generally \nwe want to ask questions like you know \nshould i post this to begin with would \nthis be you know would this just be a \nbad tweet to post and \nsave yourself the embarrassment sort of \nwhen you do that kind of thing and just \ngenerally thinking well maybe it's a \ngood tweet but there's just a particular \ntime to post it coming back to the \nsymbolic questions but then kind of this \nentanglement of the tweet itself what \ntime is best to post this particular \ntweet and then you know the phrasing \nit's this entanglement between the \nsymbolic attributes of the time to post \nit as well as the kind of the content \nitself if you want to dig deeper into \nthat and then we want to maybe expand \nfrom individual analysis to team \nanalysis and say you know how are \naggregating the data from our entire \nteam is anyone tweeted like something \nlike this recently who on our team would \nbe best fit to tell the story and what \ntopics should we be tweeting about is \nsay a lot of these um \nyou know a lot of these content \nstrategies have a few different topics \nthat they could explore and should it \nmay be time to double down on a \nparticular thing like say \nfine-tuning retrieval models or a n \nbenchmarks all these topics which ones \nshould we be tweeting about so these are \nsome of the questions that i was seeking \nto explore in this twitter project and i \nhope you found this interesting so to \nsummarize the general idea is how can we \nimprove these systems and what looks \npromising with respect to the particular \nideas of improving these systems say \nideas like fine tuning more approximate \nnearest neighbor research to understand \nhow we can do this at larger scales and \nthis general idea of retrieval augmented \nmodeling to summarize his talk on vector \nsearch for data scientists we first \nlooked at the idea of segmentation and \ndata science how we can split metrics \nlike impressions based on values of \ndifferent attributes like what time the \ntweet was posted or whether it has a url \nin it in order to see the distributions \nand see the differences and \ndistributions based on these values then \nwe saw this idea of vector \nrepresentations of data and how we can \nrepresent say text images and code with \nvectors and then in the third section on \nvector segmentation \nhopefully the additional examples made \nit a little more clear how we can \ncombine these ideas of vector \nrepresentations and then uh segmenting \nour analytics based on the \nthe content of the data itself finally \nwe looked at the we've ate example for \ntwitter analytics i really hope you \nfound this interesting and then finally \nwe explored some research questions and \ndiscussion around this idea of vector \nsearch for data science as well as this \napplication for social media analytics \nif you're interested in we've aid and \nthese ideas around vector search please \nconnect with us on the we vvate slack \nchannel or our youtube channel we vv8 \nvector search engine \non the youtube channel as well as \nspotify i'm the host of the we v8 \npodcast where we have a lot of \ninteresting guests who are doing things \nin research around vector search or \nbuilding applications with wev8 and i \nreally enjoy these conversations so i \nhope you do as well and finally you can \ncheck us out on twitter at wev8.io \nfinally i would like to give a special \nthank you to sebastian woodaleck in \nadvising and counseling the development \nof this presentation as well as svetlana \nsmelly nova for the help with the visual \nstyling i'm so grateful for this help \nand putting this together and it really \nmeans a lot to me and in addition to \neveryone currently watching this video \nthank you so much for watching the \npresentation i really hope it made a \ncompelling argument about vector surge \nfor data science and this idea of vector \nsegmentation and hopefully this twitter \nanalytics project was somewhat of an \ninteresting way to understand this \nconcept so thanks again \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Vector Search for Data Scientists - Weaviate at ODSC London 2022", "path": "", "link":
