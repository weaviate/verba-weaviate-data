{"text": "Thank you so much for watching the Weaviate podcast! We are super excited to host Sam Bean from You.com! As well as ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nchecking out another episode of the \nwevia podcast this is going to be a \nsuper fun discussion we're talking about \nyou.com the spark connector with \nweeviate and generally billion scale Big \nData Technologies and we V8 and all \nthese exciting things around search \ninterfaces and so on so firstly I'm so \nexcited to welcome Zane and John for the \nfirst time on the web podcast thanks so \nmuch for joining the podcast guys \nhey everyone \nthanks Tony \nawesome so I'm also super excited to \nwelcome our external guest uh Sam Bean \nuh Sam is working on you.com Sam thank \nyou so much for joining the podcast and \nuh can you tell us a little bit about \nwhat you.com is and um yeah maybe we \ncould just start from there \nyeah thanks for having me \num so you.com is a um a newer search \nengine it is a \num kind of started as like a a play on \nhitting the niche between \npersonalization and privacy \num we've since evolved the the mission \nconsiderably and just recently we kind \nof announced uh the latest \num big kind of press that we're making \nin the search space which is kind of \ndemocratizing search and what we're \ncalling the open platform and so this is \nkind of like a mixture of some developer \ntooling uh DSL and it allows basically \nthird-party developers to create \num hook up their data and create search \nwidgets and applications as we call them \num that can show up uh natively on on \nour search results page so \num we kind of you just tell us like a \nlittle bit about what keywords it should \nshow up for and we handle like the \nranking and the retrieval and and \nrendering all of that and so really \ngreat discovery tool for third-party \ndevelopers who want to kind of plug into \na search engine so it seems like the the \nwhole kind of search interface is being \nredesigned at u.com in addition to of \ncourse like the retrieval technology can \nyou tell me about like more about the \nwidgets and sort of how you're thinking \nabout how people interface with search \nengines might want to obviously like you \ncan generate an image you you have these \nthings for you know having the code \nassistant tool you tell me about the \nthinking behind the interface yeah sure \nso I think that we've seen apps kind of \ntake a more prevalent role in the search \nspace like you probably haven't called \nthem that on on your your main players \nin this first search space like Google \nor Bing but you you've seen them like \nyour side panel Wikipedia panes \num those are kind of all things that we \ncall an app which is basically just a \nway to take our search data and curate \nit and decorate it in such a way to kind \nof give it like a special presentation \nand enrich the user experience a little \nbit more than kind of your your standard \nBlue Links are to give a better \nexperience and and basically what we do \nis we operate like a a very partitioned \num index and so basically we are able to \num reach into specific slices of the \ninternet \num you can think of them as like \nvertical slices of the internet instead \nof being very vert or horizontally \num searching and then and then we know a \nlot about the data because we crawled it \nwe've enriched it with a lot of like \nmachine learning systems that we have \ninternally \num and then we can kind of like using \nwhat we know about the data that is from \nthat domain we can create like a much \nmore curated experience for the end user \nand so things like our stack Overflow \napp uh to your point some of our like \nour code generation applications \num are you right application are all \nkind of like very Innovative uh app s \nthat are in the search space yeah that's \nextremely interesting the whole um just \nkind of the high high level idea of like \na symbolic filter might be how we think \nabout it like in specific leviate land \nbut this idea of like I want to search \nthrough stack Overflow I want to search \nthrough Twitter Reddit like you this \ninterface around picking the source of \nyour information and searching and \nhaving that smooth integration \num so I I kind of first became familiar \nwith u.com with um I I first started \nfollowing Richard Sasha's research \naround these kind of systems with the \nco-surge system it was this like \ncovid-19 information retrieval system \nand it had this like brilliant diagram \nthat really outlined it uh can you tell \nus about kind of the \noriginsstoryofyou.com yeah so I think \nthat um \nthe way the way that you hear is that \nthere was there was Richard's had this \nidea for this this kind of like \num this vertically integrated like \nsearch index uh for a while and I think \nthat he was working on it for a bet and \nthen \num with his work at metamind UH being \nacquired by Salesforce becoming uh uh \nentering the c-suite at Salesforce and \nthen kind of like \num doing a lot of like amazing work \nthere on on the Transformer \nTechnologies especially like Ctrl and I \nthink Cove are two of The Shining \nexamples \num meeting Brian McCann who's our CTO I \nthink that they they realized that it \nwas a good time that Google's grip on \nthe search space was kind of \nweakening a little bit because they're \nthey are I think fundamentally their \nattention is marred by what is \ndominantly uh more and more like a \nmarketing company \num and so we thought that it was a good \ntime you know that \num there's there's an opportunity \num there's a lot of people around the \nglobe who are kind of wanting privacy \nmore and more and sort of give people \nthat kind of ability to to have a \nprivate entry point into the internet \num and also giving I think what what we \nfeel are some pretty fresh takes on on \nthe search experience \num it's a lot of responsibility being \nlike the entry point into the internet \nfor a lot of people \num and it felt like that was kind of \nthat responsibility was falls on a few \nselect players and the way that \num \ndata privacy was being handled for being \nsuch a high responsibility \num that it was it was kind of like it's \nit's one of our Central tenets that you \nknow trust facts and kindness are very \nare very Central to to the company and \nso I think taking up the mantle of \ntrying to create a new entry point and \nGateway into the internet \num with with some of those things at the \ncenter of it was I think largely the the \nmotivation for for getting into the \nspace so that was kind of like a uh \nthat's a constellation of ideas of of \nkind of how we got here but it was it's \nkind of a uh globetrotting \nuh tail yeah it's super interesting um \nand I really do want to come back into \nprivacy and the focus on it and that \nlike the particular details of how to \ndeliver it and uh the new technologies \nbut uh I think kind of a conversation \nwe're very curious about uh can you talk \nabout how you came across weeviate and \nthen we can dive into the spark \nconnector yeah sure \nso \num \nwe we \nin building kind of like our own indices \nof the internet we knew that we wanted \nsemantic search capabilities we kind of \nknew that the way that \num transfer learning and NLP was \nadvancing and where had it had gotten to \nwhen we had started the company would \ngive us a pretty unique advantage to \nbuild those capabilities as foundational \nunits \num I think that obviously Google and \nBing have a lot of those capabilities \num but their systems are largely kind of \nbuilt off of lexical search and then a \nlot of the semantic pieces are kind of \nlike retrofit onto their their retrieval \nsystems and so we knew that we wanted to \nhave these things as kind of like first \nclass citizens from the ground up \num that semantic search was going to \nplay a really important role \num and we were kind of like looking \naround for \nwhat semantics are databases we wanted \nto use and I think that very early we \nwere connected with \num the people that we V8 and found that \nkind of the the open source ethos was a \nreally good match for this that it was a \nreally good match for the company's kind \nof like background and being able to \ncontribute to things like this in the \nspace was really important to us \num and so it made a lot of sense to to \nstart to invest in the ecosystem and \nlearn the Technologies I guess a \nseparate question I had before we get \ninto the spark connectors \num in the future do you see yourself \nusing all the different capabilities \ninstead of just uh semantic text search \ndo you also see yourself using semantic \nimage search audio search those sorts of \ncapabilities yeah I think that I think \nthat we're trying to think of \nespecially with where what we're trying \nto do with our you imagine Suite which \nis like a an image generator from \nnatural text something that is very \num very popular as of this year that \ntrying to kind of create like this very \nmulti-modal search experience across \nimages and audio and text is going to be \nimportant and being able to handle \nhaving one system that kind of handles \nvectors \nin like a very Vector first way instead \nof trying to like cluge a bunch of \nsystems together which is I think how \ntraditionally you would have done this \num and I think that \nespecially with what we V8 is doing with \nthe hybrid search \num that I think is going to be a a \nreally big player for a lot of people \neven if they don't even know it yet \num because people who are like operating \nthese search indices right now know that \nyou basically need two different systems \nright like there's no system that does \nlexical search and semantic search \ntogether you have to do that work and \nit's not simple code to write it is it \nis \nhugely complex to kind of figure out how \nto like run those systems in parallel \nand how to how to stitch all of the data \ncoming back together and how to rank it \nall uh very holistically having a system \nthat supports hybrid search \num at its core is is really important \nand so \njust something as far as like \narchitecture Simplicity \num in the search Space is really \nimportant \nespecially from a maintenance \nperspective \nmaybe we can talk a little bit about for \npeople that are new \num what uh can you talk a little bit \nabout what you use spark for at you.com \nyeah we use spark for \nalmost everything \num as far as like our our data ecosystem \ngoes it's all spark native so our are \nkind of like Eventing and logging system \non the back end is all \num streaming Kafka with streaming spark \njobs which we use to kind of \num take all of our real-time uh data \nthat comes out of our system for \nalerting and machine learning use cases \nand then we flattened that out into like \num into a Delta Lake and so we we use we \nlooked at like hoodie and Iceberg but we \nended up going with Delta because it \nfelt like what databricks was doing with \nspark was um \nwas just a little bit more fully \nfeatured at the time \nand so \nthat all integrates really nicely for \nthose who don't know Delta is basically \njust parquet files which is a compressed \ncolumnar format that spark integrates \nreally well with \num and Delta basically adds another \nlayer on top of that which is just this \nbig transaction log that allows for acid \ntransactions on a data Lake which was \npreviously impossible \num and then allows for things like \nversioning and vacuuming and and \noptimization and a lot of the things \nthat you can kind of do in spark etls to \nkind of create \num \nyour your historical data Lake and then \nwe also have a number of like for for \nour analytics for our a b tests for our \num machine learning data sets we have a \nnumber of enrichment jobs that all run \nthrough Spark \nand then even like model training we we \nrun GPU accelerated spark clusters for \nmodel training \num for like data parallelism and model \nparallelism \num and then like I think \npast that \num \nalso our entire like crawling system and \nindexing system and and web parsing \nsystem it's it's all spark so \num a number of of cron jobs that are \num just big scraping jobs that just dump \ndata again to uh parquet \nand then a number of spark connectors \nthat kind of read from the the data Lake \nand then make uh then index all of that \ndata making it kind of like searchable \nfor the end user and so from that \nperspective when you're kind of like \nrunning in a very spark first ecosystem \nyou don't want to have like part of your \nsystem writing \num with kind of like spark connectors \nand then you're running kind of like a \ncluge of like maybe some python code or \nJava code that's also running off of \num running off of the same data but \nrunning in a different environment it's \njust going to double your maintenance \nand double your your monitoring expenses \num as far as like cognitive load and \nhaving to keep track of all that and so \nit made a lot of sense to with our eye \non \num using we V8 for a lot of our our \nsemantic search and possibly hybrid \nsearch use cases that we would need we \nwould need something like this to to \nfully integrate the the weva database \ninto our into our uh data ecosystem so \nwe kind of reached out and we we asked \nif there was anything we could do to \nhelp and uh as they say the rest is \nhistory \nyou you mentioned um I guess this is a \ngood segue into alleviate but what types \nof data sets are you considering using \nuh for Aviator I guess what's the \nroadmap for using wev8 with the with the \nstack that you have right now \nyeah so \num \nI think that \nleviates data model makes a lot of sense \nfor from our perspective \num the way that you can the way that you \ncan \nDefine different schemas and the way \nthat you can create uh the indices and \nand Define your indexes based on uh what \nthe objects are meant that that grafted \nreally nicely onto our already our data \nmodel which was you know this this very \nlike \num vertically aligned search index where \nwe already have these these um a data \nmodel per domain that we're crawling \num some of them are more General than \nothers but for things like \num your data model for a stack Overflow \npage is going to be wildly different \nthan your data model for like a recipes \npage \num some of the things are going to be \nthe same your title your description \nyour url but a lot of the components and \na lot of the what is going to be a part \nof that data model just quickly diverges \nand so that grafts really nicely to how \nuh leviate thinks about schemas and data \nobjects \nand meant that having a mapping which \nwhich we did from a raw HTML page to \nthen a spark data frame and then being \nable to map us that spark data frame \nwhich we already had the code to kind of \nlike get us to that point and be able to \nMarshal that to alleviate data object \nmeant that you could you we could think \nof very easily going from a web page to \nan object in deviate very seamlessly \nusing Apache Spark great well it's it's \nbeen interesting being kind of uh part \nof the channel and hearing a bit more \naround the process and developing a spa \nconnector because I feel it's something \nthat not not many people do um a lot of \nthe times uh you know they're created \none off and it's fairly infrequent \nso would you be able to talk a bit more \nabout how you how you went across \ndeveloping the star connector and what \num what sort of learning resources you \nuse to create one \nyeah obviously \nit it can't comes with um \nall of all the spark connectors are \ndifferent \num because they each require a certain \namount of domain expertise with you know \nbe able to Marshal the data into \nthe end the sync as they call it in \nspark and obviously definitely was it \nwas not a uh one person's effort so I \ndefinitely want to shout out everyone \nfrom weviate who helped out and \nabsolutely \num Sam stalinga who \num was spent a bunch of time with me \npair programming and did a bunch of the \nlift on developing the the spark \nconnector with me \num I think that \nlargely you can you can start out \nbuilding a spark connector by \nfiguring out how to do it in a UDF or a \npandas UDF and then spark a UDF is like \na user-defined function and \nit's just some arbitrary code that you \ntell spark you're going to Loop over \nthis data frame \num we're going to tell you which columns \nfrom the data frame are going to get \npassed in and then you just execute that \ncode per row \nand once you can kind of \nrun your your \nyou have your data integration working \nin a UDF format it becomes a matter of \nyou can do that forever if you want to \nlike at that point you're not going to \nget a ton of like the actual performance \nimprovements because you can parallelize \nthat UDF in a massive way in the same \nway that you could with like a like a \nnative data frame writer but you're \nalways going to be kind of like making \nchanges to that you're always going to \nbe kind of like cutting Against the \nGrain with what are the opinionated like \nspark idiomatic ways of doing things and \nso things like error handling things \nlike checkpointing things like \num retrying a lot of the stuff that you \nwould use spark for \num because you don't want to think about \nthat because it's hard and like you have \nenough things to do on your plate that \nyou don't want to think about like what \nretryologic needs to look like in a data \npipeline or or or \nerror recovery that you kind of delegate \nall of that complexity into Spark so it \nmakes sense at some point once you're \ndealing with a certain level of \ncomplexity to try to graft all of that \ncode into kind of like what what is the \nopinionated spark way of doing things \nand that usually means extending a \nnumber of the the core kind of like \nabstract classes that are available in \nspark so I like I said like the spark \ndata frame writer \num there's a number of examples that you \ncan look at it be it like neo4j or \nelasticsearch \num I think that there's even some \nexamples that you can kind of look at \nbut there's just a number of of core \nclasses that you need to override \num but largely once you have that code \noperating in a UDF it just becomes a \nmatter of grafting that into kind of \num the the objects that that spark kind \nof expects \num and then being figuring out how to \ndeploy that code in a jar format into a \nspark cluster and then and then \naccessing it as a um \nas one of the writers \nbut it it really becomes a matter of \nlike you're either gonna have a UDF and \nyou're gonna run a a map you're going to \nmap that UDF over your data frame versus \nbeing able to say just like take the \ndata frame and I'm going to call it just \ndot write dot format wev8 dot save and \nthen you're you're done \num and so you kind of you take all that \nlogic that you might have to maintain or \nor evolve in \num in a way that is going to be more \ndifficult and then \ntry to once again like delegate all that \ncomplexity into a central place which is \nthe the Wii V8 spark connector \nand then as a community we can all kind \nof swarm on that and make sure that it's \nthe the best in class for writing data \ninto eviate and then lots of people get \nto access it and it becomes very easy to \nkind of turn your brain off which is \nwhich is the point right make it really \neasy to take your spark data frame pump \nit into eviate and not have to think \ntwice about it yeah what what I love uh \nwith the spa connector is it just makes \nit really easy to plug in different data \nsources so uh when we're doing the \nsphere test uh we could just read a \nparquet file and and load quite a lot of \nsignificant amount of data really \nquickly \num you know other data set \num other databases like reading from \nCassandra becomes easy \num so I'm interested to know you talked \na little bit a bit before about the \npipeline we're using streaming in Kafka \nwith their data coming in are you \nplanning to add spark streaming support \nto this connector \nI think it's definitely we have an open \nissue for it \num I think to to all of the people who \nlove open source there's an issue uh you \ncan open a pull request uh if you want \nto go take a look at a really great \nexample there is a um I think a neo4j \ntheir their library is set up so that \num you basically just need to ex it's \nvery similar to \num \nto the batch \num operation it's just like a different \nuh a different API so you're using for \nbatch or using the smart SQL API or the \ntables API if you're in spark 3. for \nstreaming you're you're just you're \nyou're operating on a streaming data \nframe \num and so \nit's a slightly it's it's not gonna be a \nton more work but I think that \num \nI think to answer your question yes \nthere's there's a plan to add it I don't \nknow where we're gonna have time anyone \nout there who wants to take a shot at it \nplease do because because \num I think that being able to make data \naccessible in real time and we V8 would \nbe an awesome feature \ngreat thanks so I guess the other thing \nis Israeli the design Choice when you're \nusing waviate to bring your own vectors \nor to use one of the \num Effect one of the modules \npre-existing to create vectors uh and \nprobably when you're at Large Scale you \nwant to have more controls so you're \nleaning more towards creating your own \nvectors \num do you have any insight around sort \nof how you're approaching creating \nvectorizing \numu.com \nyeah I can I can talk a bit about that \num \nso I think that \nif you are going to \nif you're going to use the vectorization \nmodules internally in vv8 I think that \nis going to take a bit more \nthinking up front with how you're going \nto do your resource planning \nI think that whenever you're talking \nabout writing a ton of data and then you \nare simultaneously using the database on \nthe other side for a user facing feature \nyou're obviously going to have to think \nof read write isolation and then if your \ndatabase is also doing your \nvectorization you almost have three \noperations that you now have to isolate \nbecause \nwriting a ton of data and then trying to \nvectorize that data and then also trying \nto read data and \num for your users now those all have to \nbe isolated because your vectorization \ncan take down your reads your rights can \ntake down your reads your rights can \ntake down your vectorization your \nvectorization can take down your like \nlike all of these things now are kind of \nlike operated in the same \non the same computers and so I think \nthat when you're going to really large \nscale \nunless you have \num if you ever if you have a bunch of \ndevops resources then like \ngo for it sounds like a lot of fun if \nyou don't have a lot of devops resources \num I think that the that error handling \nand the the resource planning in spark \nis probably going to be a bit easier \num I think there's probably a bit more \num going wisdom on how to do that kind \nof resource planning that you'll find on \nthe internet just because I think spark \nis used by more people less people are \nare using Vector databases right now \nthan big data Technologies you'll be \nable to find a bit more on how to do \nthat resource planning it's going to \nmean that \num \nyour you you only have to think about \nthe read write isolation for what is \ngoing to affect your end users if that \nif your vv8 database is hooked up to \num some sort of \nclient application that that people are \nusing which hopefully they are \num \nand for us I think that we were able to \nwe've spent a lot of time thinking about \num \nthe best way to run these Transformer \nmodels ourselves and so we've spent a \nlot of time figuring out like how to \nquantize models how to run graph \noptimizations how to like run like what \nwhat is the most efficient way to run \nOnyx and in a spark \num in the spark environment because that \nstuff isn't actually \num doesn't work out of the box and so if \nyou have that kind of domain expertise \nwhich we do then it makes a lot of sense \nto leverage that and and to figure and \nthen just use what you know about Onyx \nand what you know about model \nquantization and stuff like that \num and get get the most out of that if \nyou don't have a lot of that then then \nthen maybe it does make more sense to \ndelegate that complexity and to leviate \nbecause I know you folks know quite a \nbit about what it means to to run large \nlanguage models as well \num so I think it it really depends on \nthe composition of your team and where \nyour domain expertise lies I know that's \na non-answer and it's really a \nlong-winded way of saying it depends but \nfor us it makes a lot of sense to kind \nof we'll take the complexity of running \nthe models \num because of again what we know about \nOnyx and quantization in the hugging \nphase framework and using like the \nhugging phase Optimum libraries \num and kind of write that code ourselves \nand then we only have to worry about the \nread write isolation for our database \ncan I ask a clarifying question is that \nthe Onyx so it runs on the CPUs and \nthat's kind of what the spark framework \nis built around yeah so \nyou can \nso you can so there are actually \nFrameworks that you can run on GPU so I \nthink cudf which comes out of uh Rapids \nyou can actually run GPU accelerated \nudfs at this point uh it's a bunch of \nwork and uh it's not cheap and if you \nknow how to run \num large language models on CPU with \nOnyx uh which I've done a talk on for a \ncouple different NLP \num talks uh there is a way to do it it \nrequires \num it requires a little bit of finesse \nbut yeah the the short of it is is that \nOnyx is not Onyx infant sessions are not \npickleable and so because of the way \nthat spark works it in pi spark you run \nudfs by pickling your user code and then \nyou broadcast that down to the worker \nnodes and then those worker nodes \nunpickle the code and executed against \nthe data it's the whole like pushing \ncode to data versus pushing data to code \ninversion \num \nbut you can't do that because you can't \npickle Onyx infant sessions and so you \nhave to come and see you have to come up \nwith like a file broadcasting system and \nyou basically have to broadcast the Onyx \nfiles down to the workers and then you \nhave to actually load in those Onyx \ninfant sessions on the Fly \num and then you can get a if once you \nhave that working you can basically \ninfinitely parallelize that because you \njust you just make a copy of the Onyx \nfiles on all of your workers and you \njust load them on the Fly and \num you pay a little bit of i o penalty \nfor reading \nreading from the file from disk to \ncreate the the object in memory the Onyx \ninference session but with enough \nparallelism if you're doing big enough \nbatches that you're pushing through the \nOnyx infant session it ends up becoming \num economical to do that \nand then and then you can get \nin theory unlimited throughput \num we can get like \nthat's how we've we've been able to get \nto like \num embedding like in indexing like \nwhatever billions of documents in \num \nin short order I forget how how fast we \ndid it but it was \nnot a ton of time maybe a few days \nyeah so that that leads nicely to um I \nguess performance questions around using \nSparkle for Eva and caviar learnings \naround what you what you found works \nbest \num so do you have any insights from that \nand maybe I could add some some other \ncomments as well not as many as you do \nso I I would love to hear what you have \nto say I know that I think we actually \nspent some time together uh working on \nsomething similar to this \nbut I know that the \nthe \nhyper parameters around creating your \ngraph for for running hnsw is very \nimportant \num and I think that what I found is that \nrunning the \nrunning the vectorizers ended up being \nwhat what consistently killed my jobs \nand eventually pushed me to \num to to bring my own vectors \nbut this this is something where I am \nstill a student if I'm being brutally \nhonest \nyeah so you see I guess it does the \nlarger scale use cases \num you just have more control if you \nbring your own vectors \num you also need to be careful around \num GPU configuration if you're using one \nof the modules \num as an alternative you can also use \nthe the cloud modules like to open Ai \nand click here \num but around performance just just \nwriting to Eva to \nI obviously it's number of nodes in \nshouting as well so by default default \nVBA will actually configure a class of \nthe number of shads of your cluster size \nso if you have a cluster of size three \nyou'll have them three shots \nand and then when you're writing the \ndata the um in terms of the actual hmsw \nif construction is the most important \nparameter along with Max connections \num where EF construction is basically \nhow far it searches in the graph and \nmatch connections is how many edges each \nvertex has \nso \nso those are definitely \num sort of parameters to optimize and \nthen batch size as well so we do have we \ndo have with the python client we have \nDynamic batching and it's had a few \niterations because it it is um \nit it is quite hard to get right and to \nnot sort of push too much and create the \nbatches too too large and overload with \nyet uh so with spark it's if you've got \na fixed size cluster it's just around \noptimizing the batch size to be \num what you expect and one thing to \nto help with that is really setting up \nPrometheus metrics and just monitoring \nthe the batch latencies \num one thing we have done recently which \nwill be in the next releases optimizing \nbatch latencies and making the \ncompactions with Alice in trees faster \nso there should be some performance \nimprovements there \nit's super similar advice whenever \nanyone asks me how to \nhow to get the most performance out of a \nspark job it's usually like well you \nlook at the metrics and then you turn \nsome knobs and you see what the metrics \ndo and then you keep turning knobs and \nyou do that for a week and then you've \ngot like a great and then it's great \num and there it really isn't like a ton \nof shortcuts to it right \nyeah that's right \num and I guess the other thing is more \nthe ratio of the number of spots Spock \nnodes you need to alleviate \num so generally if you're loading from a \nvery \num from a data Solace that's quite sort \nof basic or quite easy for spark to load \nlike parquet \num often a ratio of one to five or one \nto four is is fine so \num you will need more we the up notes \nand Spark nodes \num generally if you're loading data \nyeah it's never bad practice to \ndecompose and those in those situations \nif you find yourself \nwith a bunch of parsing logic and then a \nbunch of like indexing logic \njust pull those apart you parse you dump \nto parquet and then you have another job \nthat just reads parquet and indexes \nand you get a little bit more \nintrospection because of the way that \nspark \num \nthe uh the the dag execution works it's \nall lazy and and it's it's super unclear \nwhen things actually happen and it can \nlook like some operations take a really \nlong time when they shouldn't because \nreally that that's what actually \ntriggers the eager execution of all the \noperations behind it \num \nyeah yeah and there's uh there's one \ninteresting piece of news is that um all \nthe hugging face data sets are Auto \nconverted to parquet files now \num so that came out I think last week \nand that's yeah that just makes it \neasier to load um all those heavy and \nplace data sets into read the edges \nwhile using the Spy connector so sorry \ncan I ask a dumb question really quick \nso what so parquet Json CSV uh like \nsorry I'm still kind of catching up \nwhat's the difference between parquet \nlike what does it add to it \nparquet is the the the the company line \nis his compressed column in our format \nthat makes all of your dreams come true \num \nI think that it is is basically a way to \nif you're reading Json or Json lines or \nCSV the sheer amount of input data \num requires there's a few different \nthings \nif you want to read all the data in a uh \nand it's Json you have to you have to \nread every line \num \nit doesn't support any filtering right \nbecause you don't know anything about \nthe internal structure of the data \num with parquet when you have certain \nthings like \num spark predicate push down filters \nenabled you can do things like say \nI want to read in only the data where \nthe date is between a week ago and today \nand if you were to read Json \num unless you're you're doing your data \npartitioning yourselves and then you \nlike only read in the subfolders that \nactually have the data if you're if \nyou're partitioning data by date \num you can do all that but parquet will \ndo all that for you \num and basically you can do push down \nfiltering such that you only bring in \nif you're reading Json you would have to \nread that data into memory and then you \nwould perform your your filter \nbut you you end up having to bring all \nthat data into memory to do the filter \nwith parquet you can do things like \num you will only ever bring in memory or \nbring it data into memory that is uh \nmatches your your filtering if you have \nyour your predicate push Downs turned on \num and so that's really nice because \nit's compressed there's just \nfundamentally less data to read and the \nfile sizes are smaller spark is really a \npin like really finicky with having \num lots of of tiny files or too many big \nfiles it likes its files between 250 \nMegs in a gig \num and so kind of like restarting \num data to be of that size is a lot \neasier with parquet \num \nso those are those are a few of the \nreasons so it's you can't read it it's \nit looks like gobbledygook \num to a human but to spark it can do a \nbunch of fundamental out like \noptimizations against its reads and \nrights that makes it easier to get data \ninto spark and get data out of spark \nyeah it's so interesting thanks so much \nfor that I think I've like I'm just kind \nof starting to get in the water of the \nlarge-scale Imports and I've seen this \nproblem where you're trying to Chunk Up \nthe Json but you kind of have to read \nthe whole thing and then parse through \nit but yeah this sounds really \ninteresting and uh yeah let me kind of \nstep out of the way because \nso uh learning so much from this but \nyeah John if you could take it over \nbecause yeah yeah another way to think \nabout it is um what what Spock sort of \nfocused on doing was decoupling the \nHistorical dataway house we had storage \nand compute tied together \nand so \num basically spark is the compute and \nyou are separating the storage onto it's \nno longer a protocol just for that \ndatabase \num to read it's actually sort of an open \nformat but it still has the \num the properties that that make it \nefficient for reading so it's sort of a \nbinary format of column now so you can \ncome just query The Columns you need and \nstuff like that yeah it's a good cause \nthe there's the push down filtering \nwhich means you can get a subset of the \ndata row wise and then like John said if \nyou want to select if you're saying only \nselecting two columns \nit has you can do that by not having to \nread in the entire every single file \nso that makes me think it's is it \nsimilar to hdf5 if you're familiar with \nthat yeah because I've I've used hdf5 uh \npreviously and at the image format \nuh no it's another data set format yeah \nso it is it is similar in some way to \num one differences you can have multiple \ndata sets in one hdf five file but in \nother ways it is quite similar to RK \nit's \num \nyeah it is it is similar but I guess the \nlarge-scale big data use cases more lean \ntowards using parquet or can and sort of \nfile formats like that \nand so one last question I had was just \naround \num so so using spark uh when using spark \nwith a search engine I immediately think \nare using page rank the page rank um \nfeature in spark for generating features \nor potentially generating other sort of \num metrics uh that you're using as kind \nof uh ranking inputs so you're looking \nto store those in webiate as well \nso I'm not sure \nyeah if we were going to like if we're \ngoing to create features based on like \nsome graph formulation of our of our web \ncrawl data \nI'm not \nI'm not sure \nhow \nI'm not sure \nhow I would probably combine combine \nthat with leviate and that could totally \nbe because I'm not an expert in the \ntechnology yet but I'd love to hear \nif I I think for me I'm always looking \nfor Simplicity over anything else I \nthink that like when you're working in \nBig Data like this when you're working \nwith machine learning Technologies like \nthis the simpler you can make it for \nyourself when you're kind of like \ndrowning in all of this very complex \ntechnology like the the worst thing you \ncan do is is to over complicate things \nbecause it's always just gonna be a kiss \nof death for your product and so \nI think if I could yes because I'm \nalways I in my at least in my \ninfrastructure if I can get out of one \ntool what's going to take three \notherwise be it like elastic for lexical \nI don't know like \num using weeviate for semantic and then \nusing like neo4j for graph if there's a \nway to do all of that in weeviate it's \nalways going to be the preferable \nsolution for me so I'd love to hear kind \nof like how you would think through \ncombining graph features or doing like \ngraph based queries in in weeviate and \nhow you would kind of complement that \nwith the semantic capabilities \nyeah so I'm all thinking that um the \nsort of the end result of the graph \ncalculation you would still do the graph \ncalculation in spark but then you can \nrender to ev8 and yeah I see this more \nof an extension of our hybrid search \ncapability so once we \num with the M25 combining with um dense \nretrieval then I think the roadmap there \nis just adding more features around \nre-ranking and different ways of \ncombining different signals together \nlearning to rank and stuff like that \ntrying to like combine features that are \ngoing to learn over time with \nthe the scores that you get from bm25 \nand you know like your cosine \nsimilarities \nyeah that's a cool idea like where you \nhave the um Vector surge score as a \nfeature in the bm25 score as a feature \nand the other symbolic features and then \nyou just use like uh the gradient \nboosting machine I think is a very \npopular machine learning model and \nyeah that's super interesting and I'm \nI'm so interested in this hybrid search \nrank Fusion thing because I think this \nkind of idea of like reciprocal brand \nFusion where you just kind of merge the \nranks in each list is a very powerful \nkind of abstraction for sending the \nqueries to multiple things and I'm also \nkind of I'm sorry if I'm going in too \nmany topics with this but like this idea \nof in like we could have external \ninformation sources as well so maybe we \nconnected to like the Bing API it could \nbe like a part of hybrid search and then \nwe fuse all this information together \nwith your specific leviate data \nyes I'm just I'm curious like your \nexperience with hybrid search and you're \nthinking around it I it's still a pretty \nNew Concept for me kind of just I'm \nstarted with just the bm25 vector search \nbut I'm curious if you have any more \nideas on this kind of idea \nyeah I think it it's always again \nthe cop out is it depends I think that \nlike \nyour use case is always going to Define \nwhere you want to go so like I think \nthat for \npeople who have extremely high Precision \nneeds and they're okay with being low \nrecall \num \ndoing things with \num \nlike your keyword matching and your \nelectrical search is always going to be \nlike the easiest way to to get to a very \nhigh Precision system I think that what \nwe found historically is that using \nsemantic search as a way to start to \nlike beef up your recall so if you have \nlike a pass of lexical search to get \nyour very high Precision items and then \nmaybe you have a second pass of semantic \nsearch that can kind of like enrich that \nwhat you're returning and improve your \nrecall but doesn't really hurt your \nprecision \num I think where it starts to get more \nchallenging is is if when you don't have \nthose as like two separate passes where \nyou have either business logic or \num you don't have \nlike something in between that's that's \nvery human legible \num dictating how you intersperse those \nresults I think that's when \nyou're gonna be best off with some sort \nof like you need some sort of way to \nkind of like Benchmark and and be able \nto like evaluate the system against some \nsort of data set that if you're in the \nsearch space you're probably collecting \neither by human annotators or \num by kind of reverse engineering and \ndata mining from your own like \ninteractions data sets \nfrom the people on the site but even \nthen like \nit's it's always a challenge because \nwith search \num you you are never going to have all \nof your counter factual data right \nbecause like if someone searches and \nthey don't find anything \nor if they did find it and they leave \nlike do you know why people just bounced \nyou know are all clicks a good click if \npeople is like clicking it and then they \nthey like come back to the site and then \nthey click on another thing if I click \non like the top five links like there's \nthere's all these different in the \nsearch space all these different like \ninteraction patterns that don't map \ncleanly to your standard label data set \nyou could like just Benchmark a machine \nlearning algorithm against and then do \nyour hill climbing exercise \num \nand so I think that I think that it make \nlike what worked for us is starting very \nhigh Precision with lexical search \nusing \num using semantic search to improve \nrecall and then when moving to a more \ncomplicated \nmixing algorithm trying to find some \nsort of way to to either \num \nBenchmark against either hand annotated \nor \nfinding finding ways to to data mind \nthat out of your system but like I said \nlike that that step is really tricky in \nthe search space to get clean label data \nI never made the connection to the \ncounterfactual in the relevance judgment \nbefore that's super interesting um maybe \nthis is uh too revealing of a question \nbut can you tell us about how you're \nthinking about collecting data u.com \nyeah so we we've announced this is this \nis public you can go see like um these \nannouncements I don't know I won't get \nin trouble but \num \nbut we've done we do a number of like \nthird-party studies where we get kind of \nlike we do like blind tests of of \nrelevance and we found that \num a lot of the work that we've done \nhave slowly gotten us to a point where \nwe are pretty competitive with Google in \nin certain niches \nand so \nI think we are always trying to \nwe're always trying to ladder up right \nso you have you have your top of the \nladder you've got your third party like \nlike studies that you do \num that are very expensive you have \nhumans doing it you have to pay for it \nlike humans are slow so you don't have a \nton of labeled data coming back for you \nso you have like but it's also the the \nrichest data that you're going to get \nyou get like human insights you get \npeople explaining their thought process \num and then you have kind of like going \ndown a run you have things like you know \nyou have your user metrics like things \nlike \num like retention and people who are \nlike conversion metrics so things that \nare still very high high signal to noise \nbut and our and you get a little bit \nfaster feedback than at the top where \nyou have to do a whole study \num but still very slow feedback and then \nyou kind of like you you start to go \ndown the ladder towards like some of \nyour click signals some of your hover \nsignals \num things like that that you can kind of \nglean from your click stream data and \nyou're usually trying to as you go up \nthat ladder you're trying to find like \nhow strong the correlations are how to \nformulate \num what is a good click versus a bad \nclick and then doing like different \nregression analysis to figure out like \nuh if we if you hover for five seconds \nversus three seconds like is does that \nhave a better like correlation with with \nour retention metrics and then how do \nthose retention metrics then ladder up \nto our like our actual studies that we \ndo and at each step of the ladder you're \ntrying to figure out like how much you \ncan kind of you can glean about what \nbecause what you're trying to do is \nyou're trying to like use the higher the \nfaster feedback signals like clicks and \nthen project into the future what your \nyour studies are going to show like what \ndoes that actually mean for the overall \nrelevance of your search results \num \nit's it's really hard uh we're still \nfiguring it out I think that most people \num now I think if you if you talk to \npeople who work at Google or Microsoft \nthey'll tell you that they still have \nhuman labelers they still they still \nrequire humans to go and label things \nthey just probably have much more \nrefined ways of of laddering up and \nforecasting out what they're they're \nmore fast feedback signals are going to \nmean for those those studies \nyeah that's interesting that that answer \nmakes me think if we're thinking about \nit as a ladder are you training \nindividual models at each rung of the \nladder or is it more of an ensemble \nwhere you have the lower rungs that are \ninforming the models at the at the upper \nend \nit's it's more of the the latter and so \nyou've got a model that's going to tell \nyou you know \nfor different and I think there's lots \nof literature out there that'll tell you \nlike how to \nwhat does it mean to to try to calculate \nuser satisfaction from raw click stream \ndata and you have different formulations \nand then you try and for all of your \ndifferent formulations you try and \nfigure out like what does that mean for \num you're more user you're more \nuser-facing data \nso how do you take click data and \ncorrelate it with user data then how do \nyou take the user data and then \ncorrelate it with \num your your your scores that you're \ngoing to get back from your more \nlong-term studies \nyeah super difficult problem the data is \nprobably very messy \nvery sparse too so awesome that was such \na great coverage of these topics uh Sam \nit was such a master class in these uh \nin these topics especially the \nengineering details the spark the data \ncollection at u.com the widgets the \nsearch interface it's so much learning \nto unpack and I'm so happy we recorded \nthis podcast so thank you so much for \njoining the weba podcast \nyeah thank you so much for having me \nit's a pleasure and looking forward to \nbuilding much of cool stuff with you \nguys in the future \nawesome thank you \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Sam Bean, Zain Hasan, and John Trengrove on You.com and Spark - Weaviate Podcast #32", "path": "", "link":
