{"text": "Building a database from scratch is no small feat. Doing so in Go might just be pure madness. In this talk, Co-Founder & CTO ... \nit's four o'clock so let's time let's \nlook at our preview sorry now next talk \nI have been doing some math things and \ngo but building a database I honestly \nhave strong respect for so next up is \nATM which is going to tell us everything \nabout crazy Journeys and go \nthank you thank you yeah Welcome to our \nmad journey of building a database and \ngo and um yeah it's pretty mad to build \na database at all it may be even worse \nor even a matter to build a database \num Ingo when most are built in \nvery closer \nokay \nokay cool let me start over in case you \ndidn't hear it so hi my name is Etienne \nWelcome to our mad journey of building a \nvector database in go so building a \ndatabase at all could already be pretty \nmad doing it in go when most are built \nin C or C plus plus could be even even \nmatter or even more exciting and we \ndefinitely encountered a couple of \nunique problems that led us to Great uh \nCreative Solutions and there's lots of \nshouts out in there and also a couple of \nwish lists so we just released go 1.20 \nand of course the occasional Madness so \nlet's get one question out of the way \nright away why does the world even need \nyet another database there's so many out \nthere already but \nprobably you've seen this thing called \nchat GPT because that was that was \npretty much everywhere and it's kind of \nhard to hide from it and uh chat CPT is \na large language model and it's it's \nreally good at putting text together \nthat sounds really sophisticated and and \nsounds nice and sometimes is completely \nwrong \num and so in this case we're asking it \nis it math to write a database and go I \nmight disagree with that \num but either way basically we're now in \na situation where on the one hand we \nhave these machine learning models that \ncan do all the cool stuff and do this \nsort of interactively and on the Fly and \non the other side we have traditional \ndatabases and those traditional \ndatabases they have the fact because \nthat's kind of what databases are for \nright so wouldn't it be cool if we could \nsomehow combine those two so for example \non the query side if I ask Wikipedia why \ncan airplanes fly then the kind of \nPassage that I want that has the answer \nin it is titled the physics of flight \nbut that is difficult for a traditional \nsearch engine because if you look at \nkeyword overlap there's almost none in \num but a vector search engine can use \nmachine learning models basically that \ncan tell you these two things are the \nsame and searching through that at scale \nis a big problem \nthen there's that sort of chat GPT uh \nside where you don't just want to search \nthrough it but maybe you also want to \nsay like take those results summarize \nthem and also translate them to German \nso basically not just return exactly \nwhat's in database but do something with \nit and basically generate uh more data \nfrom it and that is exactly where VBA \ncome in so V8 is a vector search engine \nwhich basically helps us solve this this \nkind of searching by meaning instead of \nkeywords without uh sort of losing what \nwe've done in 20 plus years of search \nengine research and now most recently \nyou can also interact with these models \nsuch as chat cpt3 and of course also the \nthe open source versions of it \nso bb-8 is written in go is that a good \nidea is that a bad idea or have we just \ngone playing mad \nso we're not alone that's good so you \nprobably probably recognize these things \nthey're they're all uh bigger brands at \nthe moment than video it is going past \num and some of those vendors have really \ngreat a blog posts where you see some of \nthe like optimization topics and some of \nthe crazy stuff that they have to do so \nif you've contributed to to one of those \nsome of the things I'm going to say \nmight sound familiar \num if not then uh buckle up it's gonna \nget mad so first stop on our mad Journey \nmemory allocations and that also brings \nus to our friend the garbage collector \nso for any high performance go \nApplication sooner or later you're going \nto talk about memory allocations and \ndefinitely consider a database a high \nperformance application that Lisa \nconsider V8 a high performance \napplication and if you think of what \ndatabases do like in essence basically \nyou have something on disk and you want \nto serve it to the user that's like one \nof the the most important user Journeys \nin a database and here this is \nrepresented by just a number so it went \nfor un32 so that's just four bytes on \ndisk and basically you can see these are \nthese four bytes if you parse them into \ngo they would have the value of 16 in \nthat 2 and 32 and this is essentially \nsomething very much simplified that a \ndatabase needs to do and it needs to do \nit over and over again \nso the standard Library gives us the \nencoding slash binary package and there \nwe have this binary.read method with \nwhich I think looks really cool it to me \nit looks like idiomatic go because it \nhas the Iota reader interface like \neveryone's favorite interface and you \ncan put all of that stuff in there and \nuh if you run this code and there's no \nerror then basically you get exactly \nwhat you want you could turn those sort \nof four bytes that were somewhere on \ndisk uh turned them into our in-memory \nrepresentation off that un32 \nso is this a good idea to do that \nexactly like that well if you do it once \nor maybe twice could be a good idea if \nyou do it a billion times this is what \nhappens \nso for those of you who are new to to \nCPU profiles and go this is madness this \nis pretty bad so first of all you see it \nin the center \num parsing those 1 billion numbers took \n26 seconds and 26 seconds is not the \nkind of time that we ever have in a \ndatabase but worse than that if you look \nat that profile we have stuff like \nruntime mluk GC runtime memo runtime M \nadvice so all these things they're \nrelated to memory allocations or to \ngarbage collection what they're not \nrelated to is parsing data which is what \nwe wanted to do right so how much time \nafter 20 seconds did we spend what we \nwanted to do \ndon't know doesn't even show up in the \nprofile \nso and to understand why that is the \ncase we need to quickly talk about the \nstack and the Heap \nso you can think of the stack \nas basically your function stack so you \ncall one function that calls another \nfunction and then at some point \nbasically you go back through the stack \nand this is very short-lived and this is \ncheap and fast to allocate and why is it \ncheap because you know exactly the \nruntime of your variables or the life \ncycle of your variables so you don't \neven need to involve the garbage \ncollector so no garbage collector cheap \nand fast then on the other side you have \nthe Heap and the Heap is basically this \nthis sort of long lift kind of memory \nand that's expensive and slow to \nallocate and why because and also to \ndeal okay why because it involves the \ngarbage collector so if the stack is so \nmuch cheaper then we can just always \nallocate and stack right so warning this \nis not real go please please do not do \nthis um this is sort of a fictional \nexample of allocating a buffer of size 8 \nand then we're going to say like yeah \nplease put this on the stack uh and that \nis not how it works and for most of you \nyou probably say like this is pretty \ngood that it's not that that it works \nthat way because why would you want to \ndeal with that but for me just trying to \nbuild a database and go so yeah \nsometimes like this this something like \nthis may be good or maybe not so how \ndoes it work go does something that's \ncalled Escape analysis so if you compile \nyour code with gcflax Dash M then go \nannotates your code basically and tells \nuser what's happening there so here you \ncan see in the the second line \num that this num variable that we used \nwas moved to the Heap and then in the \nnext point you see the byte stock reader \nwhich represents our io.reader escaped \nto the Heap so two times we see that \nsomething happened to the or went to the \nHeap we don't exactly know what happened \nyet but at least sir there's proof that \nwe have this this kind of allocation \nproblem \nso what can we do well we can simplify a \nbit it turns out that the binary uh or \nencoding binary package also has another \nmethod that looks like this which is \njust called U n32 on the little endian \npackage and the it kind of does the same \nthing you just put in the buffer on the \none side so no reader this time you just \nput in the Raw buffer basically with the \nthe position offset and on the other \nside you get the number of and the crazy \nthing is this one line needs no memory \nallocations so if we do that again our 1 \nbillion numbers that took 26 seconds \nbefore now takes 600 milliseconds so now \nwe're starting to get into a range where \nlike this is acceptable for a day for uh \nfor databases and more importantly what \nwe see on that profile the profile is so \nmuch simpler right now there's basically \njust this one function there \num and that is that is yeah it's what we \nwant it to do so admittedly we're not \ndoing much other than parsing the data \nat the moment but at least we got sort \nof rid of all the noise and you can see \nthe speed up \nokay so quickly to to recap \num if we say a database is nothing but \nreading data and sort of parsing it to \nserve it to the user then uh we do that \nover and over again then we need to uh \ntake care of memory allocations and the \nfix in this case was super simple we \nchanged two lines of code and reduced it \nfrom 26 seconds to 600 milliseconds \nbut why we had to do that wasn't very \nintuitive like that it wasn't very \nobvious in fact I haven't even told you \nyet why this \nbinary.littlend.read why that escaped to \nthe Heap and in this case it's because \nwe passed in the pointer and we passed \nin an interface and that's kind of a \nhint basically that something might \nescape to the Heap so what I would wish \nis yes this is not a topic that you need \nevery day you write go but maybe if you \ndo need this would be cool if there was \nbetter education \nokay so Second Step delayed decoding so \nthis is kind of the idea that we \nwouldn't want to do the same work twice \nand we're sticking with our example of \nserving data from disk but now while the \nnumber example was a bit too too simple \nso let's make it make it uh slightly \nmore complex we have this nested array \nhere basically \num a sort of slice off slice of view in \n64. and that's representative now for a \nmore complex object on on your database \nof course in reality you'd have like \nstring props and that kind of things but \njust sort of to show that there's more \ngoing on than a single number and let's \nsay we have 80 million of them so 10 \nmillion of the outer slice and then \neight elements in each inner slice and \nour task is just to sum those up so \nthese are 80 million numbers and we want \nto know what is the sum of them so that \nis actually kind of a realistic database \ntask for uh for an olap kind of database \num yeah we need to somehow represent \nthat data on disk and we're looking at \ntwo ways to do this uh the first one is \nJson representation and then the second \none would be the sort of binary encoding \nand then then there'll be more \nso Json is basically just here for \ncompleteness sake we can basically rule \nit out immediately so when you're \nbuilding a database you're probably not \nusing Json to to uh store stuff on disk \nunless it's sort of a Json database why \nbecause it's space inefficient so if you \nwant to represent those numbers on disk \nlike space and base Json basically uses \nstrings for it and then you have all \nthese control characters you have like \nyour curly braces and your quotes and \nyour cones and everything that takes up \nspace so in our fictional example that \nwould take up 1.6 gigabyte and you'll \nsee soon that that we can do that more \nefficient but also it's it's slow and \npart of why it's slow is again because \nwe have these memory allocations but \nalso the the whole parsing just takes \ntime so in our example uh this took 14 \nseconds to sum up those 80 million \nnumbers and um yeah as I said before you \njust don't have double digit seconds in \na database \nso we can do something that's a bit \nsmarter which is called length encoding \nso we're encoding this basically as \nbinary and we're spending one uh in in \nthis case one byte so that's basically a \nu and eight and we're using that as a \nlength indicator so basically that tells \nus that when we're reading this from \nthis that just tells us what's coming up \nso in this case it says we have eight \nelements coming up and then we know that \nour elements in this example is U and 32 \nso that's four bytes each so basically \nthe next 32 bytes that we're reading are \ngoing to be our eight inner arrays and \nthen we just continue then we basically \nwe read the next length indicator and \nthis way we can encode the stuff sort of \nin uh yeah in one contiguous thing then \nof course we have to decode it somehow \nand we can do that because we've learned \nfrom our previous example right so we're \nnot going to use \nbinary.littleindian.read but we're doing \nthis in an allocation freeway \num you can see that in the length line \nbasically and um yeah our goal is to \ntake that data and put it into our \nnested sort of go slice of slice of \nslice of U in 64. and \num the code here basically you see we're \nreading the length and then we're \nincreasing our offset so we know where \nto read from and then we're basically \nrepeating this for the the inner slice \nwhich is just hinted at here by the \ndecode inner function \nso what happens when we do this first of \nall the good news 660 megabytes that's \nway less than our 1.6 gigabyte before so \nbasically just by using a more space \nefficient way to represent data uh We've \nyeah done exactly that we've reduced our \nsize also it's much much faster so we \nwere at 14 seconds before and now it's \ndown to 260 milliseconds \nbut this is our mad journey of building \na database so we're not done here yet \nbecause there's some hidden Madness \nand hidden Madness is that we actually \nspend 250 milliseconds decoding while we \nspend 10 milliseconds summing up those \n80 million numbers so again we're kind \nof in that situation where we're doing \nsomething that we never really set out \nto do like we wanted to do something \nelse but we're spending our time on on \num yeah and doing something that we \ndidn't want to do so where does that \ncome from and the first problem is \nbasically that what we did what we set \nout to do was fought from the get-go \nbecause we said we want to decode so \nwe're basically thinking in the same way \nthat we're thinking as we were with \nJason we said that we want to decode \nthis entire thing into this go data \nstructure but that means that you see we \nneed to allocate this massive slice \nagain and that also means that we need \nto in each inner slice we also need to \nallocate again so we're basically \nallocating and allocating over and over \nagain where our task is not to allocate \nour task was to sum up numbers \nso we can actually just simplify this a \nbit and we can basically just not decode \nit like While We're looping over that \ndata anyway instead of storing it in an \narray we can just do with it what we \nplan to do and in this case um this \nwould be summing up the data so \nbasically getting rid of that decoding \nstep \nhelps us to \nmake this way faster so now we're at 46 \nmilliseconds of course our our footprint \nof the data on disk hasn't changed \nbecause it's the same data that we're \nreading we're just reading it in a \nslightly more efficient way \num but yeah we don't have to allocate \nslices and also because we don't have \nthese like nested slices we don't have \nlike slices that basically have pointers \nto other slices so we have better memory \nlocality and now we're at 46 \nmilliseconds and that is that is cool so \n46 milliseconds is basically the time \nframe that can be acceptable for a \ndatabase \nokay so quickly in recap we immediately \nruled out Json because it just wasn't \nspace efficient and we knew that we \nneeded something more space efficient \nand also way faster binary encoding \nalready made it much faster which is \ngreat but if we decode it up front then \nyeah we still lost a lot of time and it \ncan be worth it in these kind of high \nperformance situations if you either \nsort of delay the decoding as late as \npossible until you really need it or \njust don't do it at all or do it in sort \nof small parts where we need it no wish \nlist here but an honorary mentioned so \ngo 1.20 \num they've actually removed it from the \nfrom the release notes because it's so \nexperimental but go 1.20 has support for \nmemory Arenas the idea for memory Arenas \nis basically that you can bypass the \ngarbage collector and sort of manually \nfree that data so if you have something \nthat you know has the same sort of life \ncycle then you can say okay put it in \nthe arena and basically in the end free \nthe entire Arena which would sort of \nbypass the garbage collector so that \ncould also be a solution in this case if \nthat ever makes it like right now it's \nsuper experimental and they basically \ntell you we might just remove it so \ndon't use it \nthird stop is something that when I \nfirst heard it almost sounded like too \ngood to be true so um something called \nsimdi I'll get to what that is in a \nsecond but first question to the \naudience who here remembers this thing \nraise your hands Okay cool so you're \njust as old as I am \num so this is the the Intel Pentium 2 uh \nprocessor and this came out in late 90s \nI think 1997 and was sold for a couple \nof couple of years and back then I did \nnot build databases definitely not in go \nbecause that also didn't exist yet but \nwhat I would do was sort of try to play \n3D video games and I would urge my \nparents to to get one of those new \ncomputers with an Intel Pentium 2 \nprocessor and one of the arguments that \nI could have used in that discussion was \nhey it comes with MMX technology \nand of course I had no idea what that is \nand it probably took me 10 or so more \nmore years to find out what MMX is but \nit's the first in a long list of Cindy \ninstructions I haven't explained what \nCindy is yet but I will in a second \num some of those especially the one in \nthe in the Top Line they're not really \nused anymore these days but the the \nbottom line like avx2 and AVX 512 you \nmay have heard them in in fact for for \nmany open source project they sometimes \njust sort of slap that label and read me \nlike yeah yeah has avx2 optimizations \nand that kind of signals you yeah we \ncare about speed because it's like low \nlevel optimized and aviate does the \nexact same thing by the way \nso to understand how we could make use \nof that um I quickly need to talk about \nVector embeddings because I said before \nthat vva doesn't doesn't search through \ndata by keywords but rather through its \nmeaning and it uses Vector embeddings as \na tool for that so this is basically \njust a long list of numbers in this case \nfloats and then a machine learning model \ncomes in and basically it says do \nsomething with my input and then you get \nthis Vector out and if you do this on \nall the objects then you can compare \nyour vectors so you basically can do a \nvector similarity comparison and that \ntells you if something is close to to \none another or not so for example the \nquery and the object that we have before \nso without any CMD we can use something \ncalled The Dot product the dot product \nis a simple calculation where basically \nyou use you multiply each element of the \nfirst Vector with the same corresponding \nelement of the second vector and then \nyou just sum up all of those elements \nand we can think of this like \nmultiplication and summing as two \ninstructions so if we look out for shout \nout here to the the compiler Explorer \nwhich is super cool tool to see like \nwhat your go code compiles to we can see \nthat this indeed turns into two \ninstructions so this is a bit of a lie \nbecause there's more stuff going on \nbecause it's in the loop Etc but let's \njust pretend that indeed we have these \ntwo instructions to multiply it and to \nto add it \nso how could we possibly optimize this \neven further if we're already at such a \nlow level well we can because this is \nour mad Journey so all we have to do is \nintroduce some Madness and what we're \ndoing now is a a practice that's called \nunrolling so the idea here is that \ninstead of looping over one element at a \ntime we're now looping over eight \nelements at a time but we've got we've \ngained nothing like this is we're still \ndoing the same kind of work like we're \ndoing 16 instructions now in a single \nLoop and we're just doing fewer \niterations so by this point nothing \ngained but why would we do that \nwell here comes the part where I thought \nit was too good to be true what if we \ncould do those 16 operations for the \ncost of just two instructions sounds \ncrazy right well no because Cindy I'm \nfinally revealing what the acronym \nstands for it stands for single \ninstructions multiple data and that is \nexactly what we're doing here so we want \nto do the same thing over and over again \nwhich is multiplication and then \nadditions and this is exactly what these \nCindy instructions uh provide so in this \ncase we can Multiply eight floats with \nother eight floats and then we can add \nthem up \nso all this perfect here maybe not \nbecause there's a catch of course or not \nJourney how do you tell go to use these \navx2 instructions you don't do you ride \nassembly code because go has no way to \ndo that directly the good part is that \nassembly code integrates really nicely \ninto go and um in the in the standard \nLibrary it's used over and over again so \nit's kind of a standard practice and \nthere is tooling here so shout out to \nAvo really cool tool that helps you uh \nbasically you're still writing assembly \nwith uh with Avo but you're writing it \nin go and then it generates the assembly \nso you still need to know what you're \ndoing but it's like it it protects you a \nbit so it definitely helped us a lot \nso Cindy recap um using ABX instructions \nor other CMD instructions you can \nbasically trick your CPU into doing more \nwork for free \nbut you need to sort of also trick go to \nuse assembly and with this tooling such \nas Apple it can be better but it would \nbe even nicer if the language had some \nsort of support for it and you made my \nsaying and now okay this is this mad guy \non stage that wants to build a database \nbut no one else does and needs that but \nwe have this issue here that was open \nrecently and unfortunately also closed \nrecently because no consensus could be \nreached but it comes up back and back \nbasically that go users are saying like \nhey we want something in the language \nsuch as intrinsic so intrinsics are \nbasically the idea of having high level \nlanguage instructions to do these these \nsort of AVX or SMD instructions and C or \nC plus plus has that for example \none way to do that and maybe you're \nwondering like okay if you have such a \nperformance hop path like why don't you \njust write that in C and you see go or \nwrite it in rust or something like that \nsounds good in theory but the problem is \nthat the call Overhead to call C or C \nplus plus is so high that you actually \nhave to Outsource quite a bit of your \ncode for that to to pay off again so if \nyou do that you you basically end up \nwriting more and more and more in that \nlanguage and then you're not writing go \nanymore so personally that's not or it \ncan be in some ways but it's not always \na great idea \nso demo time \num this was gonna be a live demo and \nmaybe it still is because I prepared \nthis running nicely in a Docker \ncontainer and then my Docker Network \njust broke everything and it didn't work \nbut I just rebuilt it without Docker and \nI think it might work if not I have \nscreenshots basically that \num I do a backup so example query here \nI'm a big wine nerd so what I did is I \nput wine reviews into vv8 and I want to \nsearch them now and one way to do it to \nshow you basically that the keyword that \nyou don't need a keyword match but can \nsearch by meaning is for example if I go \nfor an affordable Italian wine let's see \nif the internet connection works \nit does so what we got back \num is basically this this wine review \nthat I wrote about a barolo that I \nrecently drank it and you can see it \ndoesn't say Italy anywhere it doesn't \nsay affordable what it says like without \nbreaking the bank so this is a vector \nsearch that basically happened in the in \nthe background we can take this one step \nfurther \nby uh using the generative side so base \nthis is basically the the chat GPT part \num we can now ask our database based on \nthe review which is what I wrote when is \nthis wine going to be ready to drink so \nlet's see you saw before that was the \nfailed query when the internet didn't \nwork no no it's actually working so \nthat's nice \num and here in this case you can see \nthat so this is using open AI but you \ncan plug in other tools can plug in open \nsource versions of it this is using \nopenai because that's nice to be hosted \nat a service I don't have to run the \nmachine learning model on my laptop then \nyou can see it tells you the wine is not \nready to drink yet we will need at least \nfive more years which is sort of a good \nsummary of this and then you can see \nanother one is ready to drink right now \nit's in the perfect drinking window so \nfor the final demo let's combine those \ntwo let's do a semantic search to \nidentify something and then do an AI \ngeneration basically so in this case \nwe're saying find me an aged classic \nRiesling best best wine in the world \nracing \num and based on the review would you \nconsider this wine to be a fruit bomb so \nlet's have sort of an opinion from the \nmachine learning model in it and here we \ngot one of my favorite wines and the the \nmodel says no I would not consider this \na fruit bomb while it does have some \nfruity notes it is balanced by the \nminerality and acidity which keeps it \nfrom being overly sweet or fruity which \nis um if you read the text like this is \nnowhere in there so this is kind of cool \nthat the that the model was was able to \ndo this \nokay so let's go back now with the demo \ntime by the way have a GitHub repo with \nlike this example so you can run it to \nyourself and um and yeah try it out \nyourself so this was our mad journey and \nare we mad at go are we mad to do this \nwell I would pretty much say no because \nyes there were a couple of Parts where \nwe had to give get really creative and \nhave to do some some yeah rather unique \nstuff but that was also basically like \nthe Highlight Reel of building a \ndatabase and all the other parts like it \ndidn't even show the parts that went \ngreat like concurrency handling and the \nthe powerful standard library and of \ncourse all of you basically representing \nthe Gopher Community which is super \nhelpful and uh yeah this was my way to \nbasically give back to all of you so if \nyou ever want to build a database or run \ninto other kind of high performance \nproblems then maybe some of those \nexamples helped you and if you now want \nto try out bb8 you can see it on bb8io \nor the GitHub is vb8 vv8 you can follow \nme on Twitter at \nEtienne di or you can follow viviated \nvv8io I don't have a mastodon yet \nbecause that kind of seems to be the new \nthing but I was busy writing assembly \ncode so I had no time to create one yet \num yeah that is our mad Journey thank \nyou very much \n[Applause] \ncool if you have yeah I see a question \nI'll try to run towards you \nI've been running all day so it might be \nslow \nhi um thank you for for your talk \num quick question about a compression uh \nyou talk a lot about data size \num have you waited the pros and cons \nbetween the compression to reduce the \nsize and so the the bandwidth needed to \nread the data and then the penalty of \ndecompressing yes yes absolutely so \nbasically the the uncompressed example \nwas sort of the simplified version \nbecause 25 minute talk and had to cut \ndown in real life definitely compression \nespecially like using a un 64 in this \nexample most of the bits are probably \ngoing to be zero so you can gain a lot \nfrom from a compression and we have an \ninverted index also in in vv8 so we have \nthese like kind of posting lists and \nthey're very similar because they they \nstart from from zero basically go up so \nthere's lots of overlap and lots of \ngains to be made with compression \num yeah maybe something for for our mad \nJourney part two \nyeah so my first question is uh doesn't \ngo itself leverage this simd things it \nseems like it should compiler should do \nthese things \nsort of okay-ish the problem is \nbasically \num typically with like the AVX 512 where \nwe wanted to do eight things at once \nthis is specific to some CPUs and the go \ncompiler doesn't doesn't do it as well \ntypically from the way that the go \ncompiler does it I could get like a two \ntimes speed up but never more sort of \nnever in the uh yeah so Realms of eight \ntimes but in general and this is not so \nmuch a go specific thing like hand \noptimized uh um yeah assembly or low \nlevel Sim D is most likely going to be \nfaster than what a compiler do simply \nfor the fact that you know exactly what \nyou want to do like how long the video \nthey're going to be in this kind of \nstuff whereas the compiler basically has \nto guess \nand the second question is like did you \ntry any other encoding like uh something \nlike uh there was something called group \nparent I'm not sure we are using floats \nhere but
