{"text": "Thank you so much for watching the 28th Weaviate Podcast! This episode features Maarten Grootendorst, developer of the ... \nthank you \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nchecking out another episode of the \nwevia podcast I'm super excited to \nwelcome Martin gruchendorf to the \npodcast uh Martin has created this \nincredible uh Library educational \ncontent around Bert topic so this idea \nof topic modeling using an analysis in \nVector space to extract high-level \ntopics to understand what is in these \nVector clusters and what makes them \ndistinct from each other so firstly \nMartin thank you so much for joining the \npodcast oh thank you thank you for \nhaving me here I'm really looking \nforward to this \nawesome man so could we dive into the I \nthink it's about four steps to producing \nthe bird topic analysis could we kind of \nwalk through the algorithm yeah yeah of \ncourse uh uh so generally four steps uh \ndepending on your view a little bit more \nand extend it to 10 or so but let's keep \nit straight forward \num so so what often is happening is if \nyou get a bunch of documents right there \nare maybe a few thousand hundreds of \nthousands millions of them especially in \nthe context of we V8 for example there \ncan be many more \num we embed those we need to have some \nsort of numerical representation \nand I'll go into that a little bit later \nbut it really doesn't matter necessarily \nwhich type of embedding technique you \nuse that kind of depends on the use case \nso when we have that numerical \nrepresentation it's typically in high \ndimensional space right and uh that's \ngenerally fine because it gives a lot of \ninformation about the document but doing \nsomething in high dimensional space can \nbe tricky \nso before we go to the clustering step \nwhich talk about a little bit later we \nfirst reduce the dimensionality of these \nn dimensional factors \nthat typically works works out well it \nit can be a time consuming step so \nthat's still something we need to take \ninto account \num but it makes sure that some of the \nthe global information is you know is \nbeing kept in low dimensional space \nwhere we don't have the curse of \ndimensionality where we can use even \neuclidean distance measures with which \nobviously we cannot use in high \ndimensional space so so we can do \nsomething with that \num after that we're doing the clustering \nthe dimensionality reduction of course \nis done with umap which is now currently \nyou know mostly state of the art there \nand the clustering is being done with \nhdb scan it has the nice property of of \ngenerating outliers \nbut that depends on the use case because \nnot necessarily everyone agrees that \nit's a nice feature to have right \num so so then you have clustering so I \nhave these three initial steps we have \nclustered our documents into \nsemantically uh uh into topics with \nsemantically similar documents and \nthat's nice and all but then we need to \ndo some extraction of these topics to \nget some representation out of that \nand there are quite a number of \ntechniques that you can use for that but \nfrom the context of per Topic at the \nvery least \num we wanted to have something \nthat doesn't necessarily make a lot of \nassumption on what happens before that \nnow if you take hdb scan for example \nit's in the name it's a density-based \nalgorithm so these clusters decant they \ncan be circles they can be lines they \ncan be squares or anything you can \nimagine \num and because they are so different in \nstructure we wanted to have a topic \nextraction method that doesn't make any \nassumptions on how those how those \nclusters might look like or might not \nlook like \nwith the ID of later introducing \nmodularity but again that's something \nfor later so then we resort to \nsomething that has been done quite for \nfor quite some time and it's just a \ngeneric bag of words approach with the \nsmall Twist of not considering documents \nbut considering uh topics instead \nclusters so to say and same thing \napplies with the the CTF IDF that's done \nto score these words again we're not \nlooking at individual documents because \nwe don't necessarily care about those \nbut we're more interested in their \nabstract Global representation so also \nthere we focus on clusters instead of \ndocuments and yet those four steps are \nessentially how birdtopic works \nyeah and I'm sorry to distill it into \njust four I think this is kind of how \nwe've been starting to wrap the \nfoundation of we being where we have you \nknow embed the embed the data into \nvectors using say a sentence Transformer \nthen uh compressed into mentality with \numap or tsne hdb scan clustering and \nthen concatenate the Clusters into \ncluster documents and then extract and \nthen you say TF IDF to get the keywords \nI just kind of been my Foundation \nguiding thing uh I attended to talk at \ncohere where you presented this really \ninteresting diagram of kind of the \nbuilding blocks of this and you touched \non this density based clustering \ncompared to k-means you might quickly \njust touching on that a little more say \nthe difference between uh you know what \nafter you do you know vectors then umap \nand then say hdb scan versus k-means how \nthey have different structures you \nmentioned say you know circles in your \ndata could you explain that a little \nmore the difference between those two \nclustering algorithms yeah sure so \num \nan assumption of hdb scan or not \nnecessarily an assumption it takes into \naccount that certain clusters can have \ndifferent forms and shapes and sizes and \num you know it works rather well when \nyou have a piece of data that starts \nhere and goes all the way up to a \ncertain other point and it follows that \ndensity along the line and using that it \ncan essentially make sure okay we still \nhave that cluster because it's difficult \nto capture those clusters that aren't \nnecessarily in in one side small dense \nstructure \nokay means does something entirely \ndifferent and basically draws lines over \nall of these uh clusters and assumes \nthat everything within you know let's \nsay square or certain form that the very \ncentroid of that is the most \nrepresentative of that cluster and hdb \nscan \ndoesn't necessarily have that assumption \nso when you for example extract the \ncentroid from a cluster found by hdb \nscan it doesn't necessarily have to be \nthe most representative one because you \nknow if you have a circle so all all \npoints around the circle and there's one \nsingle point in the middle \nand see this game most likely will find \nall of those \nmaybe not the the middle one but if you \ntake the the centroid of that it's not \nreally representative of everything that \nhappens on the outside right so then a \ncentroid based method for topic \nextraction doesn't \nwork it might work if you use gay means \nbecause that assumption is more built \ninto the algorithm \nbut we don't care about you know all of \nthe assumptions that all of these \nclustering algorithms have there's way \ntoo much taken to account so so we \nseparate them \nyeah that's a super interesting Insight \nthe uh you know say the circle shape \nwith the dot in the middle and this sort \nof describes this idea of Representative \ndocuments so what might be the problem \nwith that where where you also love the \nexample of the line and if you have K \nmeans it's going to try to like cut that \nup into four parts of the line with the \ncentroids \nyeah wow so the the density thing is \nincredibly interesting uh can we maybe \ntouch on the final product the keyword \nlisten and come back to the hierarchical \nthe topic trees but um so so as we you \nknow concatenate each cluster into a \nlong cluster document and then we use \ntfid you have to find the unique \nkeywords I've seen ideas like setting \nthe topic labels where you go through \nthe list then you find the label through \nit can you talk about sort of what you \nget by doing that when you when you go \nthrough a list of keywords like say \nmedicine Healthcare and you say okay let \nme call this the medicine cluster uh \nSports basketball baseball the sports \ncluster I can talk about that kind of \nidea of setting the topic label and how \nthat helps search through the keyword \nlists yeah of course so so the thing \nwith topic modeling is that's a rather \nsubjective technique right it's uh first \nof all it's unsupervised so it's really \nhard to have a ground truth and \nobjective evaluation metrics and the \nsecond thing is what you consider to be \na topic I don't necessarily really agree \nwith \nnow the the entire idea of having all of \nthese words in in a topic description \nhelps you understand oh this is what the \ntopic really is about it already already \nprovides you with some context about \nyou know what you can find in that topic \nbecause if you would give it a single \ntopic label like like sports \nI still don't know what we're exactly \ntalking about in that topic so there's a \nlot of human evaluation \num a human in the loop is still very \nnecessary in these kind of techniques \nbecause I can give you some sort of \ndescription but you still have to \ninterpret it yourself and understand \nwhat the topic is about \num and I think that's very important \nwith these kind of techniques because \npeople tend to look for evaluation \nmetrics and then do some grid search on \nthat and find the so-called best method \nthat that really doesn't work in topic \nmodeling you can try if you have a very \nspecific use case with a very well \ndefined evaluation metrics \nbut even then it's it's so subjective \nthat the person really is necessary to \ndo something with these words and these \nlabels and you know ideally create them \ntheirselves \nyeah is that human in the loop I've seen \nideas like use like a gbt3 to try to \nguess do you like that idea yeah yeah \nI've heard that one before of course I \nmean it makes sense it's it's text \ngeneration so if you provide it with \neither some of these words or perhaps \nsome of of the representative documents \nwhatever those might might be then you \ncan get some sort of description \nfrom there the difficulty here in lies \num you know gpg isn't always necessarily \nthat accurate in creating topic \nrepresentations it's not specifically \ntrained for that \num from an API and and open source \ndevelopment perspective you would need a \nvery large gpt3 model in various \nlanguages on top of that which you know \nmakes it not really that easy to use out \nof the box so hopefully I can provide a \nbasic pipeline where you can tweak and \nchange whatever it is you want and if \nyou feel like you need gpt3 to do some \nfine tuning \ngo at \nyeah it's really I think maybe the idea \nis like with the few shot learning we \ncould give it a few examples and and \nmaybe that would work um but really I I \nfind this idea of labeling the Clusters \nso interesting with with say uh with say \nthe way that we search through Wikipedia \narticles we vectorize each of the \nparagraphs and then we still have the \ntitle of the article as like a symbolic \nfilter so you could ask say uh what year \ndid Barack Obama become president and \nyou can filter that by having article \nBarack Obama is the title and then that \nhelps reduce the search space a lot so \ndo you see maybe labeling these clusters \nwith uh with the summarization of the \nkeyword lists I guess as being a way to \nsimilarly kind of say just search \nthrough this cluster and unsupervised \nyeah you could definitely the the one \nthing to note here is is that you had \nneed to have some ID beforehand what \nyou're looking for uh with topic \nmodeling that isn't necessarily always \nthe case you know you have uh \ntickets for some software hundred \nthousands of tickets and you just want \nto see what's in there without any \nguidance okay then it's completely \nunsupervised \num with few shot learning of course you \ncan say okay I have some ID I don't \nnecessarily know the entire thing \nbecause otherwise it's a classification \ntask but with few short learning you can \nthen say okay I have some ID let's see \nif we can do some semi supervised view \nshot learning on top of that \nbut then again you have to define those \nlabels very well beforehand because if \nyou don't uh again then it becomes \ndifficult \nI've always been I haven't quite wrapped \nmy head around how semi-supervised \nLearning Works in this sense do you mind \nexplaining that a little more and I \nthink that would be a great topic to go \ninto \nso there there are roughly two ways to \ndo semi-supervised uh topic modeling and \nthe thing is with your topic I'm trying \nto keep it as simple as possible without \nany without making way too complex for \nthe user the first one is a dependency \non umap new map in itself does some \nsemi-supervised dimensionality reduction \nand by leveraging that uh you know \nhdb scan finds those uh those things \nrather well the other thing you can do \nis essentially saying okay I have a \ntopic that I know is in there it's about \nsports or whatever and then you create \nsome keywords or sentence yourself and \nyou embed that one and then it's simply \na cosine similarity with all of these \ndocuments and searching for the ones \nthat are you know that are above a \ncertain threshold and simply say okay I \nknow these labels uh those are these in \nthese topics \num and then you average them out \nby nudging it a little bit more to the \ntopic that you have to find yourself and \nby averaging out those uh documents \ntowards that specific topic most likely \nsomething like hdb scan will capture it \nso sorry for misunderstood so you try to \nembed a single word so say \num you know I I'm searching through my \ntweets and I want to have like deep \nlearning let's say a single phrase so I \nembed that into the same Vector spaces \nthe sentence Transformer is going to \nvectorize the tweets and then I use the \nnearest neighbors of that to say this is \na topic and then hdb scan like it can \ntake that signal to kind of structure \nthe whole Space around it sort of yeah \nso what you're essentially doing is \num \nyou embed them in the same space and \nwhen you find documents using some sort \nof nearest neighbor approach that are \nvery similar to deep learning you \naverage the embeddings between that \ndocument and the Deep learning and \nbetting and every effort to them and use \nthat instead of the original you know \ndocument embedding then you nudge it \nslightly towards the Deep learning \num \ninput and if you do that with a certain \namount of documents hdbs can of course \nwill pick that up because you kind of \nhave notched it towards the same \nembedding \nhmm \nyeah I think that's incredibly \ninteresting and it kind of is inspiring \nmy interest further in this idea of say \nkind of recursive partitioning like \nwhere first we have all of our data \ncluster cluster and then we want to go \nwith it so say it's all of Wikipedia and \nwe have like sports history medicine and \nthen we want to take the medicine \ncluster and then do it do it again and \nnow it's like different kinds of \nmedicine how do you think about that \nkind of recursive verb topic like keep \ngoing into the Clusters when it's really \nbig data so so so that's something that \nyou can actually naturally do with of \ncourse hdb scan but because within their \ntopic we're not trying to be too \ndependent on a specific clustering model \nit's a post-hoc analysis so what you can \ndo is you can say I have 100 000 \ndocuments I want eventually some \nfine-grained hierarchy in that so what \nwe do is we say with okay means for \nexample we're going to generate a \nthousand or or five thousand small \ntopics \nand after we have created those 5000 \ntopics we we simply do some sort of \nhierarchical analysis on top of that the \nthe exact one that you want to do that \nthat's up to you of course \num and build those 5 000 topics up until \nyou get you know less and less and less \nand less and then you can slice them at \ndifferent levels uh and from there \nextract the hierarchy that's in there \nand zoom in whenever necessary so \ninstead of going from one topic to very \nsmall ones we're going from very small \nones to a single topic \nuh so so when you you're concatenating \neach cluster to make the cluster \ndocument that is where how you run the \ntfidf algorithm to get the keywords so \nwith the hierarchy is each small slice \nthe inverse document frequency is \ncompared against all the data we started \nout with or sort of like its neighbors \nin the tree on the same level so to say \nso so essentially what we're doing is we \nhave with the CTF IDF from those 5000 \ntopics we just have a a topic to our \nMatrix with some scores and within that \ntopic term Matrix we're essentially \ncomparing which ones are most similar to \none another and we iterately iteratively \nmerge them and at each step of merging \nwe get another layer and get another \nlayer again another layer \num and because we've already done the \nclustering whenever you combine two \ntopics uh together the only thing you \nhave to do is recalculate the CTF IDF \nrepresentation you don't have to do \nanything with the clustering whatsoever \nbecause the CTF IDF is based on the \ndocuments not necessarily on the \nClusters that's just split \nand if we know which Blitz to combine we \njust recalculate the CTF IDF \nrepresentation and you have your new \nhigher abstract cluster \ncould we step one so the way the topics \nare merged do you mind sorry I'm not cut \nthe way that it's merged just one more \ntime yeah \nyeah of course so so what we're \nessentially doing is you have for each \ntopic you have a vector right uh in this \ncase it's a sparse Matrix uh for for the \nentire topic term Matrix \num but for each topic you have some \nvalues \nand we have 5 000 topics \nsome are bound to be similar to one \nanother especially if you use just \ncosine similarity between two topics you \nget certain topics are very similar so \nif you do simple linkage \nsome hierarchical linkage what you \nbasically can say is okay I'm gonna \nsearch for the two topics that are most \nsimilar to each other \nand these two topics I'm going to find \nthe documents for all of for for both of \nthem and I'm going to combine them \ntogether into one new long document and \nthen recalculate the CTF IDF \nrepresentation \nand if we do that plenty of times uh \nthen we suddenly get a little bit less \nuh less topics and uh more abstract and \nmore General representation \nsuper interesting and and yeah that way \nof the unsupervised kind of \nsub-population Discovery is so \ninteresting uh can we talk also about \ngeneralizing this to image embeddings or \nsay we have a vector that describes the \nimage but then we also maybe have some \ntext for each of the image too like \ncaptions or maybe it's linked to an \narticle uh can you describe how we could \nuse this algorithm to explore other \nkinds of vector spaces like yeah like \nimage vectors Maybe audio vectors would \nhave an Associated text \nyeah so so what were topics essentially \ndoing is saying okay look I'm gonna make \nthe clustering step in some way \nindependent from the topic extraction \nstep \nand what that means is that we normally \nsay okay I'm gonna convert my documents \ninto some sort of numerical \nrepresentation through language models \nbut what if we have other metadata that \nwe can cluster instead well we can \nsimply throw those in instead of you \nknow the document embeddings and cluster \nwhatever else is interesting and whether \nthat's metadata or images for example \ndoesn't really matter again we don't \ncare how we do the embedding extraction \nstep we just want data to Cluster and \nwhether that's the document embeddings \nor images \nthat doesn't matter and then when we \nhave clustered all of these \ndata whether that's images or text or \nstreaming data or what have you then we \ntake the documents for each of those \nclusters and do the topic extraction \nstep so so what you essentially can do \nis you can say beforehand that you want \nyou know \nimages \nto be clustered and those can be from uh \nyou know booking.com or Amazon or \nwhatever you know what have you and you \ncluster dose instead of the the document \ndescriptions and the great thing about \nthat is is that \nyou know an image typically represents \none sort of concept one sort of topic \nand with very long documents that's not \nnecessarily the case then we get a lot \nof different topics and we have to split \nthem into sentences and if you do the \nimages you know you get one thing and \nthen you can use the documents and see \nwhich parts of that document mostly \nrepresents that image \nyeah I think that idea is super powerful \nthe decoupling of clustering and topic \nextraction slash kind of metadata \nanalysis like if we have patients we \ncould uh put say their uh you know like \nimages like medical images would be a \ngood one to vectorize or I don't know \nmaybe we have like clinical notes so we \ncan vectorize and then we'd also have \nthe metadata like age weight height \npre-existing conditions and so with also \nthis cluster analysis we can you know \nhave these sort of like histograms uh \nyeah all the violin all the kind of \nthings for each of the metadata each of \nthe Clusters as well do you think about \nthat kind of thing also like symbolic \ndata visualization achieved through the \nclusters of metadata on them oh that's \ninteresting especially the the example \nyou mentioned with with clinical data so \nif you have a number of patients uh and \nyou cluster dose instead of \num the text related to those pages you \ncan say okay we have found certain \nsubgroups of patients and within those \npatients they typically talk about \ndecent decent these topics \nand that might make it you know even \nmore interesting to do things like that \nit's more Advanced Techniques so to say \nso I haven't actually seen it being used \nlike that \nbut yeah I mean when you do a fit \ntransform you provide documents and some \nsort of data typically embeddings but \nthrow in your metadata I'm very curious \nto see how something like that would \nlook like \nyeah I sort of brought this up \naccidentally but one of the questions I \nhave written down to ask you about and I \nthink we'll come back to the technical \nquestions after this is uh so you're \nalso a psychologist \ndo you use this in your work how have \nyou found like has this kind of been \ninspired by that uh of \nto certain extent \nso there's a lot of psychology that \nindeed tensed up back tends to to get \nback into the package itself and it \nreally comes from making sure that it's \nto use that you communicate things \nproperly \num API development things like that \nwithout necessarily looking at what is \nstate of the art or what is best it's \nreally practical approach so to say \nand it really stems from my own needs \nwhen constantly needing to install \ndifferent types of topic modeling \ntechniques for different use cases which \nit can be difficult at some point \nbecause if you install if you pip \ninstall a it has a different feature set \nthen you pip install B \nespecially when you compare for example \na hierarchical topic modeling with \nDynamic topic modeling they typically \nend up with two entirely different topic \nshots and then I cannot combine them or \ncompare them or you know \nand that makes it difficult and \num \nI then start to focus okay what do users \ntypically want to be using for for these \nkind of things what makes it easy what \nmakes it simple what makes it fun maybe \num \nso at some point I figured okay when we \ncreate a topic model I want to have \nincluded Dynamic topic modeling \nhierarchical topic modeling \nsemi-supervised topic modeling uh online \ntopic modeling if it's possible uh just \nmake it if possible a One-Stop shop for \ntopic modeling \nso that you can create a baseline with \neverything you you do and then if you \nwant there are more specialized topic \nmodeling techniques that you maybe can \nuse for very specific instances that's \nfine but this should provide you with \nwith most things needed inside of a \ntopic model \num \nso so yeah I've mostly focused on things \nfrom a user perspective what do users \nneed uh what do they want if I hear \nabout a feature in in the issues page \ntypically I write it somewhere down and \nsee if I can create it \num \nso yeah it typically it often tends to \nget back to the psychological background \ninto development and Communications and \ndocumentations and things like that \nso is it like with the perspective of \nlooking through psychological literature \nuh and trying to break it up to keep up \nwith it because I know like with trying \nto keep up with machine learning \nliterature it's pretty exhausting so I \nwould love something like this to \nyeah no that would be perfect but \nunfortunately I haven't found a way to \ndo exactly that because I've I agree \nfully with you that it's exhausting to \nkeep up with literature I mean even in a \nvery specific soft field like topic \nmodeling it's it's oh it's so difficult \nto keep up and we're of course in a very \nlarge natural language processing domain \nwhich gets even larger when you consider \nmachine learning and the transition from \nTransformers into computer fission all \nthese other types of fields \nuh no I mostly focused and that's my my \npragmatic approach on things that I can \nuse right now \nso state-of-the-art is awesome state of \nthe art is great and at some point uh \nyou know it's necessary because that's \nthose are the things that we're going to \nend up and using but I really like to \nfocus on \nthe things that I can use in practice \nthe things that are performant \num that simply work \nbut to get back to your original \nquestion I've mostly used topic modeling \nnot in psychological domain but now \nmostly in uh in clinical research \nyeah super interesting and I I want to \ncome back to you mentioned Dynamic and \nonline topic modeling which are two \ntopics I know you understand that I'd \nlike to ask you about but uh kind of on \nthis topic of applications also I I \nthink this kind of sub population \nidentification could be super useful for \nthe general thing of generalization \ntesting with deep learning where we want \nto know like what is in distribution \nwhat is out of distribution and uh say \nwe you know put our data through hdb \nscan and then we only train on data that \nisn't defined as an outlier and then \ntested on these outlier points or \ndifferent kinds of ideas like that where \nyou things like say you train in one \nhospital's medical images then you test \non a new hospital and the Machine \nlearning model fails \nyou think about that kind of \ngeneralization testing as a application \nfor this \na bit uh generally topic modeling \nis approached as in a very explorative \nuh way of getting to understand your \ndocuments \num it really helps that you understand \nokay this is my data these are potential \nclusters we can of course use hdb scan \nto get more to the very core of these \ntopics but it often throws out a lot of \ndocuments \nthat yeah could be or most likely are in \num in the cluster so it's rather strict \nfrom uh from the default settings which \nis fine because it really depends on on \nyour approach but there are more and \nmore packages that I've seen developed \nthat focus on on the explorative \napproach of essentially bird topic so \ncreating a 2d representation \nand do the do labeling yourself and see \nif some things make sense \num so that's that's what we're topic for \nexample also gives back to you there are \nvisualizations where you can have a 2d \nrepresentation of the documents and the \nrelated topics uh and there are some \nother packages that go beyond even that \nwhere they say okay now that we have \nthose potential topics let's see if they \nmake sense let's label them ourselves \num so that that human labeling becomes \nmore and more important \nyeah that's extremely interesting I I \nthink also I hope this isn't too \ntangential but like this exploratory \ndata analysis I think it's really useful \nfor like data cleaning deduplication \nwhen I first saw vert topic I put the \nchord 19 data set into it and then I saw \nI was like oh I didn't even realize \nthere were languages other than English \nin this data set until I did this \nbecause I didn't really like look \nthrough it because like when web scrape \ndata or are you talking about like going \nto PubMed and getting 300 000 papers for \nyour data set it's like you don't really \nknow what's in it and so yeah exactly \nand and I think that's that's also \nsomething that has gained popularity \nover the last few years right the \nquality of the labels that you have and \nwhat what is it exactly in all of those \nstandard data sets that everybody has \nbeen using and nobody knows really if \nthere's something in it that shouldn't \nbe in there I think even the 20 News \nGroup State the set has some has some \nDutch articles or some Dutch language \nsomewhere in there that I found recently \nyou know know these kind of things are \nimportant because we're using them \nconstantly in research and we don't \nalways know exactly what's in there \nso to give to use such a method whether \nit's per topic or something else to have \nan idea okay but we're missing this \ninformation or these labels \npotentially shouldn't be in this cluster \nbut or in this class what should be in a \nseparate cluster or are they connected \nto one another \nthat kind of information is is way more \nimportant than I think people realize \nmm-hmm yeah and with like this \nself-supervised language modeling where \nyeah you have unlabeled data but the \nquality of it yeah it's not like the UN \nlike the quality of your labels in the \nsame sense of like an ner model where \nyou're like labeling each thing but you \nstill want to have good data for the \nlanguage model \nyeah yeah exactly and uh \nspending time on labeling a little bit \nmore than you do on fine-tuning your \nmodel I think that you will get the main \nadvantage of going through your data \nunderstanding what it means uh \nthose labels are exceedingly important \nbecause they are often in other \nsubjective still in a way because you \nlook through a document and you give the \nlabel no I I mean that's that's my \ninterpretation you know and another \nlabeler might disagree \nso spending time on these kind of things \nis just important \nyeah that's do you see that a lot of \ndisagreement within label it like you \nhave a list of keywords right and then \nto to psychologists would disagree with \nwhat the list of keywords that what it \nwould conclude to so \nyeah so so it's not necessarily that I \nsee psychologists a lot with topic \nmodeling uh I see that more in policy \nand politics but what you definitely see \nin Psychology quite a lot is uh \nnow if you have observers that observe \ncertain Behavior if you're a certain \ndata or certain things that that humans \ndo that that need human interpretation \nyeah that then we need several people \nmaking that judgment to see if there's \nan overlap and if two or three don't \nagree over the same instance \nsomething is going on \nat the very least we can say it's not a \nvery clear label or something that isn't \nuh clearly defined or cannot even be \nclearly labeled and as such we can say \nokay it's an outlier or it's not \nsomething that represents the thing that \nwe have in mind \num and that's also something that indeed \nyou see more and more \npopping up in Industry so so Prodigy is \ndoing amazing things with the with the \nlabeling tools \num and I think that's where it needs to \nstart looking through your data seeing \nwhat's what's happening there \nideally if you have the time have two \npeople look at the same date and see if \nthey come to the same conclusions if \nthey understand the use case well and \nunderstand what the label should \nrepresent well because you know if we \ntalk about certain labels I might have \nhave a certain Concept in mind because \nof my history and experience with that \nconcept but your experience with that \nconcept might be different so you know \nyou have your own subjective experience \ninvolved in in labeling \nand in a way we might need to throw that \nout or you know average them across \nlabelers people who look at the data \num a jacket \nyeah I think the idea of across human \nlabelers and then there's also this \ninteresting idea of having multiple \nmodels embedding spaces so this topic of \nlike domain adaptation like if I embed \nmy core 19 data set with the all mini LM \nL6 train on all sorts of data like \ncompare like the general model compared \nto the one that's been trained directly \non PubMed papers and I look at the topic \nspaces of two different models have you \nexplored this kind of thing yeah so \nthat's also often what you see happening \nwith something like the topic is that \nthere are a lot of embedding techniques \nthat you can use \nand I should benefit to that because you \nknow you can use it for your specific \nuse case and you can check what what \nfits but there's also the disadvantages \nwhich that with that in that \nyou know you can end up with quite \ndifferent topics and uh then the \nquestion Becomes of course which one is \ncorrect \nnow the definition of correct as we \nmentioned is difficult because who \ndecides what is the correct topic and \nwho doesn't but the main thing here I \nthink is that you consciously and \npurposefully choose which embedding \ntechnique you use \nand \nyou know some might represent it better \nthan others but it's you who choose for \na very specific method for very specific \nreasons and that can be because you have \nfine-tuned the model on your specific \ndata and you've tested it with a \npre-trained general model that doesn't \ncapture that domain as well as you \nthought it would \num you can also throw a lot of models \nyou know in in their topic or something \nelse and see what comes out \nbut then you run a little bit the risk \nof you know choice overloads you have so \nmany choices you don't know what what to \ndo and what to choose \nand then you know I give a lot of \num responsibility to to the users it's \nup to them to decide okay I'm gonna use \nthis model for this and these Reasons \nI'm \nyou know trying to motivate the users to \nreally think about Which models are you \ngoing to be using and why are you using \nthat specific model do you understand \nthe model do you know that when you use \nyou know uh TF IDF as your input \ndocuments that you're constrained with \nyour vocabulary but if you use fast task \nfast text you have a little bit more you \nknow flexibility with respect to those \nwords and if you use long former then \nyou can use a little bit longer \ndocuments instead of you know the \nregular Transformer models that that \nhave small token limits and if you use \ncertain sentence Transformer models are \nrather fast and and others are very slow \nuh the ones are some are more accurate \nsome more are trained to more data \nthis is tricky and it's sucky that there \nisn't a single solution \nbut that's just the way it is \num and as such it's up to the user to \nreally dive deep into okay this is my \ndata and for this data I think this type \nof embedding more would work best \nyeah it's extremely it's such an \ninteresting interpretability of the \nmodels to see where how they're \nclustering things what they think are \nthe nearest neighbors of things and so \nsomething that I want to pick your brain \nabout also is how do you evaluate the \ntopic models that there are benchmarks \nthis is the different things \nyeah so I've gotten this question quite \na lot before that's all right because \nwhenever you you know develop a model \npeople are gonna ask is it accurate is \nit performant is it doing what what we \nwant to be doing \nand \nmy answer is also it's always uh you \nknow maybe not the most fulfilling \nanswer but it depends because \nwhat does it mean to have a a good topic \nmodel does it mean that the topic \ncoherence is as best as it could be so \nthat the topics you know are easily \ninterpretable by by humans does it mean \nthat \nthe right documents are are clustered in \nthe right clusters does it mean that \nit's performant you know I I we could \nmaybe create a model that runs for two \nweeks or create one that runs in a few \nhours \num there's also new valuation metric we \ncan optimize for diversity for topic \ndiversity uh we can optimize for \nadd depends also on on the underlying \nalgorithm right if you use something \nlike a means how many topics are going \nto optimize for and what does it mean to \nto have 100 topics versus 50. \nbecause you know for some use cases you \njust want 20 topics or so and with HTTP \nscan you kind of have to tweak to make \nsure you get roughly around that 20. \nand you can fine tune based on that \nso so it really depends on the use cases \nbut what I would generally recommend to \ndo is talk with your stakeholder stock \nwith your audience talk with the people \nwho are actually going to be you know \nusing this model reading about this \nmodel \num \nthey are the ones who need to do \nsomething with that so for my use cases \nin in clinical researcher and clinical \nresearch I talk with medical \nprofessionals I show them \nyou know something that I thought was \nlogical a number of topics a number of \ngranularity also with respect to those \ntopics that can also be evaluation \nmetrics and I often then tell me that's \nwrong \nand that's fine because that helps me \nreally iterate and see okay it's it's \nnot granular enough they have very \nspecific demands that's fine sell 50 \ntopics we're gonna do 200 and see if \nthat's makes a little bit more sense \num \nso I I really want want to do it but \nthere isn't one topic evaluation metric \nuh that works best because also well \nwhat is the definition of best in the \ncontext of topic modeling that really \ndepends \nyeah super definitely like a human in \nthe loop a strong component to it and I \nI think maybe like when we would present \na human a surge system and we'd say hey \ndoes this query document pair match so \nit's like well relative to what else and \nit's like maybe you show a query in a \ndocument but then so you want to show \nlike documents two three four as well \nand it's like these very long paragraphs \nattacks it's like I can't read through \nthis whereas if you have the keyword \nlist so it's like query and then keyword \nlist comparative keyword lists maybe \nthat's a better way to like get a human \njudgment \nor something like that no no I I \ndefinitely uh agree with that because \nthe thing is we're still we're still \nhumans and we're lazy we're not going to \nread through hundreds and hundreds of \ndocuments to see if everything matches \nup so so things you can do of course is \nyou know you have a topic you have \ncertain keywords you read through those \nkeywords you think \nyeah I'm not still I'm still not sure \nwhat this is about and then you can show \na few maybe randomly sampled documents \nand not too many but just a few together \nan intuitive understanding of oh it \nmeans these in these kind of models and \nthese these uh types of topics can then \nbe extracted from those \num so so it's still you know like you \nmentioned a way of approaching it taking \na perspective from the user \nhow can you make sure that they have the \neasiest time making sure that everything \nworks as intended \nthat is the approach of the topic it of \ncourse doesn't always succeed in that so \nthat's what development is for \num but also that that iteration and that \nfeedback process to make sure that \num \nthat makes it a little bit easier for \nthe user to understand what is happening \nand for that I provide many many \nfunctions maybe too many you know \nvisualizations uh diving deep into \ncertain topics \nbut it's always nice if you're just \npresented with you know the keywords and \njust a bunch of documents and say okay \nokay these make sense these do not make \nsense just from you know a single glance \nat those topics and those keywords so \nthat is the intention \nbut it doesn't always succeed in that \nyeah it was I mean it's super \ninteresting I think there are so many \napplications for doing this Vector \nanalysis this way of bubbling up the \nkeywords and then having that be kind of \nlike the layer above it that lets you \nsee the Clusters I think that's just \nbrilliant uh could we kind of for my \nunderstanding could we get into the two \nuh could you explain to me what dynamic \ntopic modeling is yeah sure so what is \nessentially what you're doing is uh you \nhave your topic modeling and let's say \nyou get a topic from that and the topic \nis about cars so you have a bunch of \ntweets uh the in those tweets you find a \ntopic about cars and you think okay \nthat's interesting we have something \nabout car great \nnow the thing with tweets is is that \nthere's a timestamp attached to it and \nthat might be interesting because the \nway we talk about cars today and a few \nyears ago might be entirely different \nthe topic is still exactly the same it's \nstill about cars but today Tesla is way \nmore popular than it was a few years ago \nfor example \nso we're still talking about the same \nthing about the same same concept the \nsame topic cars \nbut the way we talk about this that is \ndifferent and you know you can do that \nin a dynamic way so \num over time that you see if a certain \ntopic has increased popularity over time \nand if it has it's the way we talk about \nthat topic different but you can also \nsplit thin classes for example so if we \nhave a certain political topic uh China \nfor example then Obama would talk quite \ndifferently than Trump about that topic \nit's still the same topic they still \ntalk about China in a certain way but \nthe way they approach is it might be \nentirely different and the entire ID \nwith Dynamic topic modeling and for \nexample cloud-based topic morning is \nthat we say okay we have a certain time \nstamp \nfor our documents \nand we take only the documents in that \ntimestamp and then do the CTF IDF \nanalysis on top of that \nwe don't have to do clustering anymore \nwe don't have to do any of those \nembedding steps we can simply slice up \nour data a little bit further so we \nstill have the same cars topic but \ninstead of this entire line we're taking \nthis small step \nand from that we essentially say okay \nwe're going to recalculate the ct5df \nrepresentation and maybe it's different \nin order to not have to recalculate the \nClusters you would need to have say 2014 \nto 2020 in the initial set and then you \ncan 2018 to 2020 slice right \nyeah that's super interesting one of my \nthings was to ask about how the topics \nevolve over time and see a dynamic topic \nbeing the phrase to describe that and \nyeah that is just amazing especially \nlike as you think about continual \nlearning data Centric Ai and managing \nthese data sets how are they evolving \nyou know if we're searching through \nsoftware support tickets uh for Wii day \nlet's say and then we introduce a new \nfeature and then we see how the \ndiscussion evolves around it over time \nhelps us to like search and understand \nthe just our data set of support tickets \nopen uh so now can we dive into online \ntopic modeling and what that means yeah \nso that's very similar to to what you've \nmentioned before right so uh if you get \na bunch of topics or sorry a bunch of \ntickets for for your software that you \nhave you can do Dynamic topic modeling \non that and that's when you already have \nall of that data and you just see if \nthere's a trend but you know there is a \nTomorrow there's new data coming in \nthere and you might want to know a \nlittle bit more about these new topics \nor this new data whether the Clusters \nchange or whether they become more about \nsomething entirely different \nwithin the same topic of course so what \nonline learning is doing is basically \nsidekits scikit-learns partial fit \nfunction it's when you train your data \nset on a small part and then you \ncontinuously update it whenever new data \ncomes in to make sure the for example \nthe Clusters get better aligned whether \nit discovers new topics which which is \nalso possible \num and and the basic usage for that is \nagain rather straightforward because \nwe have a pre-trained language model we \ndon't need to necessarily fine tune that \nfor for new data that comes in \num it generally captures the rep station \nwell uh with a small side note of course \nthat if you know there are models \ntrained before covid so whenever kovit \ncomes in it can have difficulty \ncapturing that but setting that aside we \ncan then use for example incremental PCA \nto continuously update how they should \nbe you know reducing dimensionality we \ncan use many batch k-means to \ncontinuously update the k-means \nrepresentation \nsctf IDF is is rather straightforward \nthat's just recalculating it \nand then there's a gun factorized step \nbefore that to make sure that whenever \nnew words come in we simply add it to \nthe bag of words \nand that sets you know you don't have to \ndo much to make sure it gets updated \nand the one thing to note here is that \nyou can introduce a Decay Factor \nbecause if we have trained for the last \n10 years on some data \nand now suddenly a new topic comes in \nthen we still have 10 years data of \nworth in our topic model so so what \nhappens if you have you know back and \nforth representation with 10 years of \ndata it tends to focus on those 10 years \nof data because it's quite a lot and \nthat small new data that comes in \ndoesn't really get that much attention \nso you can introduce a Decay Factor by \nessentially saying so whenever we update \nthe model all all data \ngets a little bit smaller because it's \nback of words it's a count right we \ndecrease the count width one or two \npercent \nso it doesn't get slowly smaller and \nsmaller and smaller all the older data \nand newer data gets a little bit more \nattention and becomes therefore also a \nlittle bit more accurate \nthat's super yeah as we've been thinking \nabout the design of bird topic and we V8 \nand how interface this that really made \nme think about like the symbolic filter \nlike adding them as like a wear filter \nfor year after 2018 that kind of thing \nwould be really important to the design \nand this whole conversation has been \nreally enlightening to thinking about \nthe design of trying to build this kind \nof vector analysis in weeviate and what \npeople will need um so you mentioned you \nhave this user perspective and you're \nbuilding the bird topic it's a python \nLibrary can you tell me about your \nexperience building out that library \nthat was a very interesting experience \nit's it's the I think one of the first \npackages that I developed outside of my \nMaster's thesis \num and it has been quite a ride for uh \nfor the last few years because there are \na lot of dependency issues uh because of \nnumpy some other uh things that were \nneed to taken into account but it was \nreally really interesting really fun to \ndo because there's so many people that \nwant to contribute to the package that \nhave very interesting suggestions \num by focusing on those users and by \nfocusing on what their experience is \nwith the model I make it more than just \nsomething \nfor myself right I don't I don't want to \nbring out a package that I'm only using \nmyself I'm not doing it just for me \num and because there are a lot of people \nusing that uh you know I need to listen \nto them I need to make sure that \nI take into account the features \nthat are looking for the experience that \nthey look for \num so for me that psychological \nbackground I think has helped \ntremendously in not only listening to \nthe feedback that has been giving but \nalso taking their perspective and also \nunderstanding okay if I gonna write \ndocumentation for example how should I \ndo that how should I make sure that \nyou know when I communicate certain \nConcepts I do that clearly and in a \nwell-explained manner and obviously I \ndon't always succeed in doing that and I \nsee that back in the issues which is \ngreat because then I see okay there are \nway too many issues about this even \nthough I think it's clearly in the \ndocumentation uh that means I'm wrong \nit's not clearly in the documentation I \nI should re-examine it you know and look \nfor ways to improve it ask for feedback \nthings like that \nit's a very similar experience with \nkeyboard and polyfuss where you know \nthere's a focus on transparency \nmodularity user experience these kind of \nthings \nall of these packages they're not \nnecessarily the most state-of-the-art \nthe most complex \nuh algorithms out there that nobody \nunderstands now we're going back to \neasily explainable topic modeling \ntechniques or or packages giving control \nback to the developers having them \ngiving giving them the opportunity to \nbuild whatever it is that they want to \ndo you know we might to say that you \nshould do your topic modeling and this \nin this way I don't know every use case \nI don't know what you're working on and \nwho am I to say what it should look like \nso that has mostly been the the design \nphilosophy behind these packages and \nsometimes they work because it gives a \nlot of options to uh to developers \nsometimes it gives a little bit too many \noptions as a choice overload which can \nbe difficult and balancing that out \nhaving a great out of debug experience \nwhile still giving you know thousands of \noptions so to say \nthat has been that has been tricky \nbecause it doesn't always align with one \nanother and yeah you know you have to \nmake some hard choices here and there \nyeah super cool well yeah and I I do \nthink kind of in the space of topic \nmodeling there are like these LDA like \nMatrix factorization approaches and I \nthink kind of these steps of uh you know \nbird embeddings new map compression hdb \nscan tfid I think that stack is a little \nmore approachable than having to \nconstruct a big topic term and then you \nknow singular value decomposition to get \nout \nand I also really want to compliment you \non your medium articles that explain \nbird topic for because I you know I \ndidn't really know that this kind of \nthing existed and your articles are just \nsuper clear on helping me get up to \nspeed with this so I definitely want to \nthank you for that thank you and I think \nin general you've documented this \nextremely well the python library is so \ninteresting there's so much to look \nthrough so many interesting topics with \nthis I think it's a huge idea for \nunderstanding Vector spaces and all the \napplications we've talked about so \nMartin thank you so much for joining the \nweba podcast I'm so happy with this one \nI think this so much information with it \nand I couldn't be more excited about the \ndevelopment of bird topic and leviate oh \nthank you very nice being here talking \nabout it to you about this a really nice \nconversation and as always if there's \nany feedback that you have anything that \nyou find okay this is stupid you should \nchange it tell me because I'm really \nopen to anything I cannot make any \nguarantees of course but I'll do my best \nThanks Martin \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Maarten Grootendorst on BERTopic - Weaviate Podcast
