{"text": "Thank you so much for tuning into the first episode of our LlamaIndex and Weaviate series! This episode will show you how to ... \nhey everyone welcome to the first \nepisode of the Loma index and weavate \nintegration in this video I'll be going \nover an overview of what llama index is \ngo over the various data loaders that \nthey have hosted on the Llama Hub then \nI'll share how to load data and \nalleviate using llama index and then how \nto connect llama index to your already \nexisting weave instance I also share a \nfew ways to run review if you're not \nfamiliar so you can use sweepy embedded \nuse WCS which allows you to have to run \na 14-day free sandbox and then also how \nto run it on Docker so running it \nlocally so these are just a few options \nthat you can use to run revade and also \nget started with your application with \nusing we beat and llama index together \nand then also share this in the review \nrecipes I'll include a link in the \ndescription but this is really where I \njust share an end to end uh Notebook on \na few features that we have in weviate \nbut then also with our integration \nPartners as well all right so let's jump \ninto the video This Is The Notebook that \nI'll be sharing under the Wii V8 recipes \nrepository so make sure you follow along \nand go under Integrations llama Index \nepisode one and then you can follow \nalong from there so this is the overview \nthat I already went over so I want to \nDive Right into what Loma index is so \nLama index is a framework that enables \nyou to connect other LMS and storage \nproviders together and when I see \nstorage providers I am referencing \nabbreviate the open source Vector \ndatabase so while llama index and vv8 \ntogether make the ultimate retrieval \naugmented generation stack is because \nthe large language models don't have \naccess to your specific data but when \nused Lama index and we meet together \nyou're essentially \nsupplying the llm with the data that is \nstored in your database so this is \nallowing you to make queries that are \nspecific to your company like uh how \nlong do I have to give my company my \nresignation letter or that's maybe a \nhorrible example but you kind of you get \nthe gist \num so one cool thing about llama index \nis their llama Hub so it it's um it's a \nhub that has all of the various data \nloaders whether this be slack PDF \ndocuments YouTube notion which I show in \nthis demo uh PowerPoints essentially all \nof these different data sources can be \nfed into your vector database and that \nis the first part that I show is how to \nload data into leviate using llama index \nand then also the other way around \num so with that being said let's get \ninto the demo so for those of you that \ndon't have an existing VB instance \nrunning there are three options to get \nthis started \num so you can use we be embedded which \nallows you to run it directly in your \napplication the only requirement is that \nyour python client is up to date so just \nmake sure is that minimum 3.21 and then \nrunning be embedded will work if not \nthere are a few other options if that \nmaybe isn't the best uh way for you to \ndo that the other option is using our BB \ncloud service so you can create an \naccount and then from there create a BB \ninstance and what's really cool about \nthis is that it's a 14 day free sandbox \nwhich really allows you to get started \nand like test the botters with Vector \ndatabases \num so that's one option so run it \ncompletely free and then also embedded \nin Docker also free so whichever way \nwhichever method works for you best \num so once you create your bb instance \nin the console uh you'll pass in your \nurl right here so I have my llama Index \nepisode one uh working and then you pass \nin your open AI key here and for \nsecurity and financial reasons I have it \nhidden and then also if you create your \nsandbox and it has authorization you can \nalso pass it in right here \num but for this demo I don't have that \nenabled \nlastly you can run review using Docker \nSo within this llama index folder I have \na gamble file and if you could just grab \nthat run it and then it should be \nworking and running at localhost 8080. \nso those are like three options to run \nwheat feet if you don't already have a \nrepeat instance running \nanother requirement to get weave set up \nis to build out your schema and so what \nI'm doing here in this cell is just \nbuilding my blog post class and then I'm \npassing in my content property and what \nthe content is is just a text that is \nwithin each blog post and I guess I \ndidn't make this clear before but I'm \nusing the bb8 blogs as my data set \num so yeah make sure you check that out \nas well adding data to webva using llama \nindex is actually super easy using their \nvarious data loaders so in this video \nI'm covering three uh ways to load in \ndata using the simple directory reader \nbut then also the web page reader and \nthen loading in documents from notion \nbut if you want to use maybe slack or \nPDFs or YouTube videos I'd recommend \ngoing to llama Hub because you can see \nlike the various ways to use those data \nloaders okay so starting off with \nDecember directory reader what this is \ndoing is just reading files in your file \nsystem \num so I have all of the rev8 blog posts \nin my data folder and I'm just going to \nload that in as easy as that the next \nway to do this as well as using this \nsimple web page reader so it's a web \nscraper that turns HTML to text so just \nto show you to give you a feel of how to \ndo this \num I just passed in the Wii Vape blog \nand then the Llama index and weave blog \npost and it's an easy way to load in \ndata from websites \nthe other option is to use the notion \npage reader so it loads documents in \nfrom notion and why this is so cool is \nbecause you can actually convert notion \ndocuments into markdown and I'm not sure \nif that's like a new feature or maybe \nI've been under a rock but that's really \ncool because now you don't have to go \nthrough the manual effort of converting \nblog posts that are on Google or maybe \nnotion as well and converting that into \nmarkdown so this is a really cool option \nif you want to give that a try so at the \nnotion page reader is doing is using \nyour integration token so if you're a \nworkspace owner or admin you can create \nan integration and then you'll just pass \nin your secret key here next with the \npage ID is so if you go to notion.so and \nthen navigate to the document that you \nwant to load in the URL will end with \nthis code mixed up numbers and letters \nand then you just paste that into here \nand then it's as easy as that to load in \ndocuments from notion which is great now \nthat we have our data we're going to \nwant to chunk it up so we don't run into \nthe limited token length problem so Lama \nindex has a simple node parser and what \nthis is doing is just chunking up your \ndata so our blog posts in this demo into \nnodes \nnext we're going to want to take those \nnotes and upload it to eviate um so by \ndoing that we need to construct our \nVector store so here we have our weave \nclient and you're setting that equal to \nclient which is either a few are running \nit with embedded with a WCS instance or \nlocally \nyou're just going to want to connect \nthat rebate instance to \num you're going to want to connect that \nwe beat instance here to construct the \nvector store and then what the index \nname is is just the class that we \ncreated so in our example we are using \nblog post which we defined in our schema \nand then we have text key which is \ncontent and that's the property that we \ndefined in the schema as well \nnow we want to set up the storage for \narm bettings that's what we're doing is \njust passing in the vector store which \nwe just defined here because we're using \nthe weviate database next we just want \nto set up the index so we're just taking \nthe nodes and then setting up that \nstorage equal to what we had just \ndefined here and that's really the last \nstep that you need to get started with \nuploading data into alleviate using \nllama index now that we have our data in \nour weave instance I want to build a \nsimple query engine so I'm doing this by \nsetting by using the index that we just \nbuilt and passing in my query so I'm \nasking what is the intersection between \na lumps and search and where I want this \nto retrieve this information from is \nfrom my weebe database and to be a \nlittle bit more specific I want it to \nfetch the blog post where I'm talking \nabout a lumps and search and Conor and I \njust published that blog post maybe like \na few weeks back so it's kind of \ninteresting to see how it answers this \nso it's saying that the intersection \nbetween alarms and search is the ability \nto use alums to improve search \ncapabilities such as frag query \nunderstanding index construction and \nlens and rewracking \nEtc if you would like to actually read \nthe blog post I'd recommend checking it \nout but it's really cool how you can \nbuild such a simple uh Engine with llama \nindex the other option is to query using \nthe VBA console \nso up here I'm connecting to my weevied \ninstance and then I'm just running a \nsimple hybrid search and for those of \nyou who aren't familiar with what hybrid \nsearch is it's taking bm25 which is \nkeyword search and Vector search and \ncombining it together and it's doing \nthis waiting by this Alpha parameter so \nAlpha set to zero it's pure bm25 and \nAlpha set to one it is pure Vector \nsearch so setting it to 0.75 or 75 is \nskewing more towards per Vector search \nbut this is just something that you can \ntoy around with for your application uh \nbut for this I just set it to 0.75 all \nright so once it but it's going to \nreturn is a Content so just a text that \nis within the blog post and again my \nquery is the intersection between a lens \nand search so I wanted to grab the blog \nposts that where we talk about this and \nit's doing exactly that here \num so it's passing in or it's uh \noutputting the elements in search blog \nposts which is great another thing to \nnote is that you can pass in your openai \nkey and the header down here because we \nneed to vectorize our query and yeah \nthat's it that's one way to back your \neye oh sorry that's one way to query in \nllama index and in mediate for those of \nyou who already have your weave instance \nrunning and you just want to add llama \nindex to it this is the way to do it so \nyou just want to use the web reader \nwhich you can actually see the \ndocumentation on this and the Llama Hub \num or just follow along with this \nnotebook but you want to connect to WCS \nor pass in your localhost 8080 if you're \nusing Docker so you just sign in with \nyour username and password and then pass \nin the URL to your rebate instance and \nthen documents what this is is just your \nschema so I'm taking my blog post class \nand then passing in AI content property \nnow that I have run that you can now \num \nquery or you can now upload and query \nthe existing class that you already have \nall set \num so I'm again passing in the URL so \nthat my we beat reader knows which \ninstance to connect to and then I'm \nbuilding out my query so I want blog \nposts about that explain what reftubec \nis and I want it to search on the \ncontent property limiting it to two and \nonly outputting the content \nall right so now that I have my \ndocuments I need to build out the index \nand then I simply just run my uh query \nengine so again I'm asking what is \nreftubec \nand it says crafty bike is a machine \nlearning algorithm that uses NLP to \ngenerate Vector representation of text \nreferences \num that's a little debatable but it was \nable to answer so that's one way to \nquery in a llama index but then again \nyou can also query in the console so if \nI ask in the console what is rough to \nback using your text passing in my open \nAI key because we need to vectorize that \nyou can see that it will output the blog \npost that is about rough tebec and why \nyou need it for your recommendation \nsystem so if you'd like to learn more \nabout what ref tibec is I'd recommend \nchecking out our documentation thanks so \nmuch for watching the first episode of \nthe weeviate and llama index integration \nstay tuned for future videos where I'll \nbe covering how you can build more \nadvanced guides with using llama index \nand movie together to really build that \nultimate rag stack and then also if \nyou'd like to follow along with the \nnotebook don't forget to head over to \nthe weeviate recipes repository where \nyou can download this notebook and \nparticularly or also just learn more \nabout various features and mediate again \nI cover end to end notebook Demos in \nthat repository and then also make sure \nyou like And subscribe and tune in for \nthe next video bye \n", "type": "Video", "name": "LlamaIndex and Weaviate - Episode 1: Data Loading", "path": "",
