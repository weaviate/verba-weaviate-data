{"text": "I am so excited to host Dmitry Kan on the Weaviate Podcast!! Dmitry is a world class expert on emerging trends in search ... \nhey everyone I'm super excited to be \npublishing our latest podcast with \nDimitri Khan we're discussing some of \nhis latest Works around his keynote talk \nat the haystack European conference and \nthis latest blog post on neural search \nFrameworks a head-to-head comparison so \nI think it would help a lot to see the \nvisual that Dimitri's created to \ndescribe the neural search pyramid so \nyou see from this visual of the uh the \npyramid going from the parks and nearest \nneighbor algorithms to the vector \ndatabases neural Frameworks encoders and \napplication business logic and user \ninterface so a big part of this podcast \nis going to be Dimitri and I debating \nthese components uh you know what should \ngo where and then sort of the \nabstractions around it but hopefully \nthis visual helps a lot with what we're \ngoing to discuss in the podcast I also \nthought this would be the perfect \npodcast to debut the Wii V8 podcast \nsearch app searching through the wevia \npodcast with weaviate of course so \nhere's the GitHub repository with the \nEva podcast search all you would need to \ndo is clone this repository then run \nDocker compose upd and then python3 \nrestore.pi to restore the backup with \nthe full transcript with this podcast \nwith Dimitri in it so I'm really curious \nwhat people think about these two lines \nof code for restoring data sets because \nthis is kind of the thinking so far \naround how we're planning to package up \nthe beer data sets so if you've test \nthis out please let us know how you \nthink about this experience and I really \nhope you enjoy searching through the \npodcast so once you're running the \npodcast search app and weaviate you can \nask it all sorts of questions like what \nis the neural surge pyramid and it'll \nsemantically match it with the part of \nthe conversation that talks about it and \nall sorts of other topics that were \nmentioned in the podcast so maybe if you \ndon't have time to listen to the entire \nhour and 45 minute podcast you can just \nsearch through it with the wevia podcast \nsearch app so thanks so much for \nchecking this out and I really hope you \nenjoy the podcast hey everyone thank you \nso much for checking out the weva \npodcast I am beyond excited for this \nepisode we have Dimitri Khan one of the \nmost influential speakers in search \ntechnology Dimitri is the host of the \nvector podcast he's a senior product \nmanager at TomTom and he's recently \ngiven this incredible keynote uh the \nhaystack European conference 2022 so \nfirstly Dimitri thank you so much for \njoining the weba podcast hey Connie \nthanks for having me it's always it was \nalways a pleasure to talk to you \nawesome so could we maybe kick things \noff with uh the big the keynote where \nVector searches uh taking us and some of \nthe key ideas behind that yeah for sure \nuh so the keynote I had an honor to give \nthis keynote at the haystack conference \nas you mentioned in Berlin in late \nSeptember last year and uh we've been a \nbunch of uh actually people from Vector \nsearch Community including bb8 and \nPinecone and quadrant and also users \nthis was especially interesting to see \nhow far ahead users gotten and they \nthey've been asking very precise \nquestions you know like how do I choose \na model and and which database to prefer \nand so on and so forth this was very \ninteresting and some of them have been \nalready trying things and so in that \nsense \nI wouldn't say like a year ago maybe I \nfelt like I could \num share more and educate more and even \nexplain the basics uh nowadays it's more \nlike okay we already we already \nunderstand the basics okay can you \nexplain what what what practical step I \ncan take to actually Implement Vector \nsearch or I have tried you know doctor \nquery it doesn't work that well what \nshould I do you know and one of the key \npoints in the \num in the Keynote \nuh key points in the keynote I have uh \nhad was uh this um work that was done by \nmckinsian and and Google in 2021 so \nalmost like two years ago now \nuh where they call out the issue of \nsearch abandonment costs in for the U.S \nretailers so it's only U.S retail \num which kind of like loses 300 billion \ndollars a year uh and and why they do \nthis why why this happens is because of \nthe search abandonment issue so you know \npractically speaking \nusers start typing it you know a query \nthey probably see some autocomplete some \nsome Dynamics going on on the website \nthen they check the results and they \ncannot find what they look for and we \ndiscuss with you in the vector podcast \njust recently \num that the query language the the user \nlanguage is so different right user to \nuser \num I have a bunch of examples on this \nfront as well when when when search and \ne-commerce doesn't work \num \nand so \nwhat's interesting also is that \n64 percent 64 of retail website managers \ndo not have a clear plan for improvement \nso they kind of lose the money they \ndon't know what to do with it how to fix \nthis and that's like more than half of \nthem right it's like a big big number \num and another issue that kind of \nsurfaces now that I have this product \nmanagement had on \num \nit's interesting to see that 85 percent \nof global online consumers view a brand \ncompletely differently after this search \nis unsuccessful so in some sense the \nbrands themselves have nothing to do \nwith the search engine which is \nbasically like let's say an aggregator \nor whatever like Amazon type of thing \nright but like if search doesn't work \nthey are they think it's brand problem \nbecause they cannot find the item they \nare looking for right and so they change \ntheir perception of the Brand This is \nhow important it is to make the search \nwork \nyeah yeah it's super fascinating is it \nreminds me maybe like these kind of \nnumbers there's something about like \nmaybe 98 of data is private and the \nmotivation of the sort of indexing and \nsearching through private data and as as \nwell as this retail thing like having \nthese kind of numbers but \num I'm kind of thinking like so with the \nretail and fixing it is it the \nresponsibility of the brands like whose \nresponsibility is it to implement these \nThe Cutting Edge search engines I mean \nyou know we think like with alleviated \nit's our responsibility to build it and \nmake it available and you see it as \nbeing like more uh more independent uh \ne-commerce retail stores so like not \njust Amazon you know being sort of the \nfront layer but more and more uh \nindividual retail sites taking on uh you \nknow this pipeline of as we'll talk \nabout neural surge Frameworks like \nhaving their own uh we V8 Gina AI kind \nof setup yeah I think that's that's an \nexcellent question and I think it kind \nof like depends on the situation the \nPractical situation with engineering and \nand sort of \num assets and resources that this \ncompany has and also like the focus that \nthey want to have right in some cases \ncompanies might want to like Outsource \nthis and just ask somebody to build it \nfor them and and this is this is an \ninteresting opportunity you know for \num players like for example semi or \novestpa you know if if you guys have a \ncloud offering which is kind of like end \nto end \nyou know solving a particular issue for \nyou know starting from actually creating \nthe embeddings all the weight of all \nthese backups every infra element is \ntaking out care of and then on top of \nthis you can actually prove that you \nknow I can actually retrieve the the \num the items with with higher relevancy \nthen I would do myself because what does \nit mean for me to make it myself I would \nstart like scrambling reading stack \nOverflow hiring engineers and that's \nlike a long path right and maybe I'd \nrather pay money and just get to the \nmarket sooner \nand so I think uh that's an excellent \nquestion but there's another facet to \nthis um I guess is it like in your \nquestion is it Brands \num concern or is it like uh uh let's say \na neural search framework a vector \ndatabase concern or is it like a \nretailer concern in some sense I think \nit's like a it's a joint ecosystem right \nit's not like you can just say hey \nplease fix me the house and and I'll pay \nyou but they might fix it their own way \nthey might also break some things while \nthey do this but you are paying so money \ndon't always buy everything so I I think \nI still believe that \nit's better if these players would \ncollaborate in some ways for example you \nknow if we're talking talking about \nneural search implementation you know \nwhat's important is like for example how \nyou catalog an item what metadata you \nhave right and so and also how up to \ndate it is right so somebody needs to be \nsupplying this data to you and so maybe \nthe brands could be supplying this data \nto you as they change to introduce new \nproducts \num but then everything else you know the \npipeline should be already in place and \nit should be easy to use you know be it \nan API or some other way like Amazon I \nremember they they have an office they \nhave a service of delivering data on \ntracks right because it's much faster is \nit deliver on trucks than to upload it \nbecause it's a lot of data \nbut if it's like a medium-sized store \nlike maybe you don't need a truck to \ndeliver your data you know on batch \nlevel or whatever like you could build \nan API \num I hope I answered I answer your \nquestion there is another another \nanother perspective also to keep in mind \neven if you have the engineering force \nin place like in-house \nbuilding uh like if you take like an \nopen source database \nor open source neural framework it might \ntake you a while to to gain the you know \nto to accumulate the knowledge to gain \nthe momentum to realize okay this is \nwhat we can build from POC to actually \nproductizing this \num maybe it's easier if you just go and \nkind of like Outsource this resource \nthis cost to a managed database like in \ncase of vbait or in case of Pinecone \num \nand focus on something else right focus \non that specific you know cataloging \nissue or maybe bringing a classifier \nthat will do the product classification \non the Fly and things like that right \nit's kind of like put your effort and \nfocus on what matters \nand then later maybe you can change your \nmind you know the moment you grow maybe \nyou will decide to build your own Vector \ndatabase but but before you before that \nhappened you need to kind of like pay \nyour bills right and so don't don't get \nahead of yourself and also if you \npartner with a clever you know player \nwhich is like we have a lot of them now \non the market \num \nyou know you might win and they will \nalso learn you will learn together so I \nthink that that's an interesting \nperspective to to also think about \nyeah it's a it's a brilliant way to open \nup this kind of as we're also talking \nabout neural surge Frameworks and you've \nwritten this great blog post that \noutlines a different neural surge \nFrameworks and as you mentioned I mean \nit's just a you did a brilliant job just \ncovering it and this idea of uh you know \nthe overhead for learning it the \nlearning curve is something being \nsomething that's important and at \nweviate there's a huge focus on uh ux \nand being developer friendly creating \ncontent to try to educate especially \nwith the new releases we try to have \neven alleviate Air Show to you know try \nto explain how to use all the stuff and \nwhat it is as much as possible and I \nthink this is going to be such an \ninteresting discussion because it's \nthere there are parts of it that are \nthat should live outside of leviate I \nthink parts that I think maybe should be \nbuilt into weed and I also want to just \nquickly set this up before we get into \nit that like this what I say on the \npodcast about the relationship of \nwebgate and neural search Frameworks is \nmy personal opinion it's not like an \nofficial statement of with respect to \nlike \nhow I see what should be built where so \nI really want to kind of transition this \ninto maybe we could kind of do the tour \nof the neural search framework starting \noff by maybe just the high level of how \nare you currently defining a neural \nsearch framework oh yeah that's that's \nan excellent question and and maybe I \ncan also intro like I created this you \nknow mental diagram for myself and I \nkept selling it everywhere and seems \nlike people get it and some of them even \nlike reach out on LinkedIn and say hey I \ngot your vector search pyramid thank you \nfor creating it but really I you know my \ngoal was just to put things in their \nplace like on a bookshelf so you can \nlike reach out and and and and give \ncontext and and and and ground your \ndiscussion and so in this Vector search \npyramid which probably can also share \nyou know essentially like on the base on \nthe base level you have the KN and a n \nalgorithms and to some extent I also \ncovered some of them not all of them you \nknow I know that Pinecone for example \ndid a great job publishing a lot of \nmaterial on this you know how each \nalgorithm works we also happen to invent \none algorithm by gpq which is just a \nmodification of product quantization \num and then the next the next layer and \nI did publish a year ago now a Blog \nabout not all Vector databases are made \nequal and so you have mailbox bb8 \nPinecone you know GSI quadrant Vespa \nbald and also those players that kind of \nlike yeah I I didn't find yet the proper \nphrase I I kind of say catch up but on \nthe other hand \nit's not like ketchup it's like being \nbald and actually going into this space \nfor existing databases like uh redis and \nelasticsearch and solar and they add \nVector search functionality as well for \ntheir users and then there was this next \nlayer that I couldn't like quite wrap my \nhead around and I was thinking what \nexactly is this and of course genome \nand Haystack sort of like in some sense \nthe pioneers of of creating the \nterminology and so I think at some point \nthey were calling themselves neural \nsearch Frameworks \num recently I saw that Gina is calling \nthemselves something like amylopes for \nneural search so so of course these \nthings morph but but I kind of like \ndecided to stay with the same term like \nneural search framework and I kind of \nlabeled every system I could come across \nbut there are some exceptions as well by \nthe way there and I'll get there but \nbasically \nthe way I Define it and I guess we can \nshare the the blog post itself is that \nbasically reading from the blog neural \nsearch framework is an end-to-end \nsoftware layer that allows you to create \na neural search experience including \ndata processing model serving and \nscaling capabilities in the production \nsetting \nso like just to unpack this \nso let's say if you take a SQL database \nand you want to build a website right \nyou will still need to figure out okay \nwhere do you get the data how do you \nprocess it before it gets in the SQL \ndatabase then how do you normalize the \ntables if you do that right like foreign \nkeys and all this thing which index type \nto choose and things like that so so \nthat it actually breatheses and works \nand can scale \num but like this definition may sound to \nsome people as uh Emma lops machine \nlearning operations \nbut there is a key difference that first \nof all mlops it's like a wide area it's \nit's a wide field you know it it \nconcerns itself with a lot of things \nlike I don't know model training you \nknow model versioning deployments \nserving monitoring you know data drift \nfine-tuning a lot of a lot of things \nright and and the application is also \nquite diverse like I don't know I could \nbe building \num I don't know face recognition system \nor something like that right so but like \nneural search framework focuses only on \nneural search so it's like and and also \nanother question that frequently comes \nup is like what's the difference between \nneural search and Vector search in a way \nthere is no difference it's just like \nhow you take which angle let's say \nneural search you could think of it okay \nI have a deep Learning Network and so \nthat's probably why it's neural because \nit's like deep learning the you know \nneural network \nbut if you take the stance of let's say \ngeometric space right so you you embed \nyour object into multi-dimensional \ngeometric space and now you need to and \neach point is a vector so now you need \nto basically find a vector which is \nrelevant for your query Vector so you \nare doing a vector search right but but \nthis is kind of like mechanics of it \num so yeah I think this is how I Define \nit \nyeah I think I'd want to start with \nconnecting with our earlier conversation \nof the lost money in retail and more and \nmore brand stores trying to build their \nown retails and I'd even maybe extend \nthat to people with their own blogs \nlooking to have searchable things on \ntheir blogs and you know also paying the \nbills and not worrying about this thing \nI kind of want to start off with say \nlike the uh data pre-processing layer \nlike I see kind of with these neural \nsearch Frameworks they Define these \npipelines and I think pipelines is sort \nof the key uh term here and I I'm going \nto talk about what I what other pipeline \nI think should live in weaviate and what \nI think should live outside obviate and \nI think maybe starting off with just \nlike the data ingestion part like maybe \nyou have some kind of API that you query \nto get the data you have maybe like a \nPDF parser with some kind of OCR how are \nyou thinking about that first part of \nthe data ingestion layer because maybe \nif I could just add one more thing to \ntransition the question when and coming \ninto like running things in production \nuh Gina AI they have these executor \npattern and you know I learned a lot \nabout this on the wevia podcast with \nMaximilian work I highly recommend that \nif you're curious about learning more \nabout this pattern for listeners but \nthis kind of way of scheduling like a \nCron job that say you know every two \nhours it's going to query this API like \nor say every day it's going to hit the \narchive API to get the new batch machine \nlearning favors parse out the text and \nchunk it in the PDF then vectorize those \nchunks and and then maybe put that to \nWii game and then yeah I don't want to \nlet's start just on that first part of \nyeah I think it's it's another excellent \nyou know topic to think about because \num I've been Consulting a few startups \nthat are trying to build Vector search \nright and uh they sort of get quickly \nfar ahead you know because they have \nlet's say a database a vector database \nthey have their data obviously they've \nchosen the model to vectorize with \num they're already scratching the \nrelevancy side of things but but then \nsomeone comes in and says hey we just \nreceived another batch of uh objects we \nhave half half a million you know \nobjects to to index can you please index \nthem and and by the way I have a demo \ntomorrow right so so what options do you \nhave right and and and literally some of \nthe developers which would reach out to \nme and say hey any any options anything \nto save this situation and you know like \nof course \num naively what you can do is that you \ncan start writing a python or Java you \nknow concurrent app which will start \nunpacking this you know data sets you \nknow reading from S3 or something like \nthat uh and then vectorizing you hear \nthe problem that oh you need to use GPU \nto speed things up and that's quite \ncostly so we need to kind of like \nrethink a lot of things and not make a \nmistake if we launch this in batch mode \nand it will run for two weeks so you go \nback to your manager and say it's gonna \ntake two weeks and they're like what and \nhow much is it five thousand dollars oh \nmy God so like each time we crawl the \ndata you're gonna need five thousand \ndollars in two weeks it's like going out \nof hand right and so \num especially what you what you \nmentioned in Gina and also there is a \nframework called txtai which I learned \njust you know by kind of like Googling \ninside GitHub if I can say that \nso so they have this notion of \num kind of this workflow \nso for example as you said in Gina you \ncan do \num you you can have an Executor that \nwill uh read uh kind of like an archive \nand and basically iterate PDF files and \nthen transform uh parse the textual \ncontent out of a PDF file and then it \nproceeds to the next stage right \num and and a txti for example also has \nyou know some connectors for other types \nof data like in computer vision space or \nautomatic speech recognition space and \nso they have different like workflows \nthat will help you set things up really \nquickly they have one demo app \num on hugging face spaces uh which \nessentially what it does is that it goes \nto Hacker News front page it scrapes you \nknow the top links \nand then it indexes the titles you know \nof that top page the top on that front \npage and then it shows shows a search \nbox so it basically indexes all these \ntitles you know embeds them uh on the \nFly \num and and and then basically when it's \nready you have the search box appearing \non the screen and now you're ready to \nquery it and so it is that easy and they \nshow you know how easy it is of course \nit's not what you will use in production \nsetting most likely you know like in \nproduction you want to have like a \nworkflow that routinely goes and checks \nthat front page you know like a cron Tab \nand then indexes that and you still have \nthe the index that is serving the \nqueries so you have some offline index \nwhich is being prepared and then you do \nthe swap you know and things like that \nbut they also simplify things like \ndeploying on kubernetes so you can scale \nthings up because like literally if you \nif you write your own python app and one \nof the startups by the way there was a a \nbottleneck specifically in this \ncomponent that would read the objects \none by one and then it would try to \nclassify the object and then embed it \nand then it proceeds to the next step \nand it was like I think it was like \nsingle thread application which would \nkind of like take forever and it was \nvery convoluted right because if you \ndon't have the framework in your hands \nyou start Reinventing the wheel and so \nmost likely you will kind of cut the \ncorners \nand you will be basically wasting time \nunless you have a lot of time which \nusually is not the case in startups like \nyou need to build something really \nquickly \num and so this is this is something that \nI think is probably \num \nyou know hasn't been in the minds \num of the makers maybe like more the \nthan a year ago but I think it becomes \nmore and more important that you don't \njust bring the vector search core \nfunctionality you don't just sell the \nstatement that hey move to neural search \nand all your problems will be solved but \nyou can actually show the path to get \nthere right and with these workflows \nthat process the data access the data \nquickly \num and allow you to do this repeatedly \nis going to win more customers \nyeah and I think um well yeah I'm sorry \nif maybe I'm slowing it down too much \nbut I I think maybe from The Next Step \nif we've gotten the data and now we're \nvectorizing it I kind of want to if we \ncould talk a little more about the \ndecisions with vectorizing the data I \nthink it's so interesting you mentioned \nlike a single thread approach where \nyou're not taking advantage of like \nbatching on the GPU or parallelization \non the CPUs and we've recently added \nthings like Onyx support for the \ntextavec um thanks to March and antis \nwho who got this done and like this kind \nof model inference for the \nvectorization's sake also I mentioned on \nthe vector podcast that I'm really \nexcited about our partnership with \nneural magic and what they're doing to \nsparsify these models so they can run \nsuper fast on CPUs \nand so I'm and maybe one more references \nin our Levy podcast with Sam bean from \nyou.com he describes how they combine uh \nthe spark Big Data technology with the \nOnyx acceleration for the CPUs and how \nthey vectorize that way I know you've \ndone a podcast with Max from mighty uh \ncan you tell me how you're thinking \nabout the vectorization layer sorry one \nmore thing is uh with weeviate I think \nkind of another interesting thing about \nthis is how we have separate Docker \ncontainers for weviate as well as these \ndeep learning model inference containers \nso you can kind of scale them up \ndifferently with I think things like the \nkubernetes helm chart and it's a little \nmore complicated about that like you can \nscale them up oh you can just use weba \ncloud service if you know as you say you \nwant to pay your bills some other way so \nuh can you tell me about how you're \nthinking about the vectorization space \nyeah for sure and I think \num so I think it's kind of like it's \nit's great when you describe how you \nguys build it uh I I take the stance \nlike of looking at it as an outsider and \nin some cases I'm basically the the \nmiddle level between you know the the \ncustomer and and then sort of \nparticipating in the decision making and \nI'm not fully aware of how things are \nimplemented inside the vector database \nfor example but I know that somebody's \ngot to pay the bill in the end right \neven if even if you use a vector sorry A \nCloud solution still the bill will come \nyour way right and guess what it's \neither you or your manager and that will \nhave to pay it and and also guess what \nuh because of the low margins and I just \nhad a podcast uh with the uh GSI product \nmanager \nuh where he says that uh uh you know a \nlot of these things are now on the \nRaiders of even big players like Amazon \nuh or any any big player that you think \nis a big player they still might have \nvery low margin like Google might have \nvery low margin on their web search \nright so it's very important for them to \noptimize things and so I think this \narticle in the budget if I can say so is \nvery important as you build the um \num the neural search experience \num and so if you need to pay like as I \nwas saying five thousand dollars uh you \nknow each time uh it's going to be \nprohibitively high and so it will slow \nyou down right like eventually you will \nsay hey maybe we don't evolve you know \nas frequently maybe we will just do it \nonce a half a year and and may also die \nout so it's kind of like important to \naddress these heads-on and in one of the \nstartups I actually recommended Marx's \nwork and so I said hey let's um \nsupport them can you port the model to \nto Onyx and basically make it available \nas part of Mighty and what Mighty does \nis that it basically moves your \ncomputation from GPU to CPU at a \ncomparable so the quality is exactly \nsame you know get the same embeddings \nbut you pay less right and the speed of \ndoing this on CPU is comparable as well \nas it would be on GPU \nso in that sense maybe you can dedicate \nGPU cluster more to things like model \nfine tuning with matters but to uh but \nto that production side of things like \nwhen you compute the embeddings already \non the existing model and then how you \nproductize how you serve things you \ndon't need gpus necessarily maybe in \nsome edge cases you do uh but then you \nknow like okay why we do this probably \nit pays the the bill and also bring \nsomething on top so it makes sense to to \ndo this right so so I think this is this \nis interesting that I've also learned in \nthe past year that \num \nyou know how things kind of get created \nright so first you get that hype of new \ntech like on a big date a few years ago \nand then comes this realization that oh \nyeah yeah we do have a lot of data oh \nsounds like Hadoop is the way to go but \nthen all this data shuffling or how do I \nupload the data into hdfs like you know \nand all these connectors arise and like \nall of these things \nand then somebody comes over and says \nhey no no Hadoop anymore like let's do \nsomething else \nso but but but I think every step in \nthis in this journey is important you \nknow if there was no hyper so to say in \nthe beginning saying like you know like \nBob uh one Lloyd was saying I was just \nin the airport of the circumference with \nGoogle and I've realized hey there is \nsomething here you know let me build \nthis model and maybe it can reason \nsemantically about text uh and even if \neven if it wasn't doing 100 perfectly it \nwas already showing the the way to move \nforward right but then all this other \nitems which are more like mundane \ninfrastructure level and sexy no one \ntalks about them on sales presentations \nso like product level maybe even right \nso you don't say this to users hey you \nknow what I spent five thousand dollars \nto embed the items and now you can find \nthem and you don't do that right it's \nusually devops people it's usually you \nknow heads of units that will say hey \ndid we spend five thousand dollars again \ncan you do something about it \num so that you go back and say how which \noptions do I have and so I think then it \nbecomes important to focus more and more \nand I think Max by the way gave an \nexcellent presentation and he showed \nalso how he scales so it's not just a \nDocker image of Mighty that you know you \ncan send a an object and get an \nembedding but he also shows how to scale \nit out and and basically still save on \non on on money and and and and make it \nefficient in terms of time time so it \nbecomes like a trade-off of how soon you \nneed it how much money you have you know \nhow much money you can burn on this and \nthings like that but basically he's is \nworking on a very efficient \nimplementation so I can recommend that \nyeah it's so interesting I think like \nyou could completely abstract it by \nsending the embeddings to the open AI \nembeddings API or coheres embeddings API \nand there's like that model as a service \nmodel on the cloud API thing or there \nare these you know do-it-yourself \noptions and I think one thing that I \nthink the Frameworks contribute a lot is \nwith the ease of like dock array embed \nor you know the Deep set cloud with \nHaystack and how you can just have your \npython code to embed and then put it in \nthe database layer so I think I'm \nskipping over a little bit over that \nlittle layer of you have the vectors and \nnow you need to import them into ev8 \nbecause I think um you know and I we we \nhave like a new python client and uh \ndirt cool wyek is the expert on this and \nhopefully he'll be back on the podcast \nhe was on our 1.15 release podcast we \ncan talk about that but uh passing that \nimport layer let's talk about \num the a n index part and I'm curious \nlike how you see the entanglement \nbetween the A and index and the database \npart like is there a chance that it \ncould be separated I don't know if we \nget like the you know hnsw product \nquantization it's written in golang it's \nvery like in the core of wevia do you \nthink these two things could be separate \nlayers of the pyramid one day yeah \nthat's also a great question uh and and \nthe podcast that I mentioned with yeah \nfrom from GSI is one example where the \nin an index can become its own entity \num because JSI is basically JSI offers a \nan APU component right so associative \nProcessing Unit so think of it as the \nsame \num you know system in in the family of \nprocessing units like CPU GPU and it's \nkind of like next uh stage in a way \ntargeted specifically at \num \nuh neural search but not only that and \nand so in principle uh vv8 or like \nquadrant or Pinecone what have you or \nelasticsearch could be basically that \ncomputation layer so in some sense it's \nlike a middle layer which receives the \ndata it knows where the data is it knows \neverything about relations between \nobjects and so on but it doesn't need to \nselect on a certain scale it could also \ndo the vector search for you right and \nso for example using quite efficient \nhnsw algorithm or uh product \nquantization or something like that \num and I know that you guys also \nimplemented dknn is that right yeah so \nlike I mean so this is when companies \nwill \nconcerned with themselves with the cost \nissue and they say hey for our use case \nit seems like you know Ram is way too \nexpensive can we actually move closer to \nthe disk and we have plenty of ssds \nthey're cheaper uh and dknn which I \nthink is kind of like a a derivative \nfrom Zoom paper essentially basically \nmoves closer to the disk it does that \nexpensive uh sorting of uh full \nPrecision vectors as the last step but \neverything uh before that happens uh on \nother layers like with lower granularity \nof vectors and they also solve the \nproblem in hnsw \num and again sorry you remarkov but like \nhe might he might he might disagree for \nsure but like uh in that paper they \nclaim in in this scan and paper they \nclaim that thousand nodes in the hnsw \ngraph that they have built were \nunreachable from any point from any \nentry point and so they have they have \nfixed this problem so they increase the \nconnectivity of the graph \nand so you know this fundamental issues \nare being solved and you can then focus \non things like okay how do I quantize my \nvectors uh to what extent and this again \nis a trade-off between \ngranularity and and sort of like later \nissues that you will have right so for \nexample with uh precision and vectors \noverlapping uh to the single point so \nyou need to disambiguate them in some \nway and there are ways to do this but \nit's also may become expensive in some \ncases \num so so this is interesting that I \nthink and this was also one of the \nquestions on my keynote as well is there \na place \nfor Hardware \ncompanies and maybe startups even to \nappear on this scene of course we know \nthat Nvidia and Intel are working on \nthis they've been competing head Zone on \nbillion scale and then competition \nchallenge last year but also of course \nGSI does it and I think yes of course \nbuilding a hardware startup today may \nsound scary but at the same time \nI think this could be very interesting \nto tap into and so maybe in the future \nalready today you know like uh there is \na connector between elasticsearch open \nsearch and GSI Hardware so basically the \nway I think about it is that in \nelasticsearch you can compute facets \nright so you can build I don't know \nnightly jobs that builds facets and then \ndisplays them in some dashboard or sends \nthem to the users \nso all of this computation could happen \nin elasticsearch but that other \nexpensive computation with neural search \nCould Happen outside so you don't need \nto kind of like suffer from the fact \nthat now you need to balance between \nthese two it's fairly expensive \nprocesses at scale \nuh but you could kind of like uh uh \ndistribute them you know how we do with \nvacuum cleaners we charge them and then \nthey go around the house and clean right \nso they don't use the electricity and \nyou can use the electricity for some \nother purpose so exactly the same idea I \nthink may may kind of like enter the \nscene uh at some point \nso immediately I thought of just so many \nthings as you're talking so packed with \nknowledge I think um well I really want \nto kind of understand the Apu a little \nmore because I don't quite understand I \nthink I think I want to quickly touch on \nsome other things and we could come back \nto that \num so I think a very interesting thing \nis about the incremental nature of the a \nn index in database entanglement the the \nkey distinction between like vector \ndatabase and Vector Library amongst \nother things in my opinion is that you \nhave to incrementally update the vector \nindex compared to like build once and \nthen you have the static index search \nand I think that's I think hnsw is \namenable to that but like product \nquantization making it like online uh \nbecause what product quantization is is \nyou have the vectors \nand you're clustering them for each of \nthe dimensions to reduce the Precision \nby representing say 32 bits with instead \nthe centroid ID of that index in the \nvector and then you can like couple it \nand slide it that way to like have the \nKings and I know that you understand \nthat I'm just kind of saying that for \nthe listeners \nbut so the kind of incremental thing is \nhow I see that distinction but um but \nyeah could we come back to the hardware \nand what makes it different I know that \nlike Sarah Bross is building this big \nchip with the thing of you know we're \nyou know like gbt3 is limited I think I \nthink 4096 is the token limit at the \ntime of this and I know it's I was \nrecently reading deepmind Sparrow paper \nand it's fascinating to see these \nmassive props like when you see a prompt \nthat's like you know a 1200 token prompt \nyou're like wow that's quite a problem \nlike this idea of building custom \nHardware to overcome the quadratic \nattention or I know there's like sparse \nattention but like generally to have \nmassive inputs to Transformers so so \nthat's kind of my frame of reference for \nunderstanding custom hardware for deep \nlearning and I think the tpus are a \nsimilar idea where it's like a big GPU \nso what are the details behind the Apu \nhow is it optimized for vectorization \nyeah that's a great question I think we \ncan share a couple links on that we've \nalso happen to build a demo which we \npresented at Berlin passwords last year \nso we took \num you know 10 million images and from \nLeon data set and we have used clip \nmodel to vectorize them and then build a \ndemo where you can compare how you know \nin image Vector search compares to let's \nsay in title Vector search versus \ncomplete keyword approach right so no \nvectors involved and so we've used Apu \nas our backend uh you know far back and \nuh for storing these vectors and \nactually uh you know Computing uh the \nnearest neighbor set and so basically \nthe way uh Apu looks all sort of like on \nthe inside is that uh first of all it's \nit's kind of like this Paradigm of \ncompute and memory so if you take kind \nof like a traditional server in a way \ntraditional um where you have a CPU on \nRAM \num when you will run the uh let's say \nhnsw algorithm or some other algorithm \nwhatever it will have to kind of like go \nback and forth between memory and CPU \nright because like some things are in \nmemory that you keep as a state but then \nin CPU you still need to do the \ncomputation right and so you you \nbasically constantly like change the uh \nthe context and so \num you kind of lose some time uh in \ndoing that uh in in the Apu they they \npushed as far ahead as possible to go \nafter uh massive computation like \nbasically \num they do it entirely in memory so they \ndon't involve \num any CPU or any other U units right so \num and and and so they have like 48 \nmillion \num Ram cells so it's highly packed maybe \nwe can provide an image you know like \none one chip that you can insert into \nthe server and I think you can insert a \ncouple of these to \nyou should insert a couple of these to \nscale to 1 billion items right and if \nyou have less you can insert maybe one \num \nand so so basically each of these units \nuh contains like 48 million \num Ram cells and then \nand then they have like so they roll \nroll up to like units that basically do \nthe programmatic bit logic computation \nand uh in principle if you \num \nif you quantize the vectors to the bit \nlevel then basically you are what you \nneed to do is kind of like bit logic \nright so like big computation like \nmultiplications or what have you \num as you do the vector search and so \nbasically like you can send \num let's say 20 queries at at one single \ntime and you might have one billion \nitems to check against and they can \nmassively basically run this parallel \ncomputation for all 20 queries at the \nsame time so you will have to \npre-compute the vector representation \nfor your vectors but beyond that they \nwill do this math massive computation \nand then they will return you results \nfor each of these query vectors and then \nyou can do whatever you want on the on \nthe front end right so for example one \nuse case could be \nyou have stored queries right and you \nwant to like see what uh new data items \nare going to be hit by these queries \nevery single day right so for example \nfor financial industry this might be \nvery important to stay on top of things \nwhat's happening do I need to sell my \nstock or buy stock or do I need to do \nnothing and so \num so this basically then becomes \nsuitable not only for similarity search \nbut also for \nimage processing itself \nso I think they're using the same units \neven in space in some cases \nbecause so if you don't have I I don't \nknow I'm getting beyond my knowledge \nhere but like if you have like this \ncomplex Hardware uh with like CPU and \nlike all these magnetic fields involved \nlike in space you might get hit by the \nradiation which like shines directly on \nthat device and so it melts or whatever \nbut like if you have less of that so you \nhave you only have memory you can seal \nit in certain way and then you don't you \ndon't need like a cooler maybe even like \nbecause you don't have the CPU itself \nbut of course you do need some cooler I \nguess or whatever so I think they're \nusing it also in space so it's kind of \nlike a versatile Tech uh but it's also \nnow purposed uh for Vector search and we \nwill like \nquite surprised I don't want to like \noversell because I don't work for JSI \nbut I had the exposure and and kind of \nlike first-hand experience \num and what surprised me is that it goes \nto like millisecond level and you have \nindexed like 10 million objects so if I \nif I was using \num let's say elasticsearch without \nscaling without sharding and indexing 10 \nmillion objects it wouldn't probably go \nwith millisecond it would probably I \ndon't know like it would probably be \nlike tenths of milliseconds or hundreds \nof milliseconds I'm guessing \num it depends on query of course uh but \nlike here I was like super super \nsurprised like it was going like I don't \nknow 10 milliseconds or something like \nwhat did it even do anything or maybe \npre-cache everything but no it did \ncompute from scratch so that was \ninteresting yeah yeah that's \nmind-blowing and that kind of frontiers \nof computation thing is so fascinating \nreminded me of this the joke we had \nwhere when we decided to name weviate \nair weviate air and Ian goes now we \ncan't build airplanes \nsending the weevier satellite \nbut yeah so I think um yeah it's really \nfascinating I think kind of coming out \nof the approximate nearest neighbor you \nknow the data structures the vector \ncompression such an interesting topic I \nfeel like this is kind of the most \ntechnical aspect of it in my view so so \ncoming up one layer then we would have \nsay how you vectorize the queries \ngenerally and you mentioned with the \ncustom Hardware how you could have some \nparticular way of batching the queries \nand you know with the offline query use \ncase but so coming up maybe one more \nlayer and this is sort of the part with \nthe neural search Frameworks or maybe \nI'm going to get myself in trouble \nbecause I think that this kind of stuff \nshould live in weviate we have well it \nalready kind of does like we have the Q \na Transformers uh Library where you can \nyou Loosely couple the vector search \nwith then passing it to the you know \nextractive question answering model we \nhave summarization and this kind of \nthing so how do you see that next level \nof the pipeline where you you have the \nresearch results and now you want to \nprocess the search results a little more \nso you you might well I guess maybe one \nother little thing I'm not a little \nthing that I missed was the in the \ncombination of vector search with \nsymbolic filters and you know as a \nminute with how that would work with the \na n index but so just as a note of for \nthe completeness of the coverage but so \nnow we have the results and we want to \nprocess them with maybe question \nanswering summarization uh and and and \nwe'll kind of if we could start from \nthere and then talk about other things \nwe could do yeah actually maybe I can \ntake a step back \num I \nuh it knew when I was working on this \nblog post about neural search Frameworks \nuh it took me several months because I \ndidn't see the picture coming together \nyet \num when I when I got the idea of \npublishing this and and just to give \nexamples Beyond Gina and um \nHaystack you also have \num managed neural Frameworks like \nVictora \nalso relevance AI \num but but and Muse but I also included \nhabia \num so and and like this is where I my \nyou know my my head was blown away like \nI was like hold on a second like so we \nmove we basically if we are looking at \nthe vector search pyramid uh as we step \nas we take a step \num you know upwards basically we are \nmoving closer to the user right so \nbecause we we don't concern ourselves \nanymore we kind of like assume that n \nand layer is solved to an extent we can \nfine tune it but it's solved Vector \nsearch database is solved because it \nexists and I can pick a variety of them \num so what what is unsolved right so why \ndo we need another layer like why can't \nI just like you know sit down and have \nall these components in my hands and \nkind of use it as a Lego building blocks \nand come up with my app in principle I \ncould right I could take vd8 I could \ntake quadrant whatever and I could then \nbuild everything and vb8 offers a lot of \nthese opportunities like um as you said \nlike for vectorization inside the \ndatabase so I don't even need to worry \nabout that part right \num and then you have these components \nfor summarization and things like that \nand things of course blend uh now that \nwe move to neural search framework \nlevel \num but it still was very logical if you \nlook at if you take a look at the blog \nyou will see each card \num you know for each of these neural \nFrameworks will have a specific field \nsaying does it use any existing Vector \ndatabase \nand if not what is being used if it's \nkind of publicly available and so if you \nlook at for example Gina \nJune is using uh vv8 quadrantelastic \nsearch and radius using as in you can \nchoose one of them right depending on \nyour setting \nHaystack kind of the same but they also \noffer an opportunity to implement \ndirectly with files and coming back to \nyour earlier Point why you need to \nchoose \na vector database over \num and an algorithm is because NN \nalgorithm might not support the symbolic \nfilters right so like if you take H and \ns w lib \num you know of the Shelf it won't \nsupport the symbolic filters right and \nthe same goes to files it doesn't \nsupport symbolic filters so it means \nthat you will have to have some external \ndatabase maybe SQL database \nwhere you will have to do this post \nprocessing step so after retrieving the \nnearest Neighbors From the somatic \nperspective nearest to your query now \nyou need to pause filter them you know \nusing the metadata filters but that can \nactually kill the whole list right so \nyou will have to either over query \nand then hope that after post filtering \nsome items will remain or you'll have to \nrepeat it several times as effectively \ndelaying the response to the user right \nso you don't want to do that so like you \nknow databases like vv8 quadrant and so \non have the support to do this in place \nright in the same stage as they said \nyeah so I think this is important right \nyeah and that that actually did change \nmy perspective a bit because I'm I could \nsee like with the with the doc array \nhaving a connection to like a graph \ndatabase separately from wevia where you \naggregate the things and then those go \ninto the re-ranking layer the question \nanswering layer and yes I can see that I \nthink but then coming back to our not \nworry about too much and just your core \nvalue if if we can offer that kind of \nlike how hybrid search is now in wevia \nand you can have the keyword search and \nthe vector search and that kind of flow \ninto your ranking thing that is very \ninteresting um so kind of one emerging \nthing with the neural search Frameworks \nand it comes back to this idea of \nlooking at different indexes a graph \ndatabase a vector index uh maybe the \nface static and maybe you have some \napplication where your data doesn't \nchange and so then the face index makes \na ton of sense so so you so there are \nthese new things called Lang chain where \nthe idea is it's uh the search framework \nis around something the the chat you I \nthink I like to say Chad gbt instead of \ngbt3 because gbt3 is impressive but at \ngbt is super impressive so maybe we \ncould call it gbt 3.5 or or four or \nwhatever but like so basically the idea \nis it's like the orchestration layer \nwhere you tell the language model uh so \nlike one way of doing it is this Chain \nof Thought prompting where uh you you \nget the few shot examples are showing \nyou how to like decompose questions such \nas to like illuminate the \ncompositionality like if you're asking \num \nuh did uh Thomas Edison use a laptop \nso you you'd want to break the question \ndown first to like okay when did Thomas \nEdison live when were laptops invented \nand then you've taken the two facts so \nit's like this layer on top that tells \nthe language model like here are the \ndifferent data sources you have access \nto uh so what do you think about that \nkind of like how how does chat gbt \ntechnology will influence uh the neural \nsearch Frameworks and then I and then \nafter that I want to get into like the \ngeneralization to images audio G like \nGene maybe like other kinds of data \ntypes but I think maybe just sticking \nwith text would be a good way to sort of \nset the stage for this yeah for sure \num and I wanted to still blend also with \num kind of like what the value prop is \nin this neural Frameworks and and maybe \nas a segue to chat GPT how Chad GPD \ncould change things so like if we take \nthe example of \num Haystack \num so for example what they allow you to \ndo is that query comes in you can have a \nnode and and the way they model this is \nthey have a dag type of thing right so \nthey have a directed The cyclic graph \nand so they the query gets classified \nlet's say with a query classifier that's \none node and then after this query is \nclassified it can depending on the class \nthat is predicted it can either go to \ndense retriever or it can go to a \nkeyword retriever right let's say maybe \nit's based on length or some other \nfeatures that you know work so you you \nhave a boundary in your classifier and \nand then but maybe in some cases even it \ncould go to both of these \nand then you will have a further node \nthat will read the results from this \nretrievers and will merge them and then \npresent them in some way uh using I \ndon't know RF method or some reciprocal \nrank Fusion or some other method so and \nyou can like play with this you can you \nhave you can have like different nodes \ndo different things like \num OneNote could be if you classified \nthe query as a question you could do a \nquestion answering but if it was like a \ntable uh related like SQL table so you \nclassified it as a SQL \ncompatible query so you could go to that \nnode and say hey can you also query the \ntable \num you can also do like document \nsimilarities new documents come in so it \ndoesn't need always to be \nthat doesn't always need to be like on \nthe retriever side it could be as part \nof your backend pipeline uh somewhere \nwhere you need to do document similarity \nand then decide whether or not to even \ncompute an embedding for this document \nmaybe it didn't change or maybe it \ndidn't change enough to Warrant a new \nembedding and so you might discard it \nand so on but you also have these other \nnotes which we talked about earlier \nabout document extraction process so you \nextract things and you know proceed to \nto the embedding layer coming back to \nyour question about chat GPT \num I I had an exposure to it of course I \nI actually uh well asked it can you name \nmy blog post because I was still stuck \nthere and and I grounded it and I said \nhey I wrote another blog post about \nVector databases and this is how it was \ncalled not all Vector databases that may \ntake well maybe you can play on those \nwords or something but it decided not to \nuse the same sort of words and just gave \nme neural search Frameworks I had to had \ncomparison I was like oh boom cool \nlike you cannot imagine like you can do \nthe work and then it leads up to the \nposting and you're like how should I \nname it when you go to your friends your \nwife and they'll how should I name my \nblog post like how do I know \nso in this like really strange \nsituations you can reach out to \nsystems like chat dpd like if I went on \nuh tactical or being a Google or \nsomething and I asked the same question \nI probably wouldn't get an answer I \nwould get a bunch of links and like what \nshould I do with these things like \nso this is this distracts me more than \nit gives me value but in chat GPD I got \nan instant answer and I was like I like \nit I spent maybe five minutes thinking \nabout it and I liked it and I slapped it \non the on the title that was fine so \nso I think in some sense maybe to me \nthis wasn't even a search experience uh \nin this kind of basic definition or sort \nof uh the way we used to it uh \ndefinition that okay I I need to type \nsomething and then I need to examine \nlinks or examine some output go check \nthe results and then decide myself like \nam I satisfied or not uh in chat Deputy \nyou don't have any URLs coming back to \nyou not yet at least maybe they will be \nadded who knows but like today it's more \nlike a companion that you can talk to \nand in some sense I was dreaming of such \na companion maybe you know when you \nstudy \nyou have all these books and papers and \neverything but can you really quickly \nmake sense of oh can you can you like \nfind an answer to that specific you know \nnagging question like you you had during \nthe lecture uh it's super hard right so \nyou of course you can go to search \nengine and start typing all these \nqueries but here you can have like um \nkind of like a sensible discussion in a \nway of course I know some people uh even \nlike hysterically are laughing at the \nresults and so on and so forth so maybe \nit's not uh purposed for all situations \nand also for all audiences it was \nactually a discovery for me uh there was \none linguist uh that I was following \nhe said that \num he cannot use General web search \nengines because every time he types \nsomething they don't understand what he \nthey don't have the data it's not it's \nnot even about understanding they don't \nhave the data and so he needs to go to \nlibraries and like read books that are \nnot indexed in this search engines and \nthings like that so for this very \nspecific Niche use cases Maybe \nuh chat GPT might not work it depends on \nthe data again \num but I think it was surprisingly \nclever right if I can say so about AI \num \nuh it wasn't \nalways static and you you explained it \nwell that it takes different paths in \nthe tree when it computes the answer \num and and the other question I asked \nlike can you find a bug in this code \nthat I wrote and it just licks memory at \nsome point and it gave some sensible \nsuggestions and and I felt like I know \nthat it's kind of like a silicon there \nbut like I cannot maybe like yeah \num like I I still need to examine some \ncaution and sort of not fully trust \num maybe for Life sensitive situations \nor something like that you know or \nmedicine or insurance or something like \nthat but like things that I know it has \nindexed and and and humans have written \nthat \nyou know and and and and it has been \nsort of vetted multiple times and so \nalso uploaded a bunch of times on stack \nOverflow if you were talking about \ncoding and so there are some there is \nsome evidence that this might be the \nanswer but but I think it was still \nsurprising that how it changes the \nperception of search even if we can talk \nabout search in this case \nthat it it actually generates the answer \nyou know search engines don't generate \nanswers today like Beyond maybe okay \nyou.com and Google the youtube.com I \nthink is more advanced in this but like \nGoogle has this Snippets you know where \nit says you know probably the answer is \nthis \num and so they commingle it with URLs uh \nbut like in charge GPD you don't have \nany URLs it just talks to you and then \nyou can continue the discussion I don't \nknow it was fascinating but I still \ndon't know if \nif this will make it into the \nnecessarily search experience like so in \nsearch I I think it's very functional \nyou know if I walk down the street and I \nsee something on uh like on the shop \nwindow I take a picture and I say I want \nthis \num and so it finds by the image \num so that that is still a search \nexperience for me so in some sense maybe \nin the future you know we will have \ncontrol F on everything in the world \nright so like as I walk everywhere \num I can kind of mentally press that \nCtrl F maybe in some device maybe on top \nof me or like a glasses or something I \ndon't know uh VR \nuh but like today a lot of places miss \nthis and and still there are a lot of \ncontexts and situations when you ask \nyourself what is this do I know this you \nknow and you have some other like uh \nsubsequent questions but there is no way \nto \nask them because you don't like you can \npull up the phone and start typing and \nit's freezing weather and you're like oh \nmy God \nit's like not it's kind of like a \ndeteriorating experience but I think it \ncould be so much more \num \ninteractive and multi-modal and I think \nneural search especially \nenables multimodality situations right \nand experiences so that you can actually \nlike not constrain yourself to to the \npoint that am I uh asking like a textual \nquery or I just have a query I have \nsomething on my mind right or maybe I \nsaw something can you tell me more about \nit \num so I think I think maybe chat GPT \nmight push us in that direction that not \nonly it will find things but it will \nalso reason about things and help you \nreason but but the creativity part \nI don't think it will it will disappear \nI I don't think at least not now I don't \nI don't see how AI can solve creativity \npart like create things for you yeah it \ndid create the title \num you know but but maybe a more \ncreative person than me could actually \ncreate a better title right and things \nlike that so yeah \nit yeah there's a lot that I want to \nunpack and I I do think this the \ncreativity is kind of like a \ncharacteristic of compositional \ngeneralization and novel I suppose but I \nI want to just kind of tell you about \none other idea that relates to how you \nhad chat gbt uh come up with the title \nfor your blog post and so I want to \ncredit uh Bob Van light and Jerry Liu \nthe creator of gbt index they included \nme on this call where uh they were you \nknow hashing out their understanding of \nthe gbt index top level indexing and I \njust think this idea is so profound on \nhow we use chat gbt and it's the idea of \nwhen we search and we get like 15 \nresults as you mentioned we need to like \nparse through the result and so like one \nthinking was like how about we use a \nCrossing like a high capacity cross \nencoder which is like going to be \nanother like let's say it'd be like \nmaybe like an 80 million parameter \nTransformer they there are papers where \nthey use like big T5 models like billion \nparameter T5 models to re Rank and \nthere's like this paper where you have \nthe density on yes or like query and \nthen you put the query document document \nand then yes no and you re-rank with \nthat and you use high capacity models \nsimilar log prop that kind of idea but \nso this idea of like how do we parse \nthrough a bunch of results and then \nanother idea was like okay well maybe we \nuse a question answering model and we'll \nre-rank it based on the confidence of \nthe extractive question answering model \nand we'll try to calibrate the question \nnow answering models to to demonstrate \nuncertainty maybe Bayesian networks \nsomething like that but this new idea of \nhaving gbt summarize the results by \nhaving the original question and then \nsaying please summarize these results \nyou'll receive it one by one and then it \nreceives it one by one updates a summary \nmaybe as you mentioned like you would \nwant to have the reference it could \nmaybe say like oh and also please like \nyou know keep a cue of the most \ninfluential uh results as you've been \nparsing through it and it's like ability \nto reason and do this I've been playing \naround with this a little bit I think is \njust super profound and that so that \nkind of summarization across results \nwhat do you think of that idea because I \njust am mind blown by it yeah this is \namazing \num I'm not as deep in this topic yet but \nI just understand surface of it \nlistening to what you just explained you \nknow there is still this trust component \nas well that and again this trust is \njust how we perceive it it was designed \nthat way and we think this is the \ntrustworthy way to uh that the \ninformation that I'm getting so if I get \nthe URL from the search engine I can \nclick and then see it with my own eyes \nand see when it was published by whom \nand maybe I can even reach out to that \nperson and ask some questions \num so if I have not provided with this \ninformation and evidence how do I know \nthat this is true right so um or maybe \ndoes it even apply to my specific \nsituation uh maybe it gave me way too \ngeneric answer and so I think \num \nit would be interesting to see if if I \nhave a list of people that I follow on \nTwitter let's say and I trust them on \nspecific topic you know let's say the \nway I trust how you Corner publish you \nknow thinks about specific papers or \nsome breakthroughs and recent \nimplementation in Vector search space \num so when I have a specific question \nmaybe I could say hey let me first check \nwhat corner thinks about this right so \nif chat GPT could kind of like bias the \nanswer and include some of the hints \nfrom you \nfrom your timeline not not from your \ntimeline but from the things that you \npublished on Twitter \num on that specific topic \num and then include that as a \nsupplementary material or maybe like a \nchapter sort of you know I mean the \nanswer so I can \nI don't need to \num you know go and check Twitter now I I \ncan actually go directly to the \ninformation right \num and I can read it \num and then if I have a question maybe \nif I reach out to you I might ask a very \nspecific question rather than \nsaying saying like can you point me to a \npaper you know \num in this topic so \nso I think \nI think \num maybe Chad DPT made that first \nimportant step \nit created also a lot of like \nmaybe controversy or some people uh I \nremember like one case on on stacker um \non uh Hacker News was uh so this guy is \nparking his car in in wrong I guess in \nthe wrong lot so like in the wrong spot \nin the in the parking lot and then he \ngets a fine uh and then he's like out of \noptions and he's thinking okay what if \nChad GPT can help me here and so he \nasked Chen TPT to write an email to this \nofficial uh you know saying oh yeah I \nput on my app and I paid for it but \napparently I I put my car in the wrong \num you know slot and a spot and so and \nso it was like like it's you know like \nhow in certain cases certain situations \nlike we when we zoom in on a situation \nand we're a little bit like stressed we \nlose words and phrases \nand that's probably why psychologists \nand Consultants exist because you run \ntowards them and you say hey I have a \nproblem \ncalm down you know what happened that \nthey will help you to walk through the \nsituation and then they will say say \nlike this you know dear official \nwhatever I happen to park my car in the \nwrong spot I understand this is a big \nmistake uh however I paid for it in my \napp here is the receipt do you think and \nthen \nit's like the computers they don't \num I think this is also a good thing \nlike to some people it's bad thing and \nit can be \num I guess developed towards that they \ndon't feel that I have a lot of emotions \nright they may pretend to have emotions \nlike in ex machina movie right but like \nbut I think \num \nthey are very calm and like okay your \nproblem is this you know like Sheldon \nCooper okay here is the answer and and \nsometimes it may help you and actually \nin that case the official came back and \nsaid yeah I understood the situation \nhappens sometimes you know I will just \nissue a warning this time you don't need \nto pay fine and you are good don't do it \nnext time that's fine right so probably \nI got carried away a bit but but I think \nbut I think that coming back to your \nquestion like if I can \nif I know that there is a very \ninteresting \nbook or blog post \nand it's in my browser history it's \naccessible and I can give access to it \nuh to chat GPT it can go and personalize \nto my interest however biased it is I \ndon't care maybe I do want to be biased \nI don't want a random \nblog post published somewhere well you \ncan add it if you want but still can you \nbias to what I have read and I have \nalready forgotten you know in several \ndecades that I leave I've forgotten they \nread the book can you remind me of that \nuh snow yeah I think there is a way to \ntake chat GPT to the next level in in \nterms of personalizing the answers \nyeah and I think well personalizing the \nanswers I think it comes well coming to \nour other podcast where we talked about \nref to VEC and the personalization \nvector and how that can filter the \nsearch results and then those are the \nresults that go into chat gbc's context \nbut I think the other thing you're \nsaying one I think like this prompting \nis so interesting like one thing I've \nplayed with is write a write an argument \nbetween Ilya sutzka CEO of or I don't \nknow what his job title is it open AI \nbut I write an argument between Ilya \nsatsgiver and Clement de lang from \nhugging face about closed versus open \nsource models right like you prompted \nlike that you give it like a background \nabout each of them and the argument and \nI think also what you say about polite \nwriting like one of my favorite ways to \nuse chat gbt is I'm writing something I \ngive it a sentence and I say could you \nsuggest seven writings of this and it's \nfunny you mentioned that it's just \nsilicon because sometimes I'm like I'm \nlike oh seven that's kind of a tall task \nmaybe just three \nI think that kind of comes into also \nlike when it's no longer free it might \nchange how we use it a little bit too \nlike like the way I use the GPS 23 API \nI'm like well I'm paying for the tokens \ngenerated so let me not prompted to give \nsome long generation but so I think this \nhas been a great coverage of Chad gbt \nand continuing on the pyramid I kind of \nwant to hit what I see at the top level \nwhich is just the user interface like \nthe you know like someone with CSS \nskills how they contribute and how they \nfit into this and I've I've seen uh like \nGina now uh you know I know we have some \nstuff that's not out yet but like on \nthis kind of the search interface and I \nknow like usually you know you just have \nlike a search box right like it's just \nthe bar is like kind of the interface \nbut say you're doing like image search \nand you want to like click on the images \nyou want to fuse that with the search \nbox and I don't know do you see like a \nlot of in I know like you.com \nand it kind of comes into what you're \nsaying with how you have the evidence as \nwell like you.com they have this \ninterface where they split the search \nresults and then the chat gbt like this \ninterface do you think there's \nopportunity for Innovation at that layer \nyeah uh I think one one part is \ninnovation and another thing that I've \nbeen thinking about is let's say there \nis a existing player and they have a \nsearch engine let's recommend \nrecommender system or something and \nthey're thinking okay can we \nexperiment with Vector search but we are \nprobably not like hundred percent sure \nyet is it going to fly or you know can \nwe expose it only to sort of like the \npower users in some sense uh I think \ngenome had this kind of like um early \nstage Demos in some sense early stages \nin maybe you don't go with this in into \nproduction but it helps you to reason \nabout \num and and test \num what's more important I think \num the influence of neural search on \nyour \num you know search engine experience so \nthey had um I think they had this search \nengine where like a demo where you type \na query \num and then you have this slider I guess \nso you can say \nyou know have more weight put more \nweight on keyword results and then you \nslowly blend this into the neural search \nand then and then you can choose like \nokay it's going to search directly in \nthe images let's say using clip model \num but still combine the results so \nstill ask the keyword Retriever and then \ncombine the results from the dance \nretriever from the clip model and sort \nof like show me where these results land \nright so if because for some queries it \ndoesn't make sense to check the image \nbecause \nit's succinct enough \nand it looks like it's going to match a \nspecific metadata you know item filter \nor maybe title of that object so there \nis no reason really to go and examine \nthe image because it doesn't contain \nthis information and vice versa 2 like \nin some cases when I say \nI don't know like can you give me a \npicture of a bear eating a fish in the \nbeaver you know and there is no such \nstyle because you do have an image of a \nvaries in the fish in the river and \nyou're like yeah maybe if the model and \nwe have done this in the clip search \nengine \ndemo that essentially \nit it surprises you blows your mind that \nthe clip model can \num summarize its understanding so to say \nto this level that it will match \nanything you type like that so you say a \nbear and it understands what the bear is \nit's not an author and things like that \nright so this is very interesting of \ncourse it goes back to you know \ncontrastive learning and people have \nenough negative examples which are \nsemantically negative and not just \nrandom negative examples and things like \nthat but they also uh came across I \nwonder if I can pull it up \num \nbut when I published this blog post \nabout neural \num search \nFrameworks \num \nuh I came across uh this company called \nNuclear So I didn't didn't yet include \nthem in the blog post I need to study \nthis a little more but there was some \ninteresting thing that they offer \num a way to compose the UI as well right \nso it's not only this is coming back to \nyour question you know can we uh sort of \nmake some break breaks throughs there of \ncourse if it's an established player \nthey have the dedicated front-end team \nthey will probably figure out what they \nwant to do and they have an existing \nproduct but if you are on the verge of \nexperimenting right so you're still \nthere you you have your your like mind \nopen \nin many ways you you don't know what UI \nwill be in the end they offer Beyond you \nknow \num a database font structured data they \nalso offer you a number of components on \nthe front-end side so you can basically \ncompose the UI the way you want \num and I think like you.com I think you \nmentioned also experiments with chat GPT \nlike answers right so not only the URLs \nbut also kind of like an answer which is \nmore interactive and maybe you can \ncontinue the discussion there in that \nbox \num I also want to like give an example \nwhich which was like pre-neural search \nera in many ways at Alpha sense like \nlike when I look at document search \nengines you know let's say it's an \narticle search engine or patent search \nengine uh usually you will have like um \nseveral stages as you go through the UI \nas a workflow so first you need to type \nthe query then the screen changes to the \nlist of documents sorted in some way \nthen you click on the document again the \nscreen changes and it opens the document \nright what alphasense did really really \nearly on like \n2010 \nwas to have what we called a three pane \nUI so you have like you have a search \nbox box at the top \nuh you type the query press enter you \nget a vertical uh \ncolumn you know a column with the \nresults \nnot too narrow you can still figure out \nwhat is what you can read titles \nyou click on that it gets the snippet \npane so you can actually quickly gather \nokay is this relevant to me or not so \nyou have like several stages but it's \nall on the same screen almost like an \nAmazon checkout page right kind of and \nthen as you click on the snippet it \npulls up the document however big it is \nmaybe let's say PDF document thousand \nPages it will load only the necessary \nchunk of that document and it will jump \nfrom that clicked snippet to the \nrelevant section of the document so now \nyou basically have all these you know \ntools in the same view and I think \nthis is very powerful because \nit saves a ton of time you know because \nyou you need to always kind of walk the \nin the shoes of the user what does the \nuser want to achieve with your not with \nyour product they hire your product uh \nto get some job done right and so is \nyour UI efficient enough uh in in in uh \nyou know in satisfying that specific uh \nrequest and so so I think this was very \ninteresting and then some competitors \ntried not only tried but copied you know \nthis this View and and then the history \ngoes on but but but I think this was a \nvery interesting breakthrough even like \nbefore uh neural search but with neural \nsearch \na lot more doors open because \nand also it brings \nthat complexity layer that now product \nmanagers engineers \ngotta simplify so like you need to \nsimplify the complex always \nbecause users will not have time \nto figure out really complicated \ndesigns or uis however flashy flashy \nyour UI is if it's not functional \nit's going it's not going to fly so you \nneed to kind of like simplify the \ncomplex and now these open doors with \nmulti-modality right so like all of a \nsudden your query can go directly into \ninside the image now it pulls up the \nimage you need to explain to the you you \ncannot highlight like a snippet inside \nthe image right and say hey there is an \narrow here that's the bear you will you \nare asking for \nso like inside the patent like in patent \nsearch \nI spent some time uh I was part of the \nboard in one big Enterprise basically \nexamining the patent to be the patent \napplications and a big chunk of work for \na patent presenter would go into \nexamining the prior art and so they need \nto examine a ton of patents and figure \nout whether or not they overlap with \nthat specific button or not right and so \nthis means that \nthe search \nthe search workflow changes from get me \nsomething on the screen and I'll decide \nif it's good enough to can you give me \neverything there is on this topic so \nit's like a long long search you \npaginate like how until like 200 page \n200 or something and you gotta have like \n100 results on the per page or something \nlike that so they spend like days \nexamining just one query and then you \ncould go back and say oh my query is \nmissing this term you know let me change \nmy query boom I have again the new list \nof results and now it would be cool if \nthe system \nshowed me the difference right and this \nwas another feature we had at Alpha \nsense you know as new documents come in \nlet's say you have a \nuh let's say if it's a public company \nand they publish uh a 10K report which \nis like a yearly SEC filing \num it might include portions of a \nquarterly report from a quarter prior \nand so and also like that 10K which was \npublished a year ago they don't actually \nrewrite it they just change some numbers \nright you know like performance our Top \nLine whatever so like you don't want to \nreread 700 Pages again to learn has \nsomething change with this guy you just \nwant to see oh the Top Line changed and \nalso \nyou know they spend a lot more on \nproduction of that sort and like okay \nnow I need to go back to my Excel and \ninput these numbers and see what happens \nto the stock price prediction right so I \nmean always think I don't know if I \nanswer your question well enough but \nlike always like forget about Vector \nsearch forget about learning to rank you \nknow however sexy those are and those \nare super cool I mean I'm excited myself \nalways go back to what user wants right \nlike if they're driving to that \ndestination as we compute in TomTom \nalways remember I'm sitting in the car \nit's freezing it's dark I want to get \nthere \nso so show me that top result as soon as \npossible \nso I don't need to type that long you \nknow uh sitting in that freezing bed or \nwhatever so so it's not I think it's a \ngood exercise to always kind of go back \nand maybe talk to the users as well \num in some cases it's Mom \nuh maybe complex but I think still that \npipeline could be established and you \ncan start asking questions okay \nwhat are you trying to find what is your \nnormal sort of workflow and use case \nwhat are you trying to optimize for \nand they will give you very interesting \nsometimes confusing answers maybe so you \ncan drill in and find a sort of a more \ndetailed version of what they wanted to \nsay \num but then it comes to it rolls up to \nthis bigger picture ah I got it uh we \nare just missing one button here \nsomething like that and then \nyeah yeah \num Barbara taught me about this jobs to \nbe done framework for thinking about \nthis and and I think at the use and the \njobs to be done it's like this business \nschool thing about like why did you hire \nthe donut to do the job of uh something \nto eat on the way to work I think the \nuser interface layer you think the most \nabout the job being done so I think that \nwas a great and yeah the job to be done \nhas cascading effects to the whole \npyramid and the different requirements \nall the way down I think this is a great \nuh summary of the pyramid and then a \ntransition into a really fun topic to \nwrap up with which is um this idea of \nrenaming Vector search to maybe \nrelevance application yeah \nyeah no I actually wanted to pick your \nbrain on that because I know you the \nmoment I posted uh that podcast \nand if you have uh responded and that \nwas like a long answer and I was like oh \nI got Connor and he's like really \npassionate about this topic I think this \nis important like I I will I will tell \nthis disclaimer \nit's not my idea but \nI like to throw in some thoughts which \nare of higher level \num and maybe the goal is to not change \nthe course of the industry but more like \nin form and give another perspective and \nI think this perspective came from Doug \nTurnbull on on one of the episodes in \none of the episodes of vector podcast \nwhere he said if I was to give an advice \ntoday to the vector search engines to \nthe vector databases I would say stop \ncalling yourself a vector database and \nit was like a cold shower already like \nstop calling yourself a vector database \nand call ourselves what and why \nbut he spent a lot of time in search \nright he wrote the book relevant search \nas well corroded \num and he's uh co-writing AI powered \nsearch as well and so \nhe said well think about \nthe nutshell of what you're building \nright it's like what \num new area you are discovering right on \none hand we are all building or \nparticipating in the construction sort \nof like rise of new industry but in the \nend of the day it either solves or \ndoesn't solve some use case or plethora \nof use cases right so we claim that \nwe are moving to semantic search level \nright something that didn't happen \nbefore something that was hard to \nachieve and \nyou know maybe with custom synonyms uh \nsynonym tables or with bootstrapping \nanother Shard to handle that language \nnow we have multilingual models so they \nhandle \nmultiple languages and the same \nrepresentation and so it's the same \nshared geometric space which is kind of \nlike super cool like enhance I can ask \nmy \nmy question in one language and get it \nsearched in another language then you \nstill need to deal with the answers like \ndo I need to translate them back to the \nsource language or something but that's \nanother story \num \nand so so he claimed or he kind of like \nsuggested that \nin a way we are \nsolving towards uh relevancy and so he \nsaid why don't you call yourself a \nrelevance oriented application and he \nwasn't \nstubborn on that specific term or like \nthat specific phrase but I guess the key \nword for me that stood out its relevance \nright because \nand then I I also weared my hat of a \nproduct manager and thought okay if I go \nto my boss at Tom Tom and I say hey \nlet's \num bring this semantics into the mix and \nguess what we need a back to database so \nlet's let's acquire back today based \nlicense or something I think the first \nquestion would be what the heck is a \nvector database it's like vector clocks \nI used to have some quarries or \nsomething no I'm just I'm just I'm just \njoking here but I'm saying that you know \nor like \nit becomes like this kind of uh \nuh engineering uh lingo \num or like they say Greek right so speak \nEnglish \nI don't understand you and so then you \nsay oh you know Vector databases it's \nlike a new breed of databases \num it's like the next stage Sequel and \nit's like sequel wait a sec let's just \nforget all this it's it's \num it's basically like moving everything \nusing deep learning moving everything to \ndeep learning okay uh hold on \num so semantics you get the word \nsemantics right so like we move to \nsemantic uh level searching and um by \nthe way we can ask natural language \nquestions now oh natural language \nquestions what is that so it's like well \njust just normal questions instead of \ntyping keywords you can basically you \nsee what I'm doing I'm basically like \nstepping back and back and back and I'm \nkind of like degrading the terminology \nfrom \noh this is like a super cool aircraft uh \nyou know and I've used all these \nmaterials to build it all these glowing \nbuttons like what can it do it can fly \nyou to Mars Mars I don't I don't want to \ngo too much \nthis is what I'm saying like like step \nback as far as possible back and say \nyou know remember we have this problem \nin in in TomTom sometimes people ask \nquestions so they say can you drive me \nto a lake or something so it's like they \ndon't type like an address because they \ndon't know the address of the lake like \ndoesn't have an address maybe it has the \ncoordinates and so we have certain \npercent of these queries and maybe we \ncan tackle them with this new tag then \nyou can maybe say Vector databases are \nthe new breed of databases but like \nyeah I guess when you when you enter a \ndiscussion with \non a prepared customer \nuh you might not start maybe it's not a \ngood idea to start with Vector databases \nsome technical term instead \nyou know \ntalk about semantics or relevance or \nsomething like of that sort \nyeah let me see if I can do uh can you \ndrive me to the lake \nI think maybe let's see if that example \ncan show the different intents that that \ncould entail so so maybe you would want \nit to be asking it like are you capable \nof this task and it would say like yes I \ncould show you how to drive to the lake \nmaybe maybe it would find another \nquestion where someone else had asked \nsomething like that or you know what you \nwant probably is like the Google Maps \ndirections current location to the \nnearest lake \nlike so I've been seeing this like \nintent ranking papers like task aware \nretrieval with instructions and the \ninstructor model where uh yeah like \nthere's different intents for different \nsearch tasks like so with core I \nduplicate question detection like the \nacademic data set you're looking for \nanother question not the answer to the \nquestion and and so it's I don't know \ntoo many k like it's kind of like the \nidea where you encode The Domain in the \ntask like you say search me a paragraph \nin scientific literature compared to \nin Reddit like it could have like find \nme a you could say like find me a \nconversation on Reddit which is a \ndifferent intent than um find me the \nanswer from Wikipedia is this helping \nwhen I'm like this kind of so I don't \nso that's kind of how I'm thinking about \nit I mean I still think \nI I still think the vector search \ndatabase I like that so much because it \nkind of comes all the way back to the \npyramid where it's like this coupling of \nthe a n and then the database stuff and \njust maybe it's particularly how it's \ndone in weeviate but that those two are \nso tightly coupled sort of I see it as \nthat that's sort of like what I see as \nthe novelty but yeah it's really \nfascinating I think relevance podcasts \nwelcome to season three of the welcome \nuh relevance podcast yeah \nactually I was I was I was surprised or \nmaybe \num it confirms the bias in a way that \nwhen I was writing this blog post about \nneural search Frameworks one of the \nplayers is called relevance Ai \nand when I was talking to Daniel vasilev \nwho is the CEO of this company and \nco-founder \num he was advising me to even stop using \nthe word vector and embedding and I was \nlike what do you mean and he was saying \nwell you know our user base \nand our Target user base is not \nnecessarily Engineers it's not \nnecessarily deep learning researchers \nit's um \nanybody it's uh someone working in HR \nand they have a bunch of CVS and I guess \nthey want to like take a look at them \nfrom a different angle quickly find a \ncandidate \nmaybe plot some characteristics you know \nquickly cluster them things like that \nand so and so they don't \num they don't uh you know so the \nprogression of thought is not like this \nI have a bunch of CVS \nand then based on the embeddings I will \ncompute the Clusters and then I will run \nVector search no they don't even know \nwhat these things are they go on \nrelevance AI platform \nthey upload \nCV so they point to some archival like \nCloud URL and then the system pulls them \ndown and basically extracts all of these \nthings that we described in this in this \nepisode you know the workflows it does \nit behind the scenes so you don't need \nto worry about it and then it embeds the \nuh the documents and then it basically \ngives you the search prompt so you can \nsearch them right so so they they target \nI guess a completely different \num user base right so like if you if you \nif you contrast that for example what \nHaystack is doing \nand I was also talking with Malta a lot \nas I was prepping the blog post \num he was saying that this is kind of \nlike a development kind of like an IDE \nin a way right so like um deep set cloud \nis kind of like an ID for integrated \ndevelopment environment for \num an engineer or researcher or maybe \nboth of them collaborating and they can \neven chat so you can find references of \nthe discussion that happened earlier and \nlike go through that and things like \nthat and make decisions together and \nthen plot metrics so it's a different \nit's a different like user base right \nlike \nthe target user ideal user is somebody \nwho \nlike understands coding and \nunderstands the concerns of scaling and \ncost management and whatnot and so they \nare much closer to the actual uh \nplatform creation right \nso but like if you took like someone \nreached out recently to me on LinkedIn \nuh in product management capacity and \nthey said yeah we know that you \npublished all of this but can you give \nus like a couple blog posts \num or maybe a podcast which introduces \nus to this space so I I don't think I \nwill send them like Haystack \nURL right like because it will be way \ntoo technical for them and and hashtag \nhas like excellent documentation but \nit's purposed to \nengineers and researchers in a way right \nand then of course there is and and \nthere is a product for every of these \num \nchoice or sort of business model right \nso like a product to be created so for \nin in the case of haystack they have \ndeep set Cloud so you can basically \nsubscribe pay for it and don't need to \nhost and like worry about how I scale if \nsomething breaks whatever right same \nwith vb8 you know you guys have a cloud \nas well and things like that \num \nso so I guess to wrap up this thought is \nthat it kind of like depends on \nwhat your ideal Target user is right \num and also \nwhat \num \nuse cases you have uh tested your Tech \nwith you know that \nanother use case like this we know how \nto how to work through it and so that's \nwhy in each card in the blog post you \nwill also find use cases \num list right and and I tried to \nFocus not on if I could not only on sort \nof tech level or kind of like algorithm \nlevel thing but actually specifically on \nthe end user facing use case for example \nin the case of haystack they have you \nknow document information extraction but \nthey also have \num \nyou know getting Revenue numbers from a \nfinancial report this sounds more like a \nspecific use case now right or like \nreason for a legal claim \nso it's not it's not it's not like um \nokay I have this neural network \nhow do I plug in that into quadrant of \nV8 Pinecone right \num \nis there a plug-in architecture that I \ncan Implement you know what I mean like \nso it's it's a different level of \nabstraction and it's a different level \nof discussion as well and so so I think \nwhen Doug \nI believe \nkind of like deciphering his thought \nprocess was to kind of stop talking only \nmaybe only about tech \nand and by the way I love Vector \ndatabase myself that term \nmy podcast is Vector podcast many people \nthink it's about Vector search but it's \nnot only Vector search it's it's like I \nin the in the about uh on YouTube I \nactually write that it's like a vector \nas in what Vector you have in your \nprofession and life in a way \nbut many people come back and say \nit's metric on the creator of vector \nsearch podcast \num it's not Vector search but it's just \nVector podcast but but but that's okay \nyeah \nVector podcast very cool so I guess to \nwrap up again uh really close on often \nthis that \num \nso first of all a it's it's about the \nniche it's it's the not the niche but \nthe sort of your ideal user that you're \ngoing after at B \nthink about are you limiting yourself \nunnecessarily \nin the way of sort of \nhow many users what type of user you \ncould reach with your \num with your system with your engine \nbecause you said for example bb8 code in \nprinciple eat away some functionality \nfrom neural search Frameworks so it kind \nof like begins to occupy these two \nlayers and this Vector search pyramid \nright \num or Bland them and that's why and \nthat's fine but like is it is it \nlimiting to limiting to say that it's \nonly a database and it's only a vector \ndatabase maybe it's more than that right \nso that's just a couple thoughts there \nyeah it's really enlightening and I want \nto give credit to Sebastian Whitlock and \nthe devrel team at weviate that's \nhelping me think like this like um I \nguess like me personally I have a \nbackground in like doing academic \nresearch in the PHD and you know reading \nmachine learning papers and thinking \nvery along the lines of like vector \nsearch database makes a ton of sense \nright well like um like I think one \nexample is um Erica Cardenas on the weba \nteam also she created a like a dog image \nsearch demo and so it's like there could \nthere are like layers to how you want to \npresent this you could it could be like \njust point us to a folder with images in \nit right that was like the the most \nsimple thing to do or it could be like \nokay well we're gonna actually encode \nthis into a base64 encoding we're gonna \nuse a resnet we're going to use the \nrezna 18 is you know probably don't need \nthe 32. \nso it's like how much detail do you want \nto cover and I think it's super \ninteresting and and like by \ncommunicating dating that way you'll \nunlock the like creativity of the people \nwho are thinking it at the higher \napplication layer and you know paying \nthe bills the other way is good because \nI wonder how many times we've said that \nphrase in the hour and a half \nyeah yes it's like decision makers right \nsometimes you \nsometimes it actually is going the \nopposite way it's like \num \nyou may spare some time as an engineer \nor researcher \nuh test some algorithm show results \nimpress yourself impress your colleagues \nand then this rumor will travel \nto the level of product management \ndecision making above product management \nas well and they will say wow this is \nsuper cool \ncan we release this to prod now right \num does it happen frequently I don't \nknow it depends on the company I guess \nit depends on the culture and I guess we \ncould also spend some time talking at \nsome point you know how companies are \nstructured and how you have this I think \nit's Conway law right so that \num \nyour product is a result of how you have \nuh organized people in the company \nbecause they will have like teams silos \nmaybe at some point even and some teams \nmight not be talking to each other as \nmuch as you think they could and so your \nproduct will be a product architecture \nwill be a result of this information \narchitecture which is also very \ninteresting \num but for startups it's probably not \nthe problem for startups you can talk to \nanybody anytime \nright but you still need to get job done \nso that's that's also another \nperspective \num \nso yeah I mean this is very interesting \ntopic and in general \num \na lot of angles to take and if you \nalways like remember whom are you \ntalking to and and just to wrap up on \nthe thought like if the if the \nBreakthrough doesn't happen from the \nengineering level \ncan it happen let's say and product \nmanagement level \nbecause you have resonated with how they \nthink and you know what type of issues \nthey're trying to solve \nand you have stepped back from the \ntechnical terminology and you started \ntalking the lingo and they said here is \nwhat Vector search actually is \nthen they will \ngo back to the the drawing board and say \nah this is what it enables us to do and \nnow we can search inside the images wow \nyeah \nyeah well amazing I think this was an \namazing podcast beginning from talking \nabout the opportunity cost of bad search \nin retail and then digging it into okay \nso you're building a neural search \nframework there's all these components \nto it your famous pyramid diagram and \nwalking through every step in detail \nthen coming to thoughts on chat gbt \nyeah and I think just the user interface \nthe job is to be done this whole thing \nand the renaming of vector search has \nbeen such an incredible podcast uh \nDimitri thank you so much for your time \ncoming on the weba podcast and thanks \nalso so much for hosting me on the \nvector podcast I'm such a fan of the \nvector podcast and what you're doing \nit's so it's so interesting to hear all \nthe different characters and I think \nsort of the role you're playing and \nbeing like the mediator of the market \nthis way and hearing all the diverse \nvoices hopefully I didn't give up too \nmuch of what we're thinking but \nthis kind of diversity of hearing what \neveryone's thinking it's just so \nfascinating and thank you so much \nthank you so much Connor for hosting uh \nthe end this was amazing time always uh \nglad to and happy to exchange with you \nall these thoughts and uh almost like in \nthe brainstorming fashion yeah and I'm \nexcited for the future of this with Chad \ngpg and all the breakthroughs that you \nguys are working on and and many players \non the market as well thank you \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Dmitry Kan on Neural
