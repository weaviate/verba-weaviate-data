{"text": "00:00 - Introduction 03:57 - Install Weaviate 10:05 - Running Weaviate with Docker 11:57 - Working with a Weaviate schema ... \nso again that is the the golden smith \nwas more to look at the setup schemas \nimporting uh data and working with \ngraphql within wv88 \nuh again there are other meetups planned \nas well more deep dives more about \nhorizontal scalability those kind of \nthings the goal of this one is more \ngeneric so we're going to look at \ninstallation as setup so how you can \nwork with the wv8 i'm going to run an \ninstallation \ni'm going to show you how you can \nconfigure an installation we're going to \ntalk about schema because \nsomething that is important within vv8 \nis the uh \nis the schema we it works for the schema \nwe're going to look at importing data \nwe're going to look at the clients that \nyou can use actually interact with the \napis coming out of ev8 \nand last but not least we're going to \nlook a little bit at the graphql \ninterface \num the graphql interface is often used \nto \nyou know show bf's capabilities \num in this situation i'm going to look \nmore at graphql from the perspective of \nwhen we create a scheme and if we work \nwith a schema \nso \nyou might have seen this drawing more \noften or is this visual and what we try \nto show with this visual is that \num \nwe've hit is not only a tool to work \nwith and secure machinery models it's \nactually a database on its own \nso what you see in the center and \nsomething that you also see when we go \nover the installation is that you can \nalso choose to run vf8 standalone we see \nalso some community members do that \nbecause for example they have their own \nvectors or they have very specific \nmodels that they want to work with \nand then the power sits in the fact that \nyou can store both the data object as \nyou can see here with my mouse and the \nfactory representation of \nthe data object how you're representing \nit \nand you can choose to or have fifa \nvectorized data for you so as you can \nsee here we have text factorization we \nhave image factorization we currently \nhave also some community members working \non audio we know people working on video \nbut what we now have out of the box is \ntext factorization and image \nvectorization \nor you have these other modules \nfor example to connect semantic search \nor question answering and those kind of \nthings so it's very important to bear in \nmind so you can you can use we've run \nwe've had standalone but then you have \nto provide your own vectors to represent \nyour data \nor you can use one of these modules to \nrepresent the data something we will \nalso go over \nimportant to bear in mind the the schema \nthat we'll be looking at abbreviate as a \nclass property \nschema \nimportant also to bear in mind that \nsometimes people refer to it as a graph \ndatabase which it is not with it is a \nvector database the focus is on \nvector search \nbut we've decided to adopt the \nthe graph data model \nthat we get from graphql to represent \nthe data so regardless if you think of \nvf8 as a \na nosql database where you have data \nobjects representing the data \nor maybe even if you look think a little \nbit more in in a sequel like structure \nwhere every i don't know every row or \nsomething has a as a factory \npresentation \nwe have chosen this representation and \nthe easiest way to think about that is \nthat every data object so what you see \nhere in the yellowish \ncircle with a clause on a property \ngets a vector representation that you \ncan place that in the vector space well \nthis is a very simplistic one because \nthis is an x y and as you will see later \nthese \nmachine learning models output \nmore complex vectors or more \nhyperspace vectors or if you want to \ncall them so but that's basically the \nconcept so that's what makes um \nvivid as a database \ndifferent so it's not \nfocusing necessarily pure on the nosql \npart \nnot purely focusing on on the graph part \nis really focusing on working with these \nwith these vectors \nso \nlet's dive right in from the perspective \nof the of the documentation so if you go \nto vvh documentation \nthis is the page where you start and the \nfirst thing that you want to look at is \nthe is the installation and one of the \nthings that we created to install with \nthis and the customize your we've yet \nset up \nway more information if you want to go \nmore into kubernetes or the cloud \nservice or what have you you can look at \nthose as well but \na nice way to get started is to look at \nthe uh the customizer and the customizer \nis just a menu where you can exactly \nwalk through to basically configure this \nimage \nso we start from the perspective of the \ncenter so what we've had version do you \nwant to use well needless to say that it \nalways starts with the hand but even \nwith the latest version \nso we selected abbreviated version \nthen you select the media type so the \nmedia type is referring to here what you \nsee with the text factorization or the \nimage vectorization \nso actually if i \nclick the drop down menu we can see text \nimages text and images \nor none \nif i select none i'm basically saying i \nonly want to use this center piece so \nthis is the piece that people are using \nif they just want to store their data \nobjects and have their own vector \nrepresentations \nwe're not going to do that so we're \ngoing to say like we're going to go for \na for a text media type \nand it automatically asks which one do \nyou want to use so we have two modules \nhere you see text modules \nand those are in line with the modules \nyou see in the left hand side the text \neffect modules \nso we have \nthe contextionary that is based on glove \nand and or fast text \nand is only utilizing cpu so this one is \noften used for for example \nclassification tasks or where speed is \nof the essence or where gpus are \nunavailable \nor we have the transformers \num \nso let's choose the transformers \nwe have a few pre-packaged transformer \nmodules as you can see here so the most \nused for semantic search \nhowever \nif you have your own \ntransformer model you can use it as well \nso \nwhat you can do is that you can if you \ngo into the \nso let's go in here so if you go into \nthe menu item of the text effect \ntransformers \nyou can even uh load a publicly \navailable hugging face model into \ninto one of these modules as well \nbut for now we're going to go with the \nprepackaged modules which means as much \nas as you will see in a bit that the \ncontainers are just we prepared the \ncontainers for you so you don't have to \ndo anything \nthen we have for example the q a module \nas you can see here as well so this is \nrepresenting this module \ni'm going to disable that for now \nwe have named entity recognition gonna \nof disabled as well spell check module \ni'm going to keep that \ndisabled as well \ngpu support so if you're running a \nmachine that supports gpu you can just \nsimply enable it \num \ni'm not going to do that because i'm not \ngoing to run it locally and i don't have \na \ngpu available on this on this laptop \num \nimportant to mention for these modules \nis that \neven if you want to um \nyou can oh let me accept somebody \nso what you can do is you can use these \nbasic modules but what you can even do \nis that you can create custom modules \nand we will \ndive a little bit further in what that \nexactly means but the last meetup from \ntwo weeks ago that my colleague laura \npresented \nshe really dives into these custom \nmodules but i'll say a few words about \nthat in a bit as well \nand so we're going to keep the gpu \nsupport disabled \nthen we have this is \na not for community users this is for \nenterprise users so i'm gonna use \ndisable this as well and then you can \nuse select your desired runtime and i'm \nrunning it on my local machine so i'm \ngonna go for docker compose \nand what you see that happens is just it \noutputs a curl command that downloads \nthe docker compose file \nand what i'm going to do is i'm just \ngoing to select this docker compose file \njust to look at it so that we can \nquickly look at what's actually \nhappening so \nwhat you see here \nis that wev88 is build so if we go back \nto this image again \neverything is packaged in separate \ncontainers so the more modules you \nselect that's perfectly fine but the \nmore containers you will be running \nso here you see of course the the the \nthe core container if you will \nthat is we've ate itself \nthere's some configuration attached to \nit which of course in the documentation \nyou can find more about that as well \nbut here for example you see that we've \nchosen the text-to-effect transformers \nmodule \nthe image that we pre-packaged that's \nrelated to that and we set cuda for gpu \nto zero \nand here you see that the inference api \nis actually here the transformers \nuh text-to-effect transformers at port \n8080 which refers to this one so if i \nnow would go back \nand if i would say well i'm going to \nthat's going to a previous step and \nlet's say \nthat i'm going to \nuh well let's enable the spell check \nmodule \nif i now go further and \ni look at another docker compose file so \ni'm going to select this as well \nthen you see \nthat in the configurator that's \nautomatically added right so you now see \nyour text \nspell check \nthe image that's related to that and \nthen you see that besides the \ntransformer inference api \num \nthere's also the spell check inference \napi so the more modules you add the more \nthat it automatically adds here \num and here you see actually the modules \nthat they are enabled there's not really \na restriction to it what you even can do \nwhich is not \navailable to the configurator because it \nwould be a very obscure setup but you \ncould even choose to have multiple \ninference apis for text-to-fact modules \nwhy that is is something that we will \nlook at at the \nwhen we look at creating the schema \nbut what i did i already downloaded one \nof these files so if i now uh look at \nthis file \nhere we go \nso here you see i've created one i've \ndownloaded a file which has a text \neffect transformer \ncuda is disabled um and of course vp \nitself so if you now currently look at \nmy talker setup which is nothing is \nrunning as you can see \ni can do simply do docker compose up and \nit will take these um this configuration \nso sometimes people say like hey these \nthese transformers uh containers are big \nthey are they are over a gigabyte \nbecause they contain the actual modules \nnow maybe also nice to look at what's \nhappening here because we sometimes get \nquestions about that as well \nis that the the messages that um \nwith outputs are as descriptive as \npossible \nso \nhere you see for example that we've it \nis \nstarted \nbut that it's waiting in this case for \nthe \ntransformer module to start up which \ntakes some time to boot \nand then in that container you see that \nit's \nrunning it's running on cpu \nat some point that's just like okay i'm \ni'm ready \nand then you see that we've here just \nlike okay um \nuh \nhere it says like i could not rebuild \nthe graphql schema which is correct \nbecause it's a empty weave gate \nand then it says okay i'm ready i'm \nserving with it at port 8080 and \nlocalhost \nwhich you can simply check by going \nthere so let's go to localhost \nand then you see this is website also \nhere to the api we try to be as \ndescriptive as possible to describe \nwhat's \nwhat's happening \nso for example hey you can look at the \nmeta endpoint to get some basic \ninformation \nbut also at the schema endpoint which \nbrings me to the next step in we've had \nbecause as we see from the menu that if \nyou now have a weave yet running the \nmost important thing is that you want to \ncreate while i say schemas \nthat you want to create a schema \nand the schema has the class property \nstructure \napologies the class property structure \nthat you wanna that you wanna represent \nand there's a bunch of data types \navailable for properties which we will \ngo over as well but if you go to the \nrestful api endpoint you look at \nthe schema \nyou can for example look at create a \nclass and it's explained exactly what's \navailable what options properties are \navailable there's a simple \nrequest available in any \nlanguage that you like \nor there's a complete example available \nwe are going to look at the curl example \nand the reason that i'm doing that is \nbecause i want to give you a demo that \nis a programming language agnostic \nso this is just purely speaking to the \nto the api \nimportant to know is that although some \nof the client libraries have specific \nfunctionality in them for example to \nregulate batching and those kind of \nthings \num \nin general everything is happening to \nthe api so the \nthe client libraries are just ways to \naccess the uh the restful api \nnow i prepared something here as well so \nif you want to write something to the \nschema as you can see here from the um \nuh \nephron we need to post something to v1 \nschema \nand the first thing that we might want \nto do is that we want to create a clause \nso let's look at that so \nwe want to create a clause and the \nclause a class name can be anything any \nnoun or any verb we are about to release \na \nless strict way of defining classes but \nfor currently for now these are \nwords the reason that we use words is \nbecause sometimes as you will see in a \nbit \nuh people \nwant to use the class names for the \nproperty names in the factorization \nprocess \nso let's \ntake for this example let's use the word \ndocument \nimportant to know every a class can have \nany \nyou can use any word so any noun \nthat you can think of to describe it and \nif you can even change \nchain them \nfor example if you would say like \ndocument about \ncars \nthis would be of oh \nwithout the typo this would be a valid \nclass name \nuh what we've heard would do if you \ndecide to factorize the class name it \nwould just use split these words like \nthis and say okay i'm gonna use the word \ndocument about and cars \nto \nfactorize content \nnext we want we need to give a \ndescription \nso let's say \nexample \nclass \nand then in the the list of information \nthat we need to provide are the other \nproperties \nso the properties is an array because as \nyou could see here \nin this example a class can have one or \nmore properties attached to it \nif you don't set any you need to set a \nproperty because if you don't set any \nproperty if there's no metadata \navailable to the \nuh to the class one thing that you \nalways get automatically and that you \ndon't have to set it with it is a unique \nidentifier with it will always assign an \nid or you can assign your own id \nthese properties are written with a \nlower case we kind of adopted that from \nan rdf kind of way of writing so a class \nstarts with a capital \nand um \na property starts with a with a \nlowercase so we can say name \nand then we can say for example title so \nfor example the document \nhas a title now what we also need to do \nwhat you can see from the scheme where \nwe need to provide it a \ndata type \nwhich i will copy here that's easier the \ndata types that we have available \nare \nhere \nso dear all the data types that we have \navailable \nso string string arrays integers integer \narrays etc \nwe also have \nblob data types \nand what is important to bear in mind \nthat is the vectorizer that you have \nchosen \nneeds that information so for example a \ntext vectorizer needs a string \nor a \ntext data type to to vectorize something \nbut if you for example would have chosen \nimage vectorizer you need to blob data \ntype because you the image that you will \nprovide with it with will be used to \ncreate that vector representation \nso let's keep that to string \nand then we need to always give it a \ndescription so let's also just say here \ntest \nproperty \nnow what is in this is the least amount \nof information that you need to give \nwe've yet um it will take all the \ndefault uh settings to to to create \nthese um \nthe class in this case however it is \ninteresting to take a look at a few \nspecific things that we can set and \nmost importantly when it comes to \nindexing \nit has to do with the module \nconfiguration so the module \nconfigurations you can set them it's \nbest to look at that here from the \nexample \nwe can be very specific for example \nabout the vectorizers that we want to \nchoose so \nlet's say that we have a case where we \nhave a text objects and image objects we \ncan actually tell vp8 i want you to \nfactorize one class for example with the \nwith the text effect vectorizer or with \nan image to fact vectorizer \nand here this is what i meant with \nfactorized class name you can set that \nto true or to false so let's just \ntake this information and just \nput it in so this is what it would look \nlike \nand what we've now done what we've now \ndone is that we've extended \nhere we go we've extended the \nconfiguration a little bit because it \nnow says vectorize class name is to true \nand i'm going to set that to false \nwhat that means is that if i would have \na document and i would have a title and \nthe title would be for example \nthe the title of i don't know an article \nwhat you would get is the following so \nyou would get a the class document \nthere is the property title and then the \ntitle is like \nlet's call it fubar \nwhat weave here does is that if i would \nset this to true \nwhat we it would do is that it would \nactually take literally the word \ndocument \nto create a vector representation of \nthat class name \nso if i now set this to false \nit will not take the document anymore so \nit will only now take the property name \nand the um and the content that we will \nadd later in the as data in the data \nobject \nso i can do the same thing here as well \nso and this by the way needs to be \ntransformer \nbecause it's like we're not using a the \ncontext scenario transformer and we can \ndo the equivalent for the uh here for \nthe properties \nso i'm going to copy that as well \nso here i'm saying \nlet's also put this to false \nalso transformer oh \nand what this would do is that if we say \nwell we're only going to take the \ninformation the data that we're going to \nstore in here to create a factory \npresentation \ndepends on your use case what you want \nbut we see in practice that actually \noften these are set to sorry these \nfactorize class name and factorize \nproperty name are set to false \nwhat does skip mean skip says like do \nyou want this to be part of the um \nof the vectorization process so \nlet's say for example that i create a \nsecond property let's just copy this \nand i'm \ngoing to call that \nsubtitle \nthere might be a situation where i \nthat i want to have these this \ninformation there but i did that i want \nto skip the \num \nthe factorization of the subtitle \nand i don't want to \nvectorize in this case the word subtitle \nso now it will only take the data that \nwe're giving as a title to vectorize \nuh \nlet's see so this by the way this needs \nto be lowercase \ni was like why is it red here we go \nso this for example would create a data \nobject that says like \num i'm going to create a \na class which is a document \nthat's the description example class the \nmodule configuration says like it's \nfocusing on transformers \nthat's the module that we selected that \nwe're running right now \nwe do not want to factorize the class \nname we have a property that is title \nand we have another property that is \nsubtitle they both take strings as data \ntypes \nand here we're going to skip the \nindexing and we're going to not um \nvectorize the property name \nlet me quickly double check that i set \nthat correctly \nlet's think it is transformers \nplural \nlet me also see if this is correct \nthere you go \nyeah so i think this should be correct \nso \nif i now gonna i don't know why this has \na \nred underline but basically i'm going to \npost as the json to \nthe endpoint localhost and then schema \nso \nhere we go \nlet's see if i made a mistake there \nand i didn't so what we now can do is \nthat if you go back to weave yet \nso you see this is the previous one we \nhad schema which has no classes but if \nyou now refresh it \nyou see here we have our document right \nand it you see it also set some basic um \nor default \nconfiguration but here we said for \nexample factorized class name to false \netc \nlet's see if i \nthis should have been transformers \nokay \nso here you see how it set that \ninformation and now it's important that \nif i now take this information and i go \nto the \nto the console if you go to \nconsole.semada technology so i'm now \ngoing to quickly jump to the \ngraphql interface i'll go back to the \nschema but just to show you something \nwhat you can do is you can always \nconnect to a vp8 that's running on your \nlocalhost so \nthat's just running that's just running \non your local machine or review \nconnected to it will never send any data \nto the cloud it's just \num \nit's just a front-end that you can \naccess the graphql interface easily so \nif i now connect it and i go to the \nquery module so what you can see is that \nwe've created the class document \nso if i now go in there and i say get \nlet me increase a little bit you will \nsee that the first class that i now can \naccess is document the one that we just \ncreated \nwhich has title and which has subtitle \nand if i now run this query you'll see \nthat it's empty because we haven't added \nany data \nnow \none more thing that i want to show to \nyou related to the um \nto the schema \nis that if we now create a new \nclass so we have here document and let's \nsay that we have a \nparagraph for example \nexample \nuh graph \nso we can say \nlet's say that we take also \nlet's say that we have content let's say \nthat is of the data type text \nso now we say like we have content that \nis text we're gonna not skip it so skip \nis false we're gonna not factorize the \nproperty name \nand we're gonna say \ntest property for paragraph \nbut what we now can also do is that we \ncan make a reference to document so how \nthat's often you see that we say in \ndocument \nfor example \nthe data type \nis going to be document \nbecause we just we have document \nso we can say like the data types \ndocument \num \nwe're gonna \nnot factorize anything related to that \nand that's property for \ndocument \ncraft \nnow if i'm not gonna run this sorry \ni'll just send it to the restful api \nhere we go \nif i now \nrefresh my um my current module look \nwhat i can do now i can a do again \nnow paragraph is also available \nand i can say well there was a there's \ncontent of the paragraph \nand in document \nso this is and then we have the data \nobject of the document \nand we can also see that if we refresh \nhere the schema now you see the document \nhere but you also see the paragraph here \nso this is in the most \nsorry this is in the most basic form a \nway to create the schema and how you can \nquery through it \nthat brings me to the \nimporting data and the clients \nso \nwhat we see \nis that a lot of people use the where's \nmy documentation yeah so a lot almost \nnobody uses the the curl uh uh endpoint \ni'm just using that to \nbe programming language agnostic \nso people choose one of these \n[Music] \nclient libraries to import data we see \nthat a lot of people use the \nthe python client so what you can see is \nthat if you add data which we call \nyou objects actually see so let me go \ndown here so you \noh \nwhere is it create a data object \nso have we say like we post to the \nobject's endpoint \nso here you see for example an example \nof a data object \nand then we see here we see the curl \nequivalent and this is the python \nequivalent \nwhat we do not have inside we've gate \nbut outside vp8 is for example \nways to automate batching so weave it \ndoes have a restful batching endpoint so \nthat you can add multiple \ndata objects at the same time but for \nexample one of the nice things that's in \nthe python client is that you can say \noh no sorry that's actually here \napologies \nso that you can say batch data and then \nhere in python for example you see there \nare all kinds of methods that you can \nuse method one method two et cetera to \nautomatically um uh create these bad \nsizes \nthis is \na very nice feature this was actually \nsuggested by one of the community \nmembers \nwhere it automatically determines uh \nbased on the setup of your v8 how many \num \nobjects can be can be processed \nso it automatically scales and and \ninsides and it decreases in size when uh \nthe machine needs some more time to \nprocess data for example \nlet me go back to \nobjects \nso let me create \none data object \nso \nlet's do that from the perspective of \ncurl as well so let me just copy this \nso what we here do is actually to add \nsomething \nis that we really follow the \nthe structure that we have in our schema \nso let's say for the sake of argument \nthat we're gonna work with the document \nso we know we have the class document \nyou can choose to specify your own \nunique identifier of affiliate do it so \ni'm gonna just go for \nuh \ni just wanna review do it \ni'm gonna set my title \nand then \nthis is the \ntitle of the \ndemo object \nand i believe we also had \nsub title \nthis is the sub \ntitle \nlittle \nsub title \nso here we see that in line with where \nwe here have \ndocument \nand the property title and subtitle \ni can actually define them right here \nwhen i add these data objects \nso let's go back to the graphql overview \nif i now run document \nand i say title subtitle there's no data \nin there right so it's empty \nso what i now can do is that i can take \nthis information \npaste it in \nmaybe it's a little bit nicer if i type \nthat to jq \nnow and what you see that's happening \nright now is that it added the data \nobject you already see the vector \nrepresentation that it gave the data \nobject \nand then you see like it created the \nclause it returned a 200 code \nit defined a unique identifier and here \nyou see the \nthe information that i that i added so \nwhen i rerun this query \nyou see here is our document and the \nthing is because we told we've yet that \nwe want to not only use the database but \nalso the text factorization part \nif i now say \nshow me the um sorry additional from the \nfactory representation \nthen it shows both the factory \npresentation as you can see \nas well as the uh the data itself where \ndid it get that vector uh from well it \ngot that vector from the \ntransformer module that we selected \ni'm going to take one more step so i'm \ngoing to step now into our demo data set \nbecause otherwise i'll i need to keep \nadding \nmanually keep adding \ndata objects \nso if i now go back to our documentation \nwhat is handy to know that is if you go \nto the \ngraphql interface examples \nyou see these green bulbs here where \nevery example query is something that \nyou can try out real time \nso here you see for example this data \nset has articles and publications \nso i give this example quite often so \ni'm just going to keep it short but here \nyou see like we have publication we have \na name \nwe have multiple data objects here \nall these data objects have these vector \nrepresentations that they've gotten from \nthe transformers module \nso now what i can do is something like \nthis something like this so i can say \nnear text \nlet me \nyeah \nconcepts and then for example \nmegazine about \nfashion limited to the first result \nand now it will vectorize based on the \ntext to factorize the query \nand it will match that against all the \nfactors that we have for in this case \npublications so if i run that query you \nsee it returns folk and we can even say \nfor folk that that has a factor \nrepresentation \nas well so this is the factory \npresentation in this case representing \nscroll down all the way \nfocus \nso that is how \nthe schema \nis used within we've gate to add data so \nimportant as a quick recap \nso we have chosen in this setup to only \nwork with the text vectorization and of \ncourse the vva database itself \nyou can choose multiple modules if you \nlike \nand these modules what they do is that \nthey add here in for every class \nthey add functionality so to give you a \npractical example in this data set this \ndata set has a \ntext vectorizer \nbut it also has for example the question \nanswering module enabled and so what the \nquestion answering \nmodule does is so let's say i can say \ntitle i can say summary \nso this data set contains a few thousand \narticles so if i say ask \nask is enabled by setting the question \nanswering module \ni can say question and then i can say \nsee \ni can tell we've yet to find the answer \nin the summary \nlimited to the first result and bear in \nmind \nask only becomes available if you in the \nconfiguration if you've enabled the \nquestion answering module you don't have \nto it's only if you need it \nand then also this additional feature \nbecomes available which is of course \nanswer and then result and certainty \nso this is an example of using the q a \nmodule over this data set so if i run \nthis query you see that it retains the \nanswer based on all these articles \nso that's how you based on your use case \ncan decide what kind of modules you like \nand sometimes we even see people that \ncreate our own modules \nagain if you want to create your own \nmodule look at the previous meetup video \nby michael diglara where she explains in \ndetail how that works how you can create \nyour own modules \netc let's see if there's more \nnope that is basically i know i'm \ntalking for 35 minutes already that's \nbasically what i wanted to share so i'm \nvery curious to hear if that if you have \nany questions based on this presentation \nthanks for listening by the way \ni have a question \ni have a data set which \nit contains uh \nbasically it's it's a json uh and some \nof the \nthe classes that i have they have \nsubclasses of it so if i want to make \nproperties out of it how do how do i get \nchilds in my uh \nin my schema \nyeah so the the best way to do that is \nwith work with these with these \ncrawfrest and cross references so let me \nquickly share my screen again \nand you can make as many cross \nreferences as you like so i'm going back \nto this \ndemo data set with these articles \nso let me write a very simple query \nnothing fancy happening here so and \nthis query says as much as like okay \nshow me the first article that you have \nin the the data set \nright so here we just have a an article \nthat said the title \nbut as you said you have sub classes now \nthis an article actually also has a \nsubclass because it's in a publication \nso what we can say now is like in \npublication \non publication \nand then the name and what you will see \nif i run this query \nyou see that this is this is an article \nthat was published on fox news \nand as you can see it is a nested \ndata object and you can even \ngo as far as \nkeep these nets going so you can have \nlike a nested \ncross reference in your data object \nwhich can have another \nnested data object etc so for example i \nthink here we have for example \nhas articles \nso then i can even go as far as his \narticle oh yes \nsorry \narticle apologies \nand it says title so this is not a nice \ncircular thing so we go from articles \nwe take the first article title we look \nat the publication that it has which has \na name which we know is fox and which \nhas articles again so then we can say \nokay show me then those articles \nso if you know you see how that's nested \nso \nwe have a title which is the in \npublication \nfolks which has articles again \nand now if i open that you see the \narticles that are in here \nand one more way to show this is that \nfor example if you now look at it from \nthat perspective not from the articles \nbut from the publications you could say \nfor example \npublication \nname \nnow let me also \nsay like \nlimit \none \nso you say and that's again that's fox \nso now i can also see here it has \narticles \nhome article \nso that is how you can how you can chain \nthem together what's also nice to know \nis that you can even use these \nvector searches within them so for \nexample \nthe publication example that i showed \nwith uh \nfolk for example \nif when i say okay concepts \nand then \nseeing \nabout fashion and then i say limited \nuh \nlimited to the first result \nso what you will see here \nthat let me close this so it shows folk \nand then it shows actually the articles \nthat are in vogue so here you see all \nkinds of fashion related articles \nso hopefully that answers the question \nany other \nquestion that i can answer \nsilence on the goal \nwe got uh unview myself here so you were \nsaying that laura two weeks ago gave a \ncustom modules meetup and in the future \nyou're going to talk about horizontal \nscaling is that \nkind of the access to information \nuh sorry one more time the last part of \nthe of the of the question \nso yeah you mentioned uh laura had done \nthe the custom modules before that's \nalready available but the or you would \nalso talk about horizontal scaling \nand yes that in the future that that \ndoesn't exist right now in \noh yeah you can actually so let me share \nmy screen again \nso the um \nin the document documentation \nso if you go to uh custom modules \nyou can actually see there's a video so \nthat's from two weeks ago where lara is \npresenting how you can create custom \nmodules \nthe \nif you look at the architecture and the \nroadmap there's a video from my \ncolleague achen talking about the deep \ndive and the complete roadmap \ntwo weeks from now there will also be a \nmeetup that's only about \nhorizontal scalability and i believe \nthat even the first uh release candidate \nwill be presented in two weeks for for a \nhorizon scalability so \nwe aim to have horizontal scalability \navailable in in just a few weeks from \nnow \nperfect thank \nyou very welcome \nany other questions that i can answer \nin \nthat case \nif there are no other questions \nthen um the last thing for me to say is \nlike thank you very much for your time \num thank you for listening \num you can come on our slack channel if \nyou like so there's like a lot of people \non the slack channel where you can ask \nquestions where you can interact with \nwith the team \nyou of course also have the uh \nthe documentation that i just showed you \neverything is available to the website \neverything is part of the open source \npackage \nso um we're looking very much forward to \nhere the the things that you're building \nwith wv88 and again that well thank you \nso much for uh \nfor listening and have a nice rest of \nthe day or nice evening depending on \nwhere you are in the world but \nthank you so much \nsee you next time everybody thank you \nbye bye thanks \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Meetup \u2013 Getting Started (setup, vectorizers, schemas, importing
