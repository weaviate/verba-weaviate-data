{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the 37th episode of the Weaviate podcast! This episode discusses some of the ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nchecking out another episode of the weva \npodcast I'm super super excited about \nthis one we have Jerry Liu the creator \nof gbt index and we've yet CEO and \nco-founder Bob Van light so firstly \nthank you both so much for joining the \nweba podcast \nthanks Connor it's great to try \ngreat to be back on you know our own \npodcast \nawesome so uh Jerry could we dive into \nthe origin story of gbt index what led \nyou to create this incredible tool yeah \nfor sure so you know uh these days qpt \nindex is a primary tool to build an \ninterface between your large language \nmodel and your external data and this \nseems to be a problem that's resonated \nwith a lot of people in the community \nand when I first started playing around \nwith llms about a few months ago \num I was actually trying to build a \nbasic sales bot so basically you know \num to address some of uh customer \nconversations uh from notion Salesforce \ngong Etc and I wanted to use the \ngenerative capability of lens on top of \nthis data to actually build a to-do \nsynthesizer for me for for the next \nmeeting so basically do some sort of \nmeeting preparation \nand of course whenever you try using \nthis amazing technology on your own data \nyou start the first thing you run into \nis the token limitation and the cost per \ntoken right so one of the things that \num you basically have to figure out is \nokay well you know DaVinci right now is \n4 000 words how can I actually stuff all \nthis information into the prompt so that \nit has the context to actually \nsynthesize the information that I want \nnow four thousand words is actually a \ndecent amount for you know a cache but \nof course it's not enough to feed in \nyour entire database of information and \nthat leads to uh you know figuring out \nhow to build interfaces for stuff like \nchunking for stuff like being able to do \nbetter retrieval so that you can \nactually craft The Prompt in a way that \nactually solves your task \num and so I started this off as you know \na design project uh built this thing \ncalled a tree index which basically \nhierarchically built a tree over your \nexternal data that you could then use \ngbt to look up afterwards however I \nthink since then it's grown from a \ndesign project into an everyday tool \nthat people are actually using on top of \ntheir llm projects so I think that part \nis is uh super cool to see and I'm very \nexcited to watch it develop more I would \nlove to I love to learn more about the \nexecuted tree that you're building so \nit's like you just went over it very \nquickly but just I remember that we had \nour first goal and I should talk us \nthrough it and it was like super \nexciting so can you talk a little bit \nmore about what you're actually doing \nthere like at the core of GPT index \ndefinitely I mean again I think I just \nwant to emphasize that that started off \nas a design project and you know it's \nit's one of those things where I kind of \njust um made it up into something that I \nthought was pretty cool uh I think you \nknow these days practically speaking \nthere is a bit of limitations \npractically in terms of actually using a \ntree on top of large corpses of data \nhowever \num the uh the the Paradigm that I \nbasically started with was okay so you \nhave this big Corpus of text now what if \nyou basically just hierarchically built \na tree over this text so what happens is \nlet's say you take every 10 pieces of \ntext or 10 paragraphs and then you build \na summary over every 10 paragraphs then \nyou build the next uh set of parent \nnodes on top of this then you build a \nnext set of summaries over these uh \nsummaries that you just built and then \nyou kind of build the tree all the way \nuntil you have a set of root notes right \nand to me this is one way of uh almost \nlike information compression such that \nyou basically build some sort of data \nstructure that you can then use with gbt \nafterwards and so you know when gbt \nwants to look up a piece of information \nit can start from the top and then go \ndown this tree to actually find the \ninformation that it wants \num and you know if you uh The Way We \nBuilt This was quite naive and simple it \nwas just you know aggregating every 10 \nTrunks and building this like \nhierarchical tree over it you could \nimagine this generalizing to graph \nstructures which are actually a GPT \nindex supports through kind of more \nsophisticated means now and basically \nbuilding a Knowledge Graph over your \ndata and using this knowledge graph and \nleveraging this knowledge graph to \nactually feed into LGBT so uh the way \nthe tree index started was again just \nbuilding hierarchy over a set of text uh \nand then when you actually want to send \nin a prompt or query you can start from \nthe top and then of the tree and then go \ndown until you actually find the pieces \nof information that you want these days \nyou know I think the thing that works \nthe best actually probably isn't the \ntrivia next though you know it was a \ncool thought experiment and we do use \nparts of that and you see parts of that \nlive on through other pieces of the tool \nthese days the most basic thing that \npeople start with is uh you uh take in \nthe Corpus of documents uh split it up \nuh you know embed each trunk and then \nthrow it in a vector store right so like \nweeviate or you know another Vector \nstore and then during uh query time you \njust retrieve uh top k \num uh you know documents or chunks by \nembedding similarity \nand put it into the prompt and so this \nis a bill has a bit less structure than \nfor instance something like the tree \nindex or a Knowledge Graph it actually \nworks surprisingly well for probably I \nwould say like 40 50 of use cases right \nfor of like basic queries \num but I think this uh idea of the tree \nindex which then generalized into this \nidea of like defining a composability \nand knowledge graph of your data is now \nuh quite uh uh has the potential to to \nallow you to Define more complex \nstructures of your data as opposed to \njust kind of random you know \num like just fetching different chunks \nof the room batting lookup yeah so so \nmaybe I I'm still kind of wrapping my \nhead around the knowledge graphic \nextension as well as this whole kind of \ntop level index thing so let's say I \nhave podcast Clips is like the example \nthat I've been using to think through \nthese things so if I I aggregate say \nfive at a time to form a summary and \nthen from there I'm going to summarize \nthose to like summarize the next thing \nso when I'm searching through this index \nin my first searching so I say I'm \ntrying to find just a conversation \nsegment do I first search through all \nthe summaries then I search through \nthese intermediate summaries like can \nyou kind of take me through like how the \nsearch works through the top level index \nyeah so \num there's a few points here uh that I I \ndo want to address \num taking a step back just really quick \nyou know the the gbt index is always \nevolving as a tool and going back to the \nhigh level Vision it really is about \nbuilding this interface and thinking \nabout what exactly is a best interface \nand the set of tools that we can give \nusers to you know build some structure \nover their data to solve their tasks and \nso so a lot of the tools that you see \nwith LGBT index today are manifestations \nof that so stuff like you know we offer \nIntegrations with Vector stores we offer \nthe ability to Define graphs on top of \nyour data it's possible as these models \nevolve and you know as considerations \ncome in for instance stuff like latency \nand cost these structures will also \ninvolve so to take what I'm saying right \nnow with like a slight grain of salt in \nthat I think we're sold very much \noptimizing towards okay what exactly is \nthis like best structure of data that \naccounts for again latency costs and \nperformance and that solves a broad \nrange of different use cases from you \nknow customers and Enterprises so with \nthat said you know one of the things \nthat we we thought about in the \nbeginning was to \num uh and and this is something that \nwe've heard from users of GPA indexes \nyou know uh uh it it's \num it's hard to kind of feed like high \nlevel context into uh into for instance \nlike a text trunk for uh as an example \nso when you take in a document and if \nyou just naively you know split it up uh \nand and now within each tax dunk you \nkind of lose some information about what \nthe entire document is about so going \nback to an example of say like a book \nyou know if a book is divided into \ndifferent chapters \num or actually maybe a better example is \nlike a research paper uh research paper \nis divided into different sections like \nintro related work methodology and then \nwithin each section you know you're \ngoing to have subsections describing \ndifferent components of each section now \nif you split this entire text up into \ndifferent trucks and let's say you just \nhave like section 2B and some random \nslice of that you're gonna not really \nhave information about how this relates \nto the rest of the paper so one pain \npoint that this idea of defining a graph \nover your data can solve is that you can \nkind of like hierarchically build uh or \nyou you kind of have this like hierarchy \nof context both like very fine grain \ncontext and then also kind of like \nhigher up context with the summary and \nso one thing one use case that GP index \nwith these graphs allow you to do is \nlet's say you do say build an index for \nevery subsection of your of your paper \nand then then you build an index for \nevery section like so you set a summary \nfor every you know intro uh like related \nwork methodology and then now when you \nactually query this you know kind of \nparent top level index it can both \nretrieve specific sections \num of text that are relevant to your \nquery but also refine it with with \nhigher level contacts and this happens \nbecause you're able to define a sort of \ngraph over your data \nanother use case of this is \num you know again what is the final \ngraph of your data me and at least \ninterview BC Index right now it \nbasically just means you can Define like \nindices on top of other indices and so \nanother use case that this could uh \nthis could solve is let's say you define \na sub index for every data source so \nlet's say you have a collection of uh \ncall transcripts in gong and then you \nhave a collection of notes in notion \nright and let's say maybe you have some \nconversations in slack now when you want \nto \num like uh uh ask a question let's say \nyou explicitly want to want to \nsynthesize and answer across all three \ndata sources now what you can do is you \nask this question and you define a sub \nindex for each one of these data sources \nand then you define this like higher \nlevel index at the top level and now \nwhen you ask a question we just route \nthis question to all three of these data \nsources and then we combine them with \nthis top level index for instance using \nuh one thing that GPT index offers is \nlike a list index data structure which \nis synthesize and answer across every \nsingle uh node in its structure so so \nbasically this allows you to just \ncombine information from all these \ndifferent sources into one response so \nit's it's quite an interesting thing you \nknow like I \num I I uh I think people are still \nexperimenting with different use cases \nof uh such a structure this idea of a \nKnowledge Graph but the idea of just \nlike being able to Define some sort of \nlike hierarchies uh over your data has \nproven to uh sometimes yield better \nresults depending on your use case \nvery interesting I I have a question \nabout like a term that you that you keep \nmentioning you keep using the term \nKnowledge Graph and I find it \ninteresting because it has that has kind \nof a it's of course already also kind of \nan older term if you will was also very \nmuch related to the to the semantic web \nand I think that if we talk about \nknowledge graphs today \num uh or like the traditional way of \ntalking about a Knowledge Graph was \nmostly also related to just you know \njust having notes in your graph and then \nand then just having just you know fixed \nrelations between them maybe like using \nSparkle or those kind of things \none thing that I find interesting and \nand in in uh in in wifi8 we also support \nlike simple route structures right so \nyou can just make cross-references and \nsometimes I also use the term \nKnowledge Graph to talk about this right \nthat is like it seems that there's like \na change happening where these the notes \nin the uh in the graph are not just on a \n2d plane right so just like a graph and \nthen relates to another one but then we \nactually placing these notes into the \nhyperspace that these models give us \nthrough these embeds right so the \nquestion I think I have \na little bit speculative but could it be \nthe case that the um sorry that um for \nexample GPT index or in combination with \nlike a effect store like with it could \nbe like a new Revival of the of the \nknowledge graph like the knowledge graph \n2.0 or would I be too ambitious uh if I \nwould say those kind of things curse \nwhat you think about that \nconceptually that absolutely could be \nthe case I think there are a few \npractical uh limitations and challenges \nthat we would have to solve to make this \nwork \num but there are already components that \nyou can kind of see within GBC index and \nyou could totally integrate with the \nback end store like uh we did so um \nthere's \num the part that GBC index supports \nright now is given you know a \nuser-defined graph uh let's say they \nconstruct it within GP index tools uh we \ncan then you know \num uh kind of perform operations over \nthis graph right we can then route like \nperform have a query and Route it \nthrough the knowledge graph to get to \nthe right information that it needs to \nanswer this this query \num there's also this separate component \nof Knowledge Graph construction right \nwhich like uh right now uh you you uh \nusers uh have to build a little bit \nmanually \num on on top of their data at least with \nNGP index and you know I think it's also \na very interesting question to think hey \nlike you know what uh are ways to \nbasically \num infer a Knowledge Graph right from \nunstructured data uh and and you know \nlike maybe we can generalize Beyond this \nidea of like a Knowledge Graph just uh \ngoing back to the mission statement of \nGPT index is like what is the best \nstructure over your data that we can \ninfer \num you know most of the world right now \nor at least in terms of data and fraud \nlives on structured data right and then \nnow of course there's a lot of uh stuff \ntaking off around like unstructured uh \ndata paired with Vector stores and then \nthere's this idea of knowledge graphs \nand so figuring out you know how to \nextract for instance like entities from \nthis data either in a structure format \nand a graph format or as like raw \ninstructor text I think these are all \nvery interesting questions think about \nand you could totally use gbt to uh to \nuh you know at least in the ideal state \nto automate a lot of this ingression and \ntransformation and so I think that is \nabsolutely something that you know \nespecially as these models improve like \ngbt index would want uh want to be at \nthe Forefront of \nuh so I think so I think like there \nthere are really these \num two components and and uh right now \none thing that gbt index does is it \nallows people to uh Define uh you know \ngraphs uh on their own on top of their \ndata and be able to you know route \nqueries through through these structures \nbut I think you know the the line of \nwork that we're very excited about \nimproving is how can you infer different \ntypes of structures one thing that gbt \nindex does offer right now is we can \nallow you to pass in your unstructured \ndata and we can actually \num infer structured data points from \nthat and put it in for instance like a \nSQL database \num one line of work that we do want to \ndo is do a bit more in terms of thinking \nabout how to best address and store \nunstructured data in different formats \nuh outside of just like naive text \ntrunking for instance right and so one \nuh feature that users have asked for is \noh how can I inject like Global metadata \ninto each structure text trunk to \npreserve some sort of global context \nI have a quick question about it because \nI find it so intriguing so so so so so \nso Conor and I we we did a little bit of \nresearch also with the with the we were \nlooking at like creating feedback loops \nalso with um \num with the database right so that you \nhave a query that goes into ev8 and then \nwhat we currently do with the generative \nParts actually goes into ev8 and then \nyou get like your candidates and then \nyou bump that through like or pipe the \nsub pump through a generative uh \num model and then you can do you can \ngive it a prompt right you can give the \ntask and what we were playing around \nwith was that we were saying like \num you know can we also ask the model \nfor example like to just do another \nquery in vv8 and as part of the prompt \nwe basically said like we want you to \npopulate this Json object right with \nthis key and this action and \nto my surprise I was just yeah maybe I \ndon't know I was just flabbergasted that \nit actually did that but it it yeah you \nremember that we worked on a counter \nthat it presented the results as a Json \nobject and they were like but that's \namazing because then we can really have \nlike more functional uh do more \nfunctional things with with the model so \nthe reason I'm bringing this up is I \nwould love to learn you said something \nso interesting about like uh how you're \nlooking at having the llm help in \ncreating the structure would it be \nsomething similar as that I just \nmentioned or is it something completely \ndifferent \noh 100 I mean I think that would uh I I \num it's actually a pretty interesting uh \nway to to try to uh get llamson for uh \ndifferent types of data um the use case \nat gbt index does right now is it \ninfrastructure data from unstructured \ndata um I have seen uh uh people play \naround with different tools I'm sure \nyou've seen this too where you know you \njust ask your PT that hey just like \nstore context within the prompt itself \nand then just give me back like another \nJson object also in the prompt \num and so you just see in the prompt you \njust feed in like your entire like Json \nobject and then and then it'll give give \nyou back a new Json object for instance \num I think uh yeah I think I think these \nare something things are we're \nexperimenting with I think there's \nprobably like a few limitations to for \ninstance just like storing context and \nstate within the prompt entirely just \nbecause again due to like token size \nlimitations but if you can somehow again \nmaintain some sort of structure and then \nhave gbt index be able to both read the \nstructure and be able to know how to \nupdate this structure uh you know and \nthis structure is maybe stored outside \nof the prompt itself uh in some format \nthat but then you can feed parts of it \ninto the pump then that that part is \nvery interesting to um to think about \nbecause I think um yeah like imagine you \nmaintain this Json structure but then \nyou were able to feed parts of this into \ngbt index so uh still a beta token size \nlimitation but it provides uh gbt enough \ncontext to help update and insert new \nelements into this overall structure I \nthink that's going to be really \ninteresting \num there's also stuff around for \ninstance like Knowledge Graph inference \nwhich you know like imagine \num you know given this content you can \nextract like entities from this content \nand then you can then in for \nrelationships between the entities and \nnow you know I like \num there's this cool project called like \ngraph3pt where I think uh it was this \nyou know front-end visualization and \nthey had this like a nice front end but \nuh what they did was they basically you \nknow took in this user query and then uh \nbasically directly asked gbt to infer \nthe structure uh directly within the \nprompt so like it kind of like given the \noutput it should infer all the \nrelationships within the data that you \nyou feed it I think that's also \nsomething I've kind of been interested \nin for GTA index but maybe extending \nthat to also storing the structure \nOutside The Prompt itself and then you \nknow given some unstructured data like \nstart building up some knowledge graph \nover your entities within the structure \nthat you can then you know query over \nwith with gbt index uh so you know lots \nof very interesting things around not \njust like the query side of things using \nolives but also actually how to \nconstruct these types of structures \nusing hpvd as well \nyeah well when I when I think of \nKnowledge Graph I also think of this \nlike um you know like Conor lives in \nBoston you know works at weviate like \nthat kind of structure where it's you \nthe the data structure is to collapse \nthe entities into the single thing it's \nmade me think about like um so if I have \nlike coming back to the podcast clip \nexample I might extract the entities and \nthen use that to go get the facts and \nthen add that to the prompt \nthat kind of thinking is is it yeah is \nwhat it is inspired me but I kind of if \nI could come back to something else you \nwere saying about the integration of \ndifferent data sources like slack uh the \ncalls \nthese kind of things and it makes me \nthink that like so in weviate usually \nthe thinking is we would divide these up \ninto different classes and so then just \nthe atomic units each of them lives in \ntheir own Vector index like based on the \nthis is the slack Vector Index right so \nso are you taking all the atomic units \nof all the different data sources and \nputting them all in one kind of vector \nindex and then you build up the \nhierarchy from that kit like how does \nthe kind of chunking of atomic units in \nindex construction happen \nuh yeah that's a good question I think \nyou know it makes sense to me for all \nthese different data sources to be \nstored in different uh structures uh so \nuh for instance if there are different \nweeviate tables or just like different \nyou know indices \num I think what we would do is we'd \nprobably want to maintain that structure \nso we don't want to like you know \ncollapse all the data into one table uh \non on our end but what we'd probably \nwant to do is let's say you have use \ncases where you do want to for instance \nlike synthesize a response across all \nthree different data sources or you want \nto route a query to the best set of data \nsources that can answer your question we \nwant to you know treat for instance \nthese data sources and we V8 as three \ndifferent sub-indices and then allow you \nto build some index structure on top to \nactually solve your use case whether \nit's summarization or uh routing for \nquestion answering \nso then that routing that's um that's \nthe the llm tool use where you tell it \nhey you have you know slight \nconversations blog posts right \noh kind of yeah so so there's different \nways you can you can think about this \none is you can directly do this within \nGPS index itself it's actually part of \nthe graph so just imagine like a parent \nuh node that's \num you know at the top of the graph and \nthen each trial node is like your \ndifferent data source so you have like \nthree trial nodes one slack one is an \nocean one is you know uh gong or \nSalesforce and then you can have a \nparent node at the top that acts as a \nrouter so then you can actually you know \ngiven a query like pick and choose which \nof these uh trial nodes is most relevant \nto your query \num you can also actually integrate this \nwith kind of multi-step agent behaviors \nand you know for instance like Lane \ntrain has an agent abstraction where you \ncan actually act in some sort of \nmulti-step Manner and can choose between \ndifferent tools \num then you know you can also have these \ndifferent uh sub indices B tools that \nthis agent can choose from so part of it \nis just dependent on which abstraction \nlayer you want to build at \num if you do want to kind of wrap this \ninto entire thing around a GPT index \nlike data structure you could to solve \nyour use case \nyeah so yes I think the whole the agent \nthing is a whole conversation like \nbecause I don't want to get too off of \njust kind of understanding the sub \nindices and all that but maybe if we \ncould come into just the tool used the \nexternal apis and all of how that's \nintegrated with GPD index yeah so sorry \njust like clarified do you mean like the \nline training tools or do you mean yes I \nthink kind of I've been so I'm so sorry \nfor the slower so I'm still trying to \nlike process the understanding of the um \nthe sub indices and all that but so I \nthink in addition to the sub indices \nwhich is like a data structure there's \nalso like the tool used am I correct in \nthinking that these are two separate \nthings like the the llm tool use and \nthen sort of using GPT to create these \nindices or those like you see those as \nseparate yeah so um I can try to help \nclarify it uh that's a little bit more \nat a high level um I know uh the way I \ndescribed it was probably a little bit \ncomplicated \num but basically in in my mind \num \nimagine GBC index like a data structure \nlike quote unquote you know we we have \nthat term \num just imagine that as a interface to \nyour data and so the like imagine that \nentire thing as a black box right so you \nyou've given some question and at the \nend of the day you want to define a \nstructure so that you get back the \nresponse that you want right that's \nthat's kind of everything within that \nbox is that data structure that we uh \nallow you to uh allow you to create so \num if we just operate purely within the \nthe tooling of gbt index \num going back to that example of having \nfor instance like sub indices what I \nmean is let's say you define like a \nseparate index data structure for you \nknow all your notion uh notes and then \nalso your slack conversations \nall right now what you can do is you can \nactually Define say like a top level uh \ndata structure over these um uh you know \nsub indices or individual data sources \nuh and this top level data structure can \ntake on different forms \num it could act you know as it could be \nlike a list index which is like a \nsummarizer basically it can you know \num uh it'll route the query to each \nindividual data source but then combine \nall the responses into one response it \ncan act as a router where it actually \npicks like a subset of these uh sub \nindices to actually dive into and then \nin the end it'll synthesize a response \nfrom the sub indices but basically just \nimagine say you know you have some \nparent node as a graph and it can route \nit to some you know data structures as \nsub indices if you will and so if you \nchoose to you could wrap this entire \ngraph including the parent node and the \ntrial nodes into one Gypsy index data \nstructure that you can then you know say \nquery for uh summarization or as a query \nfor question answering and then we'll \nroute the queries underneath the hood \nright based on your graph to actually \nsynthesize the response that you want \nhopefully that that makes a little bit \nof sense but the idea is that you can \nkind of allow users to Define some graph \nquote-unquote structure of your data to \num kind of you know Define uh \nhierarchies to solve the tasks that you \nwant and at the end of the day it's just \nallowing you to be able to query over \nsome data and then you're able to get \nback the response that you would want \num the Integrations with other tools for \ninstance like Line train is a separate \ncomponent of this so for instance like \num one thing that you a lot of users are \ntrying to do is let's say you define an \nindex structure over your data let's say \nyou know you define \njust a simple Vector store base index \nover your notion notes or your slack \nconversations and but let's say you're \nbuilding a chat bot right and you want \nto use like Link train to do that so you \ncan build a light train tripod which \nwill maintain your conversation history \nand this agent will also try to look up \nor try to use different types of tools \nuh in its repertoire to actually perform \ndifferent actions or perform lookups so \nyou can actually add these indices as \ntools within \num you know kind of like the set of \ntools that Adrian can use so that uh \nwith this subtraction every time the \nagent is trying to reason about a step \nthey can choose a tool that will help it \nperform you know uh uh that that's like \nthe best tool suited to to perform the \naction that's requested of it and this \ncool tool could be a gbt index uh data \nstructure right and again going back to \nthe fundamental interface what you can \nsee indexes you can pass in that query \nright some request and you'll get back \nsome something out of it and the this \ntool could uh like this GPT index data \nstructure could be arbitrarily \ncomplicated it could be very simple like \njust a vector store index or it could be \nan entire graph structure underneath but \nan agent can choose to you know \num basically use this as a tool to get \nback the response as it needs at a high \nlevel you can basically think of this as \nyou know um one thing that like the \nagents do really well is that they can \ndo multi-step reasoning \num but you can treat GPT index as one \nstep right of this multi-step reasoning \nto achieve uh retrieve the information \nthat you would want \ninteresting I I so while you were \ntalking about this I I have a quick \nfollow-up question related to that \nbecause \nthe \num it for me making like these these \nthree structures that that makes a lot \nof sense to me it's also I find it super \nintriguing in in how you how you uh um \nuh how you you know walk down the tree \nbasically to find the answers I I have \ntwo questions about that so one is like \nlet's say that I have like a large \ndocument because actually this is \nsomething I don't know let's say I don't \nknow like really large like 100 Pages \nsomething right or like 100 paragraphs \nthat's maybe easier how what what does \nthe how much insurance is it doing on \nthe model to find the the answer and how \nmuch time would it take just to produce \nan answer so how often are we talking to \nthe model how often is GP index able to \nknow where it needs to Traverse to \nwhat's what's what are we talking about \nhere yeah so um no it's a good question \nand I think uh again uh this probably \nwarrants like a broader discussion about \nsome of the trade-offs you make when \ndefining these graph structures \nespecially with the current state of uh \nGPT \num imagine every node of uh whatever \ngraph that you define right if it's a \ntree structure let's say you know you \nhave two levels like a para node and \ntrial node \nevery node is going to require some llm \ncall maybe two right to to gbt now \num you know there is uh some sort of \nlike practical like cost and latency \ntrade-off that you're gonna have to \nthink about when you actually Define \nthese complicated graphs over your data \nbecause I think conceptual it's very \ninteresting it makes a lot of sense but \nevery call to gbt is going to take \naround like you know two to three \nseconds if you just give it like uh you \nknow three thousand four thousand tokens \nright and it's going to incur a marginal \ncost as well so there are just some \npractical constraints in making this \ngraph overly complicated because the \nmore nodes that you add and the more \nnodes that attribute index has to \nTraverse the more alaline calls there \nare going to be and then you know the \nthe kind of longer and have to wait for \nyour response \num so I I think you know for a lot of \ntree structures uh practically speaking \nwhat uh has worked well or just a \nslightly more shallow structures so a \nvector store a base lookup actually \nmakes a decent amount of sense \num because actually it for an embedding \nbased query you don't really need to \ncall the L one at all right you just do \na DOT product and then the only calls \nyou need to make are to the embedding \nmodel during construction and then maybe \na call to the language model finally if \nyou want to like synthesize and answer \nright from the set of nodes that you \nretrieved through embedding lookup so \nembedding lookups can can be a pretty \npractical like uh cheaper alternative to \nthat \num but I think yeah generally speaking \nyou know hopefully as these models get \nbetter and the costs and latency does \ncome down this notion of repeatedly \nquerying or recursively querying the llm \nfor more information has already proven \nto be pretty useful in a lot of cases \nlike if you think about just like you \nknow Chain of Thought prompting react \nquote traversing through knowledge \ngraphs it's evaluation it's all very \ninteresting but that stuff will be more \npossible once we solve some of the \nPractical constraints \nyeah and I'm actually this is so \ninteresting because this goes back to \nthe thing we we just discussed um uh \nabout that we're looking at how can we \nuse basically the llm to just also feed \ndata back into into V8 and what I like \nso much about Jeep index is that that \nyou support like these graph connections \nso it something that I'm super \ninterested in in like also further \nfiguring out is that rather than just \nhaving this combination of GPT index and \nthen view it as a vector store that \nstoring these connections as well uh so \nbasically that if you if you if you do \nthe query like for the first time you \nknow it needs to go to the model needs \nto figure it out but it can not only \nstore for example the embeddings but \nalso the \num the graph connections that it's \nmaking that is something that I'm I'm \nsuper excited about because I would not \nbe surprised that this year we're gonna \nsee this trend of yeah for the the term \nthat I'm now using is just creating a \nfeedback loop back into the database \nusing using tools like for example GPT \nindex and I find that super interesting \nI'm I'm I would not be surprised if we \nsee some prototypes in the in the near \nfuture exactly doing that because \nthen you could even say like hey \num uh um you know Jeep DNS I want you to \nfigure something out for me I'll be back \ntomorrow you know and I'll just it \nstarts to Traverse it starts through the \nlookups it starts to add stuff to the \ndatabase and then the next day you see \nall these graph connections and \nrelations in the database and now you \ncan fast and quickly Traverse over it I \nI find this very intriguing it's it's \nsuper interesting super interesting \nI find it very interesting too I mean I \nthink \num if once these part of this is a bet \nthat these models will get better or \nfaster and cheaper and then you can \nstart using it to really automate some \nof your uh more of your kind of like \ndata ingestion and transformation \npipelines and reduces the human workload \non really thinking about okay what is \nthe best structure of your over your \ndata right because a lot of data \nengineering once this does get better to \nsome degree quality well uh uh I can't \nkind of hopefully try uh be solved \nsomewhat by by being able to um uh infer \na lot of these relationships uh \nautomatically uh right as opposed to \nmanual definition \nI think \num yeah I'm I'm very excited to see \nwhere this goes \num I think they're they're uh uh like \njust a kind of like with a grain of salt \nthere are some practical considerations \njust because you know um it is I think \nimportant to Define some uh performance \nbar right over like what is the \nacceptable level of quality that you're \nlooking for like for instance if you're \ndata and dress pipeline using GPT is \nactually you know making mistakes like \n10 of the time like that might be too \nhigh right and and then the question is \nthinking about how can you think about \nsome interface where you know maybe it's \nnot automating all of it there's still \nsome like human feedback in the loop but \nit's automating like a good chunk of it \nright and and and then it can actually \nhelp Empower and speed up like users \nworkflows and actually building out some \nof these pipelines so uh a similar \nanalogy to this is you know why for \ninstance something like copilot or \nnotion AI are popular because they allow \nfor mistakes uh made uh by the model \nright and so you do want to probably put \nthis as some interface where you can \nstill allow the model to make some \nmistakes because you know the model is \ngreat but it's not perfect it makes a \nlot of mistakes uh and and so \num how can you make sure that the errors \ndon't propagate and that you can kind of \ncorrect errors right now I think that's \na gonna be an interesting interface to \nthink about and probably something I'm \nthinking about for for GPC index as well \nand the hope is as these models get \nbetter you're going to have to do a \nlittle bit less of that yeah I have one \nmore follow-up question about that \nbecause it's so interesting so if we if \nwe switch gears a little bit from you \nworking on GPT index more as likely you \nknow the the the the the project you \nalso need to design it right so you're \ndesigning like the the interface how \npeople interact with it \num what so what kind of things are you \ntaking considerations for those who want \nto use stupid index really to to build \nlike production social right so are you \nare you taking it into consideration \nright now or like no no I'm just parking \nthat that's just you know first things \nfirst and then do that later or I would \nlove to learn how you how are you \nthinking about that \num I think \nI think um uh \nI'm somewhat parking that and the reason \nis because I haven't dove into the uh \nfull brainstorming about how to really \nsolve like uh how to automate like data \ningestion and transformation I imagine \nonce I really start thinking about that \nthen the notion of you know how to \nevaluate performance and how do I uh \ncorrect errors those types of things \nwould become more important I find that \nfor the basic use case that a lot of \npeople are using right now for GT index \nbecause the construction of the index is \nstill kind of manually determined by the \nuser uh a lot of the end use cases are \nfor instance for like summarization and \nsearch and for a lot of the current use \ncases uh it's actually okay to make some \nerrors right like you know your people \nuse like recommendation models ml models \nand search all the time and you know uh \npart of the appeal right now is you can \nactually just do search and build that \ntype of tool a lot faster with something \nlike ubt very interesting very cool and \nfor those listening to this podcast who \nare responsible for building and serving \nthese models you all know what to do you \nknow we need some we need some speed \nyeah I had one question I want to jump \nin on the correcting the errors um so \none thing that I've been thinking about \nis like with the cost like you you might \ninstead of using DaVinci 3 you might use \nlike Ada or something to have like \nbecause it's cheaper and then you can \nsample like 100 outputs and then re-rank \nthem with these ranking models uh so so \nwhat do you think about that kind of \nidea where you use a lower capacity gbt \nbut then you generate a ton of outputs \nand then filter re-rank the outputs \nyeah I mean I think there uh there's a \nlot of approaches to dealing with that \nright now um I haven't uh been able to \nexplore this fully but I think that um \nat a high level the idea of say building \nsome optimization layer that can have a \nreliable estimate of performance uh uh \nbut also give you you know like uh \npredict the the cost and uh that \nsatisfies your compute Budget Building \nthe optimization layer is absolutely \nsomething I want to start working on and \nso whether or not that includes for \ninstance using like cheaper models and \nstacking it with like uh better models \nright uh or whether that's a notion of \njust like how do I try the best to like \nevaluate latency and how do I speed that \nup right with respect to for instance \nlike async operations or \num or other techniques those are all in \nconsideration for this idea of \noptimization because I think right now \nthere's like a lot of there's like a \ngrab bag of different techniques that \npeople can use to try to uh like both \nmake things a little bit cheaper and \nalso a little bit faster \num ideally what I'd want to do is \nprovide an interface and make that as \naccessible as possible and also adopt a \nlot as these models get better because \nuh you know that is some of these \ntechniques might become out of date as \nthese models get better like uh a class \nI mean one of the examples is is the \nopen AI embedding like before like open \nair release like tax and betting data uh \nright like zero zero two uh like it was \njust infusible to actually use open AI \nembeddings like I I ran up a 20 Bill \ngoing through like uh like two or three \ndocuments uh and then all of a sudden \nwith these embeddings are like 99.98 \ncheaper it's just a lot more feasible to \nuse this to index a lot of documents so \nI think um we do want to make this uh \nprovide some general tooling to to help \npeople decide between cost and latency \nand we also want to adapt this tool to \nFuture advances \nhow much are you are you connected to to \ngbt models right because it's in the \nname right it's a DVD index but uh you \nknow you you know a lot is happening \nthere so is that just uh it are you are \nyou like you know married to gbt models \nor are you just open to also explore \nother things \nyou know Bob that's actually a great \nquestion because you know I'm going to \nuse this opportunity to say that we are \nactually going to undergo a name change \nuh probably you know within the next few \nweeks it'll be gradual you know we'll \nsupport some sort of backwards \ncompatibility with this package of GPT \nindex \num that everyone's familiar with \num but uh yeah so we are very much \num uh trying to trying to I mean the \ntool itself is already General but we're \ntrying to also position it as more \nGeneral \num uh already like you know GPT Index \nright now supports different lens \nbesides just open AI models itself right \nyou can plug in \num basically any sort of llm from \nplugging face cohero 21 other model \nproviders and you can also plug in \ndifferent types of them adding models as \nwell we do want to be a general tooling \nlayer on top of like different uh llms \nright as opposed to being tied to a \nspecific service also you know changing \nthe name and and more General will help \nus avoid some trademark issues so uh \nvery excited to start uh kind of keeping \nyou posted on some updates for this so \nso are you are you going to keep us \nwaiting or can you already share what \nthe name will be \nyou know I um I we \nI will give you a hint in that we \nreleased a llama Hub about two days ago \nor yesterday and we like llama as a \nprefix and I think that's what I'll say \nthere okay okay that's that's fine \nthat's fine that's that's we can work \nwith that thanks for sharing yeah that's \ngreat because llm it's too like you know \nthere's no vowels in the middle of it no \nexactly yeah I I love the name I think \nthat'd be a great thing if we could talk \na little more about llama Hub uh so I \nhad a quick look at it it's like a hub \nfor external data sources tell me more \nabout it yeah exactly so \num maybe to frame this a little bit \nbetter you know part of GBC Index right \nnow is the way you can Define complex \nrelationships over your data but really \nthe higher level mission is again to \nDefine this best interface of your data \nright and one thing that we've been \nnoticing especially as people have been \nstarting to use GPC index is that \nit has this entire \num pipeline has a potential to kind of \nalter the data analytics landscape like \nif you think about just the amount of \nwork it takes to address data right and \nthe data engineering pipelines in place \nto address transform you know store data \nand then you know transfer transform \nthose into insights that you get to the \nend user there's like multiple companies \nand you know billions of dollars within \neach of these components right so \nwithin like five lines of code within \nGPT Index right now right you can \nbasically build a Search bot you can \naddress your PDFs right convert it into \nsome text and the beauty about gbt is \nthat you don't have to make that text \nsuper structured you just need to \nprovide some information about it and \nthen the worries that you have are more \nabout like text trunking and how to \nactually provide this information and \nthen you store it you know in some \nformat whether you know it's uh \nalleviate uh or or some more structured \ndatabase and then you just ask gbt to \nfor to answer questions right and then \nGPT can handle \nknow translation to SQL or just directly \nusing the the raw question to answer \nanswer \num your query so there's just a lot of \nkind of interesting things happening \naround this idea that I think \num if once llms do take off this entire \npipeline will be able to change uh and \nand actually become kind of like a lot \nsimpler and and just uh more automated \nand one of the key components at the \nbeginning of this is this idea of data \ningression right and so \num I think one thing that's been really \ncool a really cool component of GT index \nso far is we've seen users submit a lot \nof community built data loaders uh from \nPDFs so for instance uh HTML documents \nto PowerPoints \num to web pages and apis with pretty \nmuch a lot of the popular Integrations \nlike Notions slack Discord uh we have a \nGitHub integration coming soon as well \nand it it's really the thing is it's \nactually not super hard for users to add \nthese Integrations because you know what \nthey have to be worried about is just \nnot like doing all the ETL into a \nstructured database they just call or \nconnect to this API and they provide the \ninformation as raw text maybe with some \nannotations on top right and then the \nquestion is just okay now how can you \nfeed this into something like 3pt index \nbut can which can address this raw text \nand do Tech splitting and and you know \nstore it into an index data structure \nsorry yeah so if you look at the um if \nyou look at the at the uh the the sulfur \nstick right so where you have the user \non top and then core infrastructure on \nat the bottom right so and so you have \nthe whole stack and then for example so \nso we've hit is a bit lower because it's \nlike a database and then GP Linux a \nlittle bit above that closer to the to \nthe user \ndo you think that GPT index would evolve \nalso more like up the stack so because I \nwas very intrigued what you said about \nlike also all these these data loaders \nthat people are introducing \num that is interesting because that \nwould allow you to have like this whole \nyou know uh \num you know Marketplace basically of \ndata loaders \num or are you more interested in moving \ndown the stack how do you see that \ndevelop \nuh it's a good question I \nI don't really see myself or Jupiter \nnext moving \num down the stack anymore right uh at \nleast at the current moment because you \nknow like we V8 knows you guys know how \nto create like scalable like high \nperformance like databases right and and \nuh part of gbt indexes appeal is \nactually just being able to integrate \nwith uh for instance you guys to \nactually uh help users build an app \nright for uh uh on top of their data \num I could see us expanding both \nhorizontally and and maybe a little bit \nuh kind of up the stack as well I think \ndata ingression is one of those pieces \nthat \num very much is that fits within this \nphilosophy because you know we we build \nthis Marketplace um or this community \nit's not really a Marketplace but like a \nCommunity Driven Hub of uh people trying \nto submit and then you know just \nsubmitting \num different types of parsers and \nloaders for different different types of \napplications we can try to have them use \nGPT index with this data loader or you \nknow you can actually use this with Lane \ntrain as well and what it actually does \na few things one is you know we provide \nthe central platform for them to then \naddress this data then you know what \nwhatever the storage and kind of like \num uh of this data is it could you know \nvery well be weeviate and then \num the other component of this is that \nby kind of \num creating this community of data \nloaders we can help almost like educate \nusers on the value of outlands because \nbecause now you know you can actually \nhave people thinking hey like it's not \nlike I only need to just feed in my text \nnotes right it actually turns out like \nwith Technologies like not even just a \ngbt or llms like by combining stuff like \nwhisper or like image captioning models \nor any sort of you know uh models that \nbasically convert unstructured data into \ntext we can actually build this \nend-to-end application starting from \nthis very unstructured data into \nsomething that you can actually \ntranslate into insights so I think that \nthat is uh very much something that is \npart of our vision and I think the first \npart of that is super important as well \nyeah well I I think um well I think \nthat's a good coverage of the topic so \nif there's anything else you guys want \nto add I I mean you shouldn't offer that \nbecause I can keep talking for two more \nhours about this so it's like this is \njust too exciting stuff man too exciting \nyeah well maybe I I want to throw this \nin quickly before we wrap it up is um \nlike how about the extension from text \nimages and multimodal I just love this \ntopic because I think we're yeah so we \nsaw the diffusion models and I think a \nlot of us predict that you know we're \nheaded towards this boom and and uh \nimage uh image audio video 3D images all \nthat yeah 100 I mean I think \num I'm still kind of trying to \nbrainstorm use cases let's say for text \nto image like what that would look like \nand you know this is just me spitballing \noff the top of my head is it like oh you \nwant to be able to reference like a \ncorporates of existing data that's also \nimages that you could generate a new \nimage is that that you want to be able \nto reference a corpus of text \ndescription so you can generate a new \nimage I'm definitely open to the \npossibility \num at least in terms of including some \ncomponents of that I will say though in \nterms of like storage or or \nconverting from like say images and \naudio to text that's actually part of \nthis idea of llama Hub and actually \nsomething that we we want to push for \nimagine if you can just you know take in \nsome different types of uh data right \nthat are not inherently taxed on their \nown but you can convert them into a text \nformat that makes it pretty easy to \nsearch and look up without doing too \nmuch data engineering on your side I \nthink that could be a pretty valuable \napplication \nyeah it's incredible do you see like \nmaybe even like brain computer \ninterfaces like that kind of data being \ntranslated and GPT index going through \nyour brain scans yeah no I mean I think \nyou know a lot of the heavy lifting is \ndone by these models that are are doing \nthese conversions and and we're very \nexcited to keep tabs on the advances \nlike for instance we integrate like open \nair whisper we open it uh integrate like \nthe donut model which does like uh kind \nof OCR uh we're very excited to try to \ninclude this and now the question is how \ncan we uh you know wrap this in a layer \nthat \num makes it both easy for people to \nbuild apps on top of it and then two uh \nmake this uh scalable and perform it \nright because you know some of these \nmodels do have GPU and performance \ninstruments yeah and one more as I'm \nlike doing this list what about robotics \nlike uh have you seen the the say can uh \nlike kind of how much these advances in \ntext processing are impacting the \nrobotics generalization as well \nyeah that's interesting I mean I kind of \num came from a world of self-driving \nresearch before \num uh my current role uh and this is a \nfew years ago and I think so far you \nknow I think it's been \num somewhat decoupled like I think you \nyou'd store for instance like image and \nand lidar data as uh you know uh \nembeddings on its own you don't really \nthink about like converting it to text \nuh so I think you know for practical \nreasons there's probably ways to just \nlike store different types of data in \ntheir own formats \num but if you know we start to see these \nmodels become just again faster cheaper \nand better like I could see text being a \nbit more Universal of the interface for \nstorage and then and then you know then \nif you're filled a bunch of applications \non office \nyeah incredible well Jerry and Bob thank \nyou so much for coming on the weba \npodcast and for having this discussion I \nsaw Bob recently shared a meme where \nit's uh Patrick from SpongeBob his head \nis exploding and that's \nthat's how I felt this whole time and I \nthink this is just such an information \nheavy uh podcast I think this sub index \ntool use this routing thing is just one \nof the most exciting emerging \nTechnologies and we're so grateful to \nhave you on the podcast so thank you so \nmuch \nyeah fantastic thank you \namazing thanks a lot and thanks Connor \n", "type": "Video", "name": "GPT Index and Weaviate with Jerry Liu and Bob van
