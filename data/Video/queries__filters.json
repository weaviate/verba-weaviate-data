{"text": "Weaviate Academy Unit 2: Filters. \nhey and welcome back in this section we'll introduce you to filters in waviite filters can help you to restrict your vector searches to the parts of the data set that you're interested in for example you might have a class that contains texts from multiple categories of books in this case if you want to restrict your vector search to a particular category such as history you can use a filter to do just that it might be the same if you're looking for posts by a particular user or those from a specific channel in a series of posts in multiple channels in other words filters can really help you to focus in with your vector searches to the parts of the data set that you're interested in some of the most commonly used filters include where limit and offset these filters can be applied to your queries to modify the results based on specific criteria making them more targeted and meaningful the web filter is similar to the where clause in a SQL query allowing it to apply a Boolean condition the data it can be used with different operators such as like greater than less than and many more you can even use multiple conditions within a wear filter to further refine your query results this can seem complex at first but if you think of them as simply combinations of individual wear filters they'll seem a lot more manageable now let's discuss the limit and offset filters you've seen the limit filter already a number of times it restricts the maximum number of objects to be retrieved while the offset filter is used to skip a certain number of results these two filters are often used together allowing you to paginate a long result set to multiple sets of results for example to display multiple pages of 20 results per page you can set limit to 20 and increase your offset by 20 at a time starting with zero so the first page would have an offset of zero the second page would have offset of 20 and so on and so forth this is a common technique that will help you to prevent having to fetch all proceeding results to create page Nation filters are very powerful tools that can help you to refine your query results in waviate they allow you to combine the flexibility of vector searches with the Precision of Boolean filters to only zero in uncertain parts of your data set that you're interested in that's it for this section on filters in waviate thanks for watching and we'll see you soon ", "type": "Video", "name": "queries__filters", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ouOpwdbMQg", "timestamp": "", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
