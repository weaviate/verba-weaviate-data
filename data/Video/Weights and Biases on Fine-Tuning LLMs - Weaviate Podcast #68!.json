{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the 68th episode of the Weaviate Podcast! We are super excited to welcome ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nchecking out another episode of the \nwevia podcast featuring Morgan Derek and \nThomas from weights and biases this was \nsuch a fun podcast diving into all \nthings deep learning model training but \nparticularly these days training large \nlanguage models has been so exciting \nwe've recently completed the weviate \ngorilla project where we fine-tuned \nllama 7B using hug and faces peft \nLibrary exploring sparse fine-tuning and \nall these exciting things so in this \npodcast we dive all into the current \nstate of the tooling around fine tuning \nor you know maybe training a large \nlanguage model from scratch which was \nshown to you on the screen right now and \nwe also discussed things like why you \nwould want to fine-tune a language model \nsay the difference between Rag and \nfine-tuning and how these are actually \ncomplementary Technologies as well as \nthat General kind of idea like domain \nspecific fine tuning that's been around \nforever or this kind of task specific \ndistillation like you only need your \nlanguage model to perform summarization \nquestion answering or formatting API \nrequests so really quickly before diving \nin I wanted to hide like this awesome \nnew project from waste and biases \ntraining tiny llamas for fun and science \nif you've seen the weights and biases \nreproduction of Dolly with Dolly mini \nit's kind of similar in spirit to that \nwhere it shows the weights and biases \nreports going through different details \nof the uh the Llama architecture so \nthere are more details in here that I \npersonally know about but you can see \nfrom here hopefully it'll ground the \ncontext for our conversation a little \nbit how weights and biases it helps you \nexplore these different configurations \nfor training so you know sometimes that \nis super in the details like you know \nsay you have these hyper parameters like \nsoftmax has some normalization parameter \nand it takes on this particular value \nthis has been a lot of the kind of hyper \nparameter tuning and that's a you know a \nwhole box to open as well so I hope you \nenjoy the podcast I had so much fun you \nknow meeting and talking with Derek \nThomas and Morgan so with that said \nlet's get into it hey everyone thank you \nso much for watching another episode of \nthe weeviate podcast I'm super excited \nto welcome Morgan \nand Thomas cappell from weights and \nbiases is going to be such a fun \ndiscussion I've been having so much fun \nexploring the space of large language \nmodel fine tuning of course I've been \naware of weights and biases for a super \nlong time and so you know finally \nteaming up and doing something like this \nis so exciting guys thank you so much \nfor joining the podcast \nthanks for the invitation Hannah thank \nyou \nawesome so maybe could we do a quick \nlike a quick round to kick things off of \nhow we're currently thinking about uh \nllm fine-tuning such an exciting topic \nand weights and biases is such an \nawesome tool for doing this \nyeah hello everyone I'm Thomas \num machine learning engineer at weights \nand biases \num yeah what we see from from the open \nsource community and from Enterprise \ncustomers is that everyone is loving and \nusing weights and biases to to follow \ntheir experiments the metrics and the \ntraining logs and keeping everything \ntight \num I have been mostly following the the \nopen source Community because they have \nbeen doing like crazy experiments uh \ninviting people to participate and we \nsee that yeah most of the repos out \nthere already are baked in with weights \nand biases and as simple as like turning \nit on and they are sharing those \ndashboards and people are commenting and \nyou can you can see those training loss \nGoing Down live it's pretty exciting I I \nthink I just just adding because like \nwe're talking about fine-tuning color \nlamps but uh I think it's important to \nsay like what what we actually mean by \nan llm are we talking about like a 70 \nbillion uh decoder model like Llama Or \nGPT 3.5 like we've been fine-tuning but \nlike models encoders for like ages and I \nthink that's still going on I think the \nquestion like since uh chat GPT or PR \nsince we have like these huge models \nthat actually perform zero shot and a \nfew shots like reasonably well like do \nwe want to fine-tune this type of models \nand I think this is like what we are \ntrying to learn as a community kind of \nlike what works actually which use cases \nwe want to fine-tune these models versus \njust going zero shot \nyeah yeah the other thing I'm like \num \nreally interested in seeing is like the \nnumber of \nsoftware Engineers you know who got \npulled in back in like October November \nwith like 3.5 and then gbd4 and then \nlike gamma 2 who are now like into \nfine-tuning or comments like figure out \nhow to fine-tune without like an ml \nbackground and that's really interesting \nto see like a lot of the like the \ntraining scripts and Frameworks that \nlike \nkind of like you know will probably get \nyou like quite a good results without \ntoo much ml knowledge like that's \nprobably the last 10 percent that we \nspend some time with it but that's kind \nof cool to see for me as well \nyeah I think that the open source \nCommunity I was mentioning is it's \npacked with people like this like they \ndon't come from the traditional ml \nbackground and they are yeah pulling \nthose scripts and creating data sets \nfrom merging all the data sets or just \nusing it made more data and then \nlaunching those fine tunes and expecting \nto get good results sometimes breaking \nstuff it's pretty exciting \num amazing there's so many cool things \nin that I love uh Thomas what you said \nin the introduction about kind of the \nexperiment tracking and sharing your \nlearning curves with people and Derek I \nlike how you broke down the um uh sorry \nthe um the the different categories of \nmodels to training like LMS as well as \nmaybe embedding models or cross encoders \nyou know extractive QA in our search \nWorld of thinking and Morgan I really \nlike that um like just thinking about uh \nthe abstractions around how uh how easy \nfine-tuning is becoming and how all \nthese software developers who maybe the \nway that I see it is I think the zero \nshot models like we mentioned you know \nChad gbt or like even zero shot \nembedding models that's like really \nevangelize this for software engineers \nand now tools like weights and biases I \nthink hugging face has done an \nincredible job with their abstractions \naround training kit can maybe talk a \nlittle more about \num yeah like the current state of the \ntooling for llm find and we can talk \nabout other models too but I think llm \nfine tuning is just super exciting and \nlike kind of the tooling for it in your \nexperience with it there's a lot of code \nbase out there \num most of them build on top of hugging \nface Transformers library but with their \nown like saws and colors and and putting \neverything into yamls or or yeah or or \nusing structures on like then like \nrefactoring this into like a super \nsimple script \num we are still not with a proven best \nof flops per second whatever script that \nmakes everything work but there are \nplenty of bushes out there from lead \nllama from Axolotl using paths or like \nthe hugging phase even hugging face has \nmultiple libraries on top of Transformer \nthat would let you like fine-tune \nefficiently and yeah and we have this \nGPU shorter so like you cannot fit \nwhatever model you want like you need to \nmake some tricks to \nso like efficiently Trim in some \nparameters another full model and yeah I \ndon't know the tooling is still evolving \nsuper fast and people are breaking \nbreaking the code bases regularly and \nI'm I'm actually running right now some \nsome fine-tuning windows and \nand yeah I suppose that as Morgan said \nlike the silver Engineers out there are \nnot afraid of like launching a Docker \ncontainer and just like executing stuff \nlike that us machine Engineers that come \nfrom Academia or research are like maybe \nthose tools are more frightening to us \nand \nmaybe this will be beneficial for \neveryone we'll have better software \nengineering practice baked into this \nmachine learning \num \nyeah I don't know Cal also \nyeah that's awesome yeah I I think that \nthat pep Library the way they've \nabstracted the sparse fine-tuning with \nlike Laura and I think there are other \ntechnique that's all really impressive \nand yeah so we'll definitely come back \ninto the tooling can we talk about I \nreally want to get your perspective on \nuh like you know why fine tune a large \nlanguage model generally like um I kind \nof see two schools of thought where it's \nlike we saw this wave before you know \nthe most recent kind of thing where it \nwould be like uh biomed Bert or like Kem \nBert and the idea was basically you take \nthe same gbt Uber algorithm and you just \ndomain specific training data and you \nknow that's what you're going to need to \nhave a language model reason about your \nparticular kind of stuff and then \nthere's also kind of \num like Morgan I saw you do some \nexperiments with the gorilla things and \nit's like kind of the the distillation \nof LMS into task specific models so it's \nlike that's kind of how I see why would \nyou want to fine tune is either or you \nhave this kind of more classic way of \nthinking where it's like you need to \ndomain at adapt it to your thing or \nyou're like trying to distill language \nmodel that does like all these tasks \ninto one specific kind of task \nyeah I think there's a maybe a third \ncategory there as well as that \nopen AI seem to be pushing with their \n3.5 fine tuning which is just around \nlike style like just \num you know speaking you know you know \nmore with like your company's voice and \nlike a support agent spotter or you know \nusing yeah maybe using the right like \ndifferent terminology \num which was like interesting to see for \nopen air question and also kind of a \nlittle disappointing because obviously \nthe \num potential of fine-tuning riders \naround like instantly new knowledge into \nyour model and they they seem to like \nde-emphasize that a little bit with at \nleast a 3.5 fine tuning they're more \nlike you know don't worry about it knows \neverything it needs no just like it'll \ntweak the style but but yeah like with \nthe gorilla \num fine-tuning I did \num to make a task specific like it did \nyou know I did like learn new knowledge \nthere so like I think it is possible but \nyou know maybe they didn't want to like \nmake any crazy claims about how good \nthat that could be \num hmm \nyeah that's so interesting I mean the um \nlike we're obviously quite bullish you \nknow we V8 Vector database on the whole \nretrieval augmented generation and \nthat's like you know that we love that \nand so it's like the um the have it \nlearn new knowledge is kind of like um I \nguess there's like this entanglement \nwhere it's like you think of the llm as \nlike the reasoning engine and you just \nkind of pack enough information in it \nand it'll figure it out especially as we \nimagine the trends seem to be headed \ntowards really long context models you \nknow we can imagine maybe that lost in \nthe middle thing is kind of alleviated \nwith some retriever aware tuning and you \nknow and then we imagine just the next \niteration of gbt5 where it's more \ntraining data or you know however the \nnew advances and so I I'm kind of always \nthinking about like retrieval augments a \ngeneration and then this you know style \nyou mentioned or skill like an example \nwe had on the last podcast was like \nyou're a lawyer right and if I'm your \nlawyer I could have the best contacts \never I could have all the perf laws to \nmake your case but you're still probably \ngoing to jail because I don't know how \nto reason across the things whereas \nthat's I really like that kind of \nperspective of you know how how do you \nguys see rag versus Ln fine tuning \nI think if if I can take it I I feel \nlike like rock is definitely staying \nthere in terms of like being a knowledge \nbase like I don't think we ever want to \ndepend on llams as knowledge basis \nbecause that's that's not what they are \ndesigned for like we definitely see llms \nas a as a reasoning engine over the \nknowledge you get from from the rag and \nuh going back to this fine-tuning \nquestion I I feel like in the beginning \nlike when you're exploring a new use \ncase it makes sense to to start with \nlike zero shot gpt4 combined with drag \nbut once you get more mature especially \nas you want to scale you know imagine \nyou're like a big e-commerce and you \nsort of like millions of requests like \nlike gpt4 may not be feasible at this at \nthis scale and then you need to figure \nout okay I have like a very compelling \nuse case and I want to solve it at scale \nlike at a reasonable cost like I need to \nfigure out some alternative solution and \nthen maybe that's a that's a case for \nfor fine tuning but yeah it's it's \nexactly that I'm also I will add that if \nyou start with a 0 shot model like from \nopen AI or a vendor then you can collect \ndata to afterwards fine-tune your mall \nwith the good answers like from from \nfrom your retrieval so it's like maybe a \ntwo-step process \nyeah I I love that you brought that up \nbecause yeah that's what we're seeing a \nlot of is people get output responses \nfrom gbt4 and then they're using the new \nthree-point gbt 3.5 fine tuning API to \nyou know gbt4 compress it to 3.5 and I \nyou know especially as machine learning \npeople I think you know that knowledge \ndistillation idea where you can compress \nthe models by copying the output of the \nlarge models how do you guys think about \nthat like knowledge distillation it \nshould be like a you know a gold mine \nfor compressing the models and then \nmaking inference cheaper and all that \ngood stuff \nyeah I think it still hit the um \nlike you you probably still want to like \nhave access to like a knowledge base and \na ground truth there at least until like \nsomeone figures out hallucination \nbecause it's the smaller like distilled \nmodel or still \num you know it still will be prone like \nto the same \nissues \num there was I think I can recall now \nbut some paper that's showing that like \ndistilled models \num \nyou know do do really good at like the \num \nuh on like certain benchmarks um and on \nthe like bulk of the data set but like \nreally struggle and fail on the outline \nand those areas only account for like \nyou know point five percent or a percent \non a benchmark so it's fine it doesn't \nmatter but you know in the real world \nlike out of distribution data sets like \nthat you know that might be happier \nyeah yeah so they're like Distillery \ndistillation one is like \nreally interesting I wonder kind of but \nyou know go like like Derek said it's \nall you \num \nyou definitely want to like move to like \nsmaller faster cheaper models and I'm \nkind of curious if someone will figure \nout how to \ndistill like not yet like not the the \nknowledge but like a subset of like the \nreasoning ability like say like yeah \nyou're an e-commerce site like it \ndoesn't need to know \num how to like reason over like medical \ndiagnosis or something like that yeah \nyes this product customer you know did \nthese things and might want this \nrecommendation or something or this text \num like \nyeah that's what I love about that's why \nI really love how um you know um Morgan \nyou and I are both working on the \ngorilla project and it gives us some \nkind of thing to ground this with I \nthink our discussion and like you know \nlike so with my experiments with Gorilla \nI'm I'm currently using the Llama 7 \nbillion parameter model and it's exactly \nthis is like um I have some specific \nthing I don't need it to reason about \nmedical conversations as you mentioned \nthat's not useful for this so it's like \nthat kind of I just find that example of \nyou know learning to format API request \na couple reasons I like it so much is \nobviously for one it helps like us \nground our conversations in LM \nfine-tuning and compressing other models \nbut I also think generally people will \nfind this pretty interesting like if you \nhave a domain specific language you know \napis you know weights and biases has \napis we get has apis and it's like you \nknow your software company probably has \napis so it's like I feel like this \nparticular fine tuning task of \ninterfacing the LMS with your software \nis quite uh generally appealing yeah \nmaybe be a great thing to just openly \nsay Morgan what Drew your interest to \nthe gorilla project \num \nyeah it's a good question I remember \nwhen it came out and I like I thought it \nwas super cool I know I think it was \npretty \nopen AI functions right \num so like yeah get getting like \nstructured outposts the call apis \num by the way can you explain gorilla \nfor for folks that may not be familiar \nwith this data set \noh yeah I'll give a quick tldr the the \noriginal paper from Berkeley is um they \ncreated a data set of of deep learning \nmodel apis so they took models from \nhugging face Hub torch Hub and \ntensorflow hub and then they would you \nknow so you have like image segmentation \nmodels image generation models or maybe \nuh text classification models \nand then you use self-instruct prompting \nwhere you have gbt4 write an instruction \na natural language instruction for when \nsomeone would want to use the particular \nmodel so then you um retrieve so then at \ninference and then you train the model \nto write the API requests for the \ndifferent hugging face models and then \nat inference time you retrie you take a \nnatural command like I want to see cats \ndancing in celebration and then you \nretrieve the API reference using \nretrieval to get like the hugging face \nuh image generation you know the API \nreference and then it formats the \nrequest to instantiate the hug and face \nmodel and so then with weavi we uh it's \na natural command of like uh you know \nsearch through podcast clips that \ndiscuss llms in Search and it formats \nthe graphql and then it hits the vector \nsearch database and then gives you your \nsearch results so that's kind of the \nextension from the original paper to \neviate and you know with weights and \nbiases I imagine like you could you \ncould have a natural language like \nwhat's the status of my training run \nright and or like my training runs how \nis back size impact impacting my loss \nand then it and then it would format the \nweights and biases apis and then do the \nthing for you \nexactly \num \nyeah sorry so gorilla why yeah so that \nwas the um I was curious when the paper \ncame out and then but didn't didn't pick \nit up then and then yeah 3.5 fine tuning \narrived and yeah I just wanted to like I \nkind of remembered that was the thing \nand I was like yeah can we kind of \nimitate functions a little bit with 3.5 \num \nyeah that's the main priority and then \nit was like pleasantly surprised if the \nresults as well I think it was pretty \ncool \num but then like going to Step Beyond it \nlike like you have and like fine tune in \nsome of the smaller \nopen source llms is uh yeah really the \ninteresting things there because if you \ncan get them to give you like consistent \nlike API outputs \num that's like yeah pretty special \nyeah I think it's really cool because uh \nlike weights and biases well yeah okay \nso I see I I definitely want to talk \nmore about how weights and biases and \nopenai fine tuning play together I've \nalways found that integration to be \npretty interesting but yeah I have the \nopen source models I I do really like \nthis topic because I've always thought \nof like weights and biases and hugging \nfaces being kind of like neighboring \nthings where it's like this like \npopulation of all these models we like \nyou know hug and face brain themselves \nis the the GitHub of machine learning \nwhere and then weights and bias is like \nthat layer where it's like well how's \ntraining the models going right and so I \nthat kind of Open Source models maybe if \nwe could maybe we could come back to the \nopen Ai and weights and biases fine \ntuning and talk more about Open Source \nllms how you see the vision of you know \nI think we have Falcon 180b on one hand \nof like we're getting these big capable \nones and then we've got like uh Phi 1.5 \nwhich I think is like an extension of \nthat tiny stories paper where they're \nsaying how small can we make them and \nthey're also like able but talk to us \nand then of course we have like llama uh \ncode llama I think deci coder is an \ninteresting model as well but yeah like \num how are you seeing that proliferation \nof Open Source Lums and at times has \nbeen playing around with some tiny \nllamas he could maybe chat about that \nyeah I can I can I can say one or two \nthings \num yeah you have like this \nthere are basically uh a bunch of \nTransformer layers stacked on top of \neach other and they have some slightly \ndifference and \nand yeah you may they are not \ninterchangeable so yeah and we don't \nactually know the datasets where they \nwere trained on \nso yeah every mall has their own like \ncapabilities and I don't think we have \ntested them \ntruly so to us as the actual performance \nI was discussing the yesterday actually \nwe with one \none person that worked on Falcon and he \nwas saying that yeah why you prefer \nllama \nwith yeah versus Falcon I was like okay \nI don't know I feel llama has but from \nwhat I have tried llama work better and \nhe was like yeah but have you tried \nspeaking in another language to Lama and \nhe I was like no I haven't and yeah \nFalcon speaks pretty well all the \nlanguages and llama doesn't so they are \ndifferences and probably if you're gonna \nfind tuna Mall you will have to actually \ndeep dive on those difference to choose \nthe good backbone to start your fine \ntuning depending on the task you are you \nare going to try to solve on your \ncompany data on your corporate \nenvironment so I haven't asked myself a \nquestion I was like looking at those \nokay they all look basically the same \nall of them have flash attention \nsome of them are like saving some \ncompute on the projections or not but \nthey are not trained on the same data \nand \nthat's also the open source part where \npeople are trying to build those open \nsource data sets so we know exactly on \nwhat are they train on \nbut even if they are using open source \ndata \nwe realize afterwards that they are \ntraining on the test data sets \nafterwards like oh they you cut like the \nuh someone was busting on Twitter \nyesterday I would like to take the \nquestion you cut half and the model \ncompletes the rest so basically even if \nthe data set I open source they are so \nbig they are now we are not even capable \nto know what's in there \nso yeah there's a trade-off of exploring \nwhat's out there on the data sets and \narchitecture-wise they are not that \ndifferent so \nyeah I just wanted to make that point \nabout that \nwe need to explore them way more than \nwhat we're doing now that the benchmarks \nare not \ndeep enough to exploit those \nwho will need some goggle like hidden \ndata said that \nwe know for sure that it's not leaked on \nany training data \nit's like in a storage container in \nIceland and yeah \nyou have to say the hard drive and one \nmonth later you can do it results by \npaper you know like they postal office \nyeah I mean that's an interesting point \nthough is um you know I I wonder if \npeople out there are thinking about \ntrying several different like open \nsource Foundation models to start their \nfine-tuning with like you know me \npersonally I've just llama 7B is like \nyeah yeah \ndefinitely a cool opportunity I mean I \nthink another this is another great \ntransition into I know recently uh \nyou've had Jonathan Franco giving a \nlecture series on weights and biases and \nyou know I'm Jonathan's biggest fan I'm \nwatching anything he's doing and he's \nbeen talking a lot about uh you know the \nimportance of the data cleaning and all \nthis kind of thing uh what kind of \nlessons have you been learning from from \nthe lecture series \nyeah this is uh this is a great point \nand thanks a lot to Jonathan for uh for \njoining \num our training and fine Tunica Adams \ncourse uh he just delivered a lecture on \ndata sets I think one um question that \nwe actually asked Jonathan is like um \nyou know we see two schools of thought \nlike one school of thought is like you \nneed to give a model as much data as \npossible so that's a competition like \nhow many trillions of tokens you use for \nfor pre-training of an llm and and and \nthe the premise here is like the the \nbigger the better but then on the other \nhand you also have like this textbooks \nare all you need uh small curated \nsynthetic data sets I think what I what \nat least I felt from Jonathan is he's \nmore of a Believer like more data is \nbetter \num at least \num that's what we've seen kind of like \nworked over over the longer term uh I \nthink what we can see um and maybe \nthat's that's more of my personal \nopinion but what we can see is like some \nof these models trained on smaller \nsynthetic data sets they are pretty good \non on specific benchmarks and you know \nyou can debate like the the \ncontamination aspect but I think what \nthat means is they can be made to work \npretty well on specific tasks so if you \nhave like a specific task that you want \nyour model to work really well and if \nyou have a budget to like create a \nsynthetic or or like a filtered data set \nfor that task then that's I think that's \nvery promising correction if you want \nlike a general purpose model then \nprobably the volume of data still \nmatters \nyeah that's so fascinating I mean I I \nremember from my conversations with the \nJonathan \num like kind of his journey of \nevangelizing pre-training on your data \nlike you know your company like let's \nsay your ev8 and you like concatenate \nall your blog posts all your \ndocumentation like just every text \neverything you can find that might be \nrelevant and then language model that \nand then maybe then maybe from there \nyou'd fine tune it with rlhf or distill \nit to whatever the specific task might \nbe but yeah it's such an interesting \nthing I mean this kind of synthetic data \nthing you bring up that's my experience \nwith the gorilla wevia so far is I only \nhave 2 300 synthetic examples produced \nwith self-instruct and you know by \nsplitting that into 1800 train is 500 \ntests do the math quickly but like \nthat's enough really and it seems to \nwork pretty well but I yeah I mean oh \nit's such an interesting it's kind of \nlike what that textbooks is are all you \nneed like um if your synthetic data is \nso clean follows this template maybe you \ndon't need more data whereas yeah the \nconventional wisdom and machine learning \nis go find as much data as you possibly \ncan right and yeah that's also \ninteresting I'm I'm very curious um with \nweights and biases and how you think \nabout \num data set versioning and maybe like \nthe the like fine-grained evaluation \nlike I'm training my um my like my \ngeneral biochemistry Bert and then I \nhave one subset of generalization which \nare questions about like the \nmitochondria something like this like \nhow do you think about that kind of like \nyou know the entanglement of data set uh \ndata sets the details of them maybe \nsymbolic uh identifiers on subsets of \ndata as well as monitoring training runs \nwith weights and biases \none thing so so yeah you can um version \nyour your \ndata sets in weights and biases \num but we see a lot of \ncustomers doing and it's like you know \nit's not obviously exclusive to weights \nand voices um a lot of um continuous \ntraining so they when they would uh \ncollect a lot of like production data \nsend it off to labor labelers um and \nthen \nuh augment their existing data set like \nwith a new version with their new label \ndata and then they kick off like a new \ntraining run and like that can all be \nlike automated \nwithin weights and vices which is like \nyeah it's pretty standard like \nLoop although I guess might be new to \nsome of the um software Engineers like \ncoming into the space \num \nbut yeah they they did like \nnot great devices specific but like the \nthe work um the folks that together were \ndoing with the like red pajama and um \nthe guys that normic and gpd4all where \nthey they really emphasized \num we returned to them a couple of weeks \nago on some spaces and they they really \nemphasized the um \ncurriculum aspect of their pre-training \nof their llms \nwhich I thought was super interesting \nand like obviously makes sense um and \nthey would so you know they obviously \nscoop up all of this like open source \ndata um and then like take different \nlike slices from it and then you know \nthe order of those slices essentially as \nyour model earns \num does have a big impact so there's \nkind of it was interesting that there \nwas like two aspects to it right there's \nlike the general like cleaning to remove \nlike all of the junk that's in like web \nscript data but then it's all the order \nof how you you show things \num is important and that's also \num I saw folks you know saying when they \nwere talking about \nfor even like fine tuning \num some models you \ndo you want you want to like yeah um try \nand like maybe instill some like new \nknowledge or like companies specific \num knowledge into your model but it's a \ngood idea to like throw in some of the \nyou know non-company specific \ninstruction \num instructions like data in there too \njust so it doesn't you know degrade on \nlike its General ability to like answer \nuh questions or instructions well um and \nI I thought like that was like super \ninteresting I'm sure that like people \nhave done like \nmore structured resource on it than like \nme browsing Twitter but um \nyeah there's like it's just I feel like \nit's the same thing we always keep \ncoming back to like in Emma like every \nyear it's like \nso much of it is like the data right \nit's like like amazing you almost want \nto like train and tweak new \narchitectures and play with new gpus but \nlike \ndata Maybe the data the order of the \ndata you present the model to is like \nwhatever 70 80 of the work \nyeah I can I can add something that I \nwas in a in a pan on a panel last week \nabout \nno this week about this topics and and \nand the day that the data was like \npeople were saying like hey yeah people \nthink about gpus GPU poor people GPU \nreads I need a cluster like why we don't \nget 1000 h100s and \nyeah and then someone came like yeah but \nthat's the expensive part is not that \neven if the gpus are expensive and \nrenting them like it's curating a high \nquality data set uh I don't know how how \nmuch money put openly eye on doing that \nor or Facebook or or all the like llm \ncreators but at least people seem to \nagree that it's like one or ten orders \nor two orders of magnitude higher than \nthe GPU cost of training them all \ndo you see on the on the like um Vector \ndatabase side of things like uses a \ncustomer spending a lot of time in \ncurating their their like \num yeah they're like knowledge base \nthey're like what what they're like \nputting into the vector database \nyeah I think like the the way that \npeople think about the vector database \nwell like the vector database stuff \nmostly emerges from the search engine \nstuff and in the search engine stuff \npeople think about \num adding like symbolic uh categories on \ntop of their data so you would have like \na filtered Vector search or a filtered \nhybrid search where you mix Vector \nsearch and you know bm25 scoring so so \nthat so I think people \num mostly think of there there's a lot \nof cool ideas like where people think \nabout like multi-vector representation \nlike how do I have a vector for my title \nas well as a vector for my content and \nlike in in bm25 and you know coming from \nelasticsearch and the evolution of \nsearch engines into now this newer \ngeneration it's like uh bm25f is a \npopular algorithm where you score bm25 \nfor two properties like title and \ncontent so that kind of like have a rich \nstructured data object for research \nthat's a pretty popular one there's also \nkind of like the the nested retrieval \nlike parent child hierarchy and trying \nto like search within the Childs to then \nretrieve the parents and then re-ranking \nwith the parents grouping this kind of \nthing but um in terms of the the \nlanguage modeling sent like um not too \nmany people with Vector databases have \nthis kind of like uh well yeah as I mean \nweb scraping is definitely becoming more \npopular as people are web scraping them \npopulating their Vector databases with \nthat \nespecially as um rag is evolving so yeah \nI do I do think it's something that um \nthat that are these two worlds are going \nto intersect more it's quite an \ninteresting topic I hope that answer \nhelped a bit but yeah yeah so it's like \nI guess it makes sense right that like \nthere people already starting with like \na higher quality data set to begin with \nlike like docs or you know like internal \nmaterials or customer reviews or \nsomething as opposed to yeah random \nescaped junk yeah I guess it would be \ninteresting though too \nif if people are like doing some like \nadditional processing but maybe they \ndon't need it yeah \nyeah there's maybe there may be like \nthat little like stop words removal \nstemming all that like good jazz that \ncomes with the like the NLP \npre-processing but yeah definitely \npretty structured data sets and I mean \nkind of coming back that curriculum \nlearning I love that idea it's always so \ncool when you have something that's like \nkind of human learning intuitive like \nthe idea of learn this first then learn \nthat I'm very like so with with weights \nand biases is it like \nyou can be an abstraction like you could \nyou know tweak uh I guess like um for me \ncoming into this I had done some work \nwith determined AI where we were looking \nat like um mostly like learning rate \nbatch size maybe like how many \nparameters the model is and then you \nwould do like you know the hyper \nparameter search algorithms like Asha \nhyperband or like just random search \ngrid search keeping it easy sometimes \nand and like um so can you interface \nthings like Active Learning algorithms \ncurriculum learning and weights and \nbiases is that something you've explored \nI think I think way to biasis is not \nopinionated on that like you can use any \nframework of your choice for for active \nlearning for curriculum learning like we \nmake sure to integrate easily so that \nyou can track a lot of experiments you \ncan monitor the progress like look at \nyour loss look at your metrics sample \nlike one thing that we see especially \nfor llms and like generative AI like \nsampling from the model throughout the \ntraining and looking at this samples \nbecomes like super important so like we \num we do all of the the stuff around \nlike the training so that you can get \ninsights into what's working what's not \nworking so that you can compare \nexperiments and then if you come back \nlike if you if you go on vacation and \ncome back after two weeks you understand \nwhat happened or that before that time \nso uh so this is where our our tuning \nhelps for sure but like we are not into \nlike actually like the training \nalgorithms or Frameworks that we work \nwith with python to work with tensorflow \nand all of the \nthe the different tools that you have \navailable for that \nI can I can add that I have seen like \nannotation tools integrating with us \nlike they have real Integrations to to \nuse our data lineage so they can connect \nversion data set with the model and then \nat like perform inference maybe label \nsome of the bad data on their tool and \nthen like push back that to our artifact \nsystem so it's totally doable \nyeah that's that's really exciting \nbecause I think that's maybe like \nanother opportunity for us to keep \nworking together after the podcast is \nlike um \nthey're kind of like Active Learning \nwhere you search for maybe the nearest \nneighbors to high loss points that could \nbe like one application of the \napproximate nearest neighbor surge \ntechnology and yeah that whole like \nthinking about the weights and biases \nhow it abstracts across all these \ndifferent like like uh Morgan you \nmentioned like um you know mixing the \ncurriculum or or when you're fine-tuning \nfor a particular skill like gorilla \nmixing that data with you know like um \nGeneral reasoning input output Pairs and \nso that's there's like a hyper parameter \nwith that right where like you know 32 \nminus K okay and so then you search \nthrough that um so I'm also um you know \nso with with our gorilla project I've \nbeen working with Sam selinga outside of \nweviate and so you know we've we've we \nhave this problem of like um \ncommunicating what happened and training \ntogether you know and having to \ncommunicate together and and use these \nkind of tools so that's another thing \nthat makes us really interested in \nweights and biases uh can you tell me \nmore about that kind of like you know I \nalways thought it was so cool like \npeople on Twitter would be like you know \nI have them on my phone my loss or my \ntraining curve like what's been the \nevolution of the kind of uh training \nreports prod product and like yeah \nyeah I I I don't know if you if you saw \nthe there's been a couple of screenshots \nof people looking at their charts and \nthey're like Apple watch as well \nthat's awesome \nwell you know like reports is like \na really nice tool so so it's um you can \nthink of it or just you know like a \nGoogle doc with your \num that has access to all of your logged \nweights and biases data and charts and \nyou can create new charts within it um \nas well as you know do all the text \nformatting and embed you know \nYouTube tips or tweets or like a whole \nbunch of stuff as well so it's really \npowerful \num product \num a lot of our customers \nshare it religiously either to like \nshare you know even like small bits of \nanalysis like it doesn't have to be a \nsuper polished \num report it can be like one chart and \nthree sentences um or it can be \nsomething that you know a team that's \nbeen working on a project for like three \nmonths are like sent into like Senior \nManagement to like review \num \nso super flexible like that um a little \nunderrated I I think like \num people you know need to get over \ntheir home but I can spend like you know \n10 minutes to like put something in \nthere like share it with a colleague and \nlike it's pretty amazing that like they \ncan you know the person you send it to \ncan then go in \num and modify the charts that are \nalready in there and do their own like \nyou know maybe subset of like analysis \nor like investigate like a particular \nportion of training curve or whatever \num there's the the current uh and like \nThomas knows more about this than me but \nthe current tiny llama project \num where they're like training a model \nfrom scratch exactly how is a public way \nto moist as a report \num out there at the moment and and so \nyou can watch you know their training \nloss uh drop in real time over like you \nknow they're they're training up to like \nI think three trillion tokens I think \nthey're like \nmaybe I don't think they're past a \ntrillion yet \num yeah right yeah well um like one but \nthere are about a 500 \n000 I think or sorry 500 um \nbillion \num so yeah it's like I don't know I'm a \nhuge fan of \nreports but it's like \nlike everything like within YouTube \num sometimes you have to like spend you \nknow a little bit of time with it but \nI think once like \neven to share like notes for yourself \nlike I find it super valuable like \nthere's only so much context you can \nstore in your brain and you come back to \nlike a project in like a week or a month \nor six months \nyou know you look at your workspace and \nwhat you you know knew intuitively you \ncould remember was like this was the \nbest run this one changed this on that's \nwhy that Spike happened there like all \nof that's like forgotten and if you \nhaven't documented it somewhere \num you know there's going to be a bit of \na painful like relearning so yeah \nwe did we did the experiment with Thomas \nactually a couple of months ago when \nwhen we work on the analogues course and \nthe experiment was like I start working \non a project and then I I disappeared \nand I go on vacation like whenever like \nI don't no Handover no documentation and \nthen Thomas gets to pick up the project \nlike in real life can you imagine this \nhappening like with weights and biases \nlike actually that experiment worked \npretty well like he logged into the \nproject he was able to check like what \ncode I used uh what was the result like \nwhat were the different experiments \nhyper parameters which machine I ran on \nuh what was the environment so actually \nlike Thomas you were able to pick it up \nand keep going with the project without \nlike zero Handover yeah \nI can add that tiny llama the the \nexperiment you were talking about Morgan \njust crashed like yesterday and they \nwere able to resume and the the last \nlike match perfectly \nso I was like oh good good experiment \ntracking there \nyeah wow that's amazing I mean that it's \nsuch a compelling Vision I I mean and \nalso that tiny llama project I remember \nwhen you when there was the dolly mini \nthe reproduction of that that was \namazing as well \nyeah I mean like because it's like so \nI'm curious about so so you know the \nfour of us are working on a Model \ntogether and um you know maybe Morgan \nhas a hypothesis like you know let let's \nmaybe try to prioritize training on this \nsubset of data now like like what kind \nof um \nlike intermediate questions do you \nexplore kind of like is it mostly like \num you know like like let's try this \nconfiguration of hyper parameters or is \nit like let's try to train more on this \ndata like what kind of decisions are \nbeing made over that question is \nI if I can take it like I guess \num I guess this is what would probably \nbe like uh ml training is still more and \nmore art than science like we actually \nhave a product that can do it in a \nscientific way which is sweeps and then \nand there you can like Implement like \nthe Asia search over like a range of \nhyper parameters like and then you kind \nof Let It Go but but that that explores \njust like a small subset of the \npotential improvements you can make on a \nModel because like we said like it's \nlike it's all about the data like you \ncan add data you can change the order \nyou can filter it \num there's a bunch of things you can do \nactually like on the on the code side \nyou may need to implement like a \ndifferent augmentation scheme like maybe \nthat's that's relevant for llams but uh \nyou know you can like there's a bunch of \nthings that actually require some \nimplementation \nand then this is like where um I guess \nlike like like actually you need to run \nlots of experiments and then uh like \nwhat we typically do is we we just run \nlots of experiments and then like \nlogging all of them we can compile like \nas long as you have like a good \nevaluation mechanism which is uh also \nlike a bit of an art like how to do \nevaluation properly but once you have \ngood evaluation you can then compare \nthose experiments and figure out like \nokay which of these things worked I \nguess priorities I think is um \nis also it's also a bit of an art here \nyeah well all that is so it's so amazing \nto me I mean I guess one of the so I \nhave one other question I've seen um \nhugging faces put together I think \nthey're calling it collections where you \nhave like uh like one uh repository for \nthe model the data set and the paper and \nthen I I also Imagine like the weights \nand biases sweeps adds quite a lot to \nthe scientific present like a lot of \nthese papers you know they have some \ncombination of loss functions and it's \nlike Alpha and it's like well what \nhappens is you ablate the alpha how does \nkind of sweeps fit into that picture \nwhat are your thoughts on that kind of \nlike you know trying to combine \neverything that this machine learning \npaper took into one kind of centralized \nPlace yeah we love we love the the \nmachine learning teams that use weights \nand biases because uh first like you can \nactually reproduce that research quite \neasily if if it was locked in weights \nand biases like it definitely adds \ncredibility like you can see like hey \nthis this happened for you like I can go \nahead and check the uh the training \nclass I can look at the the way \nevaluation was done so it it definitely \nlike I love research that that is done \nwith weights and biases \num I think this also helps like research \nteams be more effective \num and then in terms of documentation \nyeah we've seen some projects like \ndocuments like all of that experiments \nwith uh with with reports and and if \nthey've done if they use sweeps and in \nthe project then that also like comes \nlike with like really cool \nvisualizations and I think that that \ngives you more of a you know like a \npaper like academic paper is like a \nsnapshot and it's like a snapshot and \nthen it's like this this Iceberg where \nyou have like you know thousands of \nexperiments and then you like make a \nsnapshot of like the best one and people \nlike assuming you're a genius because \nlike you produce this you know perfectly \nworking thing but you don't see like all \nof the things that didn't work so if you \nactually \num you know if you actually courageous \nenough to to publish also like the \nresearch that did not work right that's \nI think that it's so much more valuable \nfor practitioners to see like how you \nhow you came to this uh to this piece of \nwork rather than just the the the final \nsnapshot \nhmm \nyeah it's also like that that idea of um \nyou know the four of us are training a \nmodel and uh Thomas has this hypothesis \nthat he runs off with and and we have \nthis like report of of how our thinking \nevolved and yeah it's also fascinating \num yes I think that was a really awesome \ntour of all these topics around uh \nfine-tuning let me ask you kind of this \nopen-ended question of kind of like um \nyou know what's the thing that's on the \nhorizon that that you're the most \nexcited about maybe each you could do \none \nI I guess maybe I I will start so I'm \nwell I when I first saw uh GPT 3.5 and \ngpt4 I I did not believe like open \nsource can ever catch up but I think \nlike open sources is surprising me in a \nlot of positive ways so I'm I'm looking \nforward to like see \num you know like more developments like \nmore ideas being implemented in the open \nso that we can learn from them \num that kind of like making this the \nscience accessible to to \num say the average machine learning \nengineer so I'm super excited about that \nlike experiments like this Moe uh \nmixture of experts models like I I am \nexcited how it works out \nthat's an awesome one I mean I yeah kind \nof like it it comes into like kind of \nalso talking about like um you know like \nfine-tuning it for a gorilla for some \nspecific task this the open source \nmodels are getting so good and that's so \nexciting I mean so so like this kind of \nidea of this is an I love this topic \nlike the closed Source models versus the \nopen source models for the most \ngenerally capable so you so you think uh \nor like you know like do we think that \nthe Falcon models are really catching up \nto gb24 \nor whatever the I don't know what the if \nllama is the latest state of the art or \nfalcon or yeah I think I think look at \nleast looking at the benchmarks like \nwhat like we have like like there are \ndifferent ways of evaluating from \ncompatic Models like you have the I \nthink on any Benchmark that you think \nthink of like the the classic benchmarks \nlike mlu like human eval or like the \nchat Arena like the the ELO rankings \nlike gpt4 is is winning all of them I \nthink uh and I think commercial models \nactually are on top of this this \nbenchmarks but I guess I guess more than \nlike the performance on the benchmarks I \nI think like I like the momentum that is \nin the open source and the fact that \npeople are sharing like learning new \nthings and sharing sharing them broadly \nlike that's what keeps me exciting like \nI love the like I love as as a person \nthat is fascinated by Machine learning I \nlove you know understanding kind of what \nworks what doesn't work I've seen new \nexperiments so that that keeps me \nexcited even if like they're like we're \nstill catching uh catching up like \num you know understanding like what's \nhappening is is is quite interesting \nwhat do you think about like um you know \nlike with Chad gbt being a product that \nthey're getting to have this feedback \nloop of where they they collect all this \ndata of their Model Behavior like you \ncould you know like if they let's say \nthey continue the conversation that \nmeans this is a good training example or \nsomething like that what do you think \nabout that kind of data engine that \nwould kind of fuel the closed Source \nmodels \nI I think it's pretty cool and I hope \nthey are using it \num I'm sure they're using it but other \ncompanies also have that like I suppose \nTesla could have a data engine that is \npretty complex from all the cars data \nand I remember like kapati showcasing \nthat oh this is a super complex training \nexample and we can search our immense \ndatabase and find similar ones like and \nthen active learning that and improve \nour malls and those were pretty complex \nlike \nyeah image miles connected to \nTransformer at least what they showed us \num \nso yeah that part and to add from dark \nI'm also excited about this multimodal \nstuff that's probably coming like they \nteases us with cha gpd4 \nscanning a paper and like or picture of \nyour fridge and understanding what you \ncan prepare from that \num I'm pretty sure that's gonna happen \nsoon \num \nand yeah this is super powerful yeah \nagreed I I was gonna I was gonna say two \nand like oh yeah one of one of them was \nmultimodal I think when gpd4 came out so \nI think someone in in our internal Slack \nasked like what is your like uh I think \ncontroversial opinion on like yeah ml is \ngoing this year or something and I said \nthat um \nyeah like like llms are like coming for \nthe computer vision folks I think like \nas well as the fomo like a lot of that \nCommunity are sitting pretty and we're \nlike you know not taking our jobs we \nstill needed like you still need our \nlike object detection like skills but \nlike I don't know like we say Gemini \nwe'll see like what two people can \nmanage to do \num yeah I think like llms are like \ncoming going to come harder like \ncomputer vision quicker than people \nrealize \num well I technically write it won't be \nan llm it'll be like llm plus it's some \nCB model but yeah you get dude the other \nthing I'm like \nsuper excited to see and like like to \ncontinue seeing is like the um on the \ninference side of things like actually \nlike making these work in production \num which is like no small feat and like \nthey're like gdml was like amazing like \nllm and mlc and all these like new \ninference libraries they're like our \nawesome \num you know where where \nwe're surely going to be releasing a um \nllm monitoring product to like to you \nknow like monitor all these like in \nproduction but like really \nall this training all this fine tuning \nin all this like open source energy is \ngreat but if you can't actually service \nto like real users in you know whatever \nso second so any second like latency \nlike yeah it's it's not going anyway \nright so yeah it's just that like having \nthat you know \nnow having like the entire software \ncommunity \nhelp us as in these and like not just \ntrying to figure it out \nI remember a tweet where it's like the \nmachine learning Engineers are \ndiscovering mmap and it's like this \nobvious like they're laughing at our \ninability to yeah and uh yeah that's so \nin like the what's your hot take like um \nyou know I had a friend who who posed it \nas like tell me something that's \noverrated like you have to say something \nis overrated now by the premise of the \nquestion but yeah I I love all those \ntakes those it's also interesting and \nyeah I do agree that the llm uh computer \nvid I mean that um that paper \npre-trained Transformers a universal \ncomputation engine showing you could put \nthe latent space of a computer vision \nmodel into an LM that was like you know \nI never would have thought that would \nwork but you know yeah I I it's so \nexciting I mean the gbt4 I think also \nfrom our search perspective the ability \nof that to um do like the data ingestion \nlayer where you can like visually look \nat a document and then extract the \nstructure into putting it into one of \nthese search databases that's just \nincredibly exciting for us but \nyeah Morgan Thomas Derrick this was an \nincredible podcast I learned so much \nit's been so much fun talking to you \nguys thank you so much
