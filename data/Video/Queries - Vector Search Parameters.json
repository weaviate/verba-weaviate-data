{"text": "Weaviate Academy Unit 2: Vector Search Parameters. \nhey and welcome backin this section we'll cover waviate'sVector search parameters theseparameters provide different options tohelp you retrieve the most relevantresults from waviatewebiate offers options like near Vectornear object and near text methods ormore generally near Media methods we'llgo through each of these one by one togive you a clear understanding of theirusagefirst up is the near Vector parameterwhich helps you find objects that arethe most similar to a provided vectoryou'll pass the vector which you'llrecall is just a series of numbers as anargument in your queryand wave 8 will carry out the vectorsurge to return the closest matchingobjects based on their similarityor you can use the near object parameterthis one is used to find objects similarto an existing waviate objectwith near object you specify the objectto aviate by its unique ID and waviateReturns the most similar objects basedon their Vector representationslastly we have near text or near Mediathis parameter is another powerfulSearch tool that allows you to findobjects similar to a given text inputyou'll pass the text as a conceptargument in your query and webiate willreturn objects with the high similarityto your inputnew text is one form of what we'll callmore broadly near Media parameters likenear image for image searchesthese near Media parameters follow thesame principles of returning resultsclosest to the input mediumto ensure that your vector search onlyreturns relevant results you'll need toset a thresholdyou can do this using limit or distancethresholdsyou've seen limited thresholds usedalreadythis simply sets a maximum number ofobjects to be returnedon the other hand a distance thresholdspecifies numerically how similar onobject can beat the query before it'llbe dropped from the result setthere are different ways to specify thisthreshold either as a distance or acertaintywe'll cover more on this later likedifferent metrics and how they'recalculated but the key thing to rememberfor now is that distance is a measure ofdissimilarityso lower distance is more similar whilea certainty is a measure of similarityso that a higher number means highersimilarityVector search is a core capability ofwebiate so if you understand near Vectornear object near text you'll be wellequipped to perform powerful searcheswith the right toolsthanks for watching and we'll see yousoon", "type": "Video", "name": "Queries - Vector Search Parameters", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgCSvgx9GWc", "timestamp": "", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
