{"text": "Weaviate Academy Unit 2: Vector Search Parameters. \nhey and welcome back in this section we'll cover waviate's Vector search parameters these parameters provide different options to help you retrieve the most relevant results from waviate webiate offers options like near Vector near object and near text methods or more generally near Media methods we'll go through each of these one by one to give you a clear understanding of their usage first up is the near Vector parameter which helps you find objects that are the most similar to a provided vector you'll pass the vector which you'll recall is just a series of numbers as an argument in your query and wave 8 will carry out the vector surge to return the closest matching objects based on their similarity or you can use the near object parameter this one is used to find objects similar to an existing waviate object with near object you specify the object to aviate by its unique ID and waviate Returns the most similar objects based on their Vector representations lastly we have near text or near Media this parameter is another powerful Search tool that allows you to find objects similar to a given text input you'll pass the text as a concept argument in your query and webiate will return objects with the high similarity to your input new text is one form of what we'll call more broadly near Media parameters like near image for image searches these near Media parameters follow the same principles of returning results closest to the input medium to ensure that your vector search only returns relevant results you'll need to set a threshold you can do this using limit or distance thresholds you've seen limited thresholds used already this simply sets a maximum number of objects to be returned on the other hand a distance threshold specifies numerically how similar on object can beat the query before it'll be dropped from the result set there are different ways to specify this threshold either as a distance or a certainty we'll cover more on this later like different metrics and how they're calculated but the key thing to remember for now is that distance is a measure of dissimilarity so lower distance is more similar while a certainty is a measure of similarity so that a higher number means higher similarity Vector search is a core capability of webiate so if you understand near Vector near object near text you'll be well equipped to perform powerful searches with the right tools thanks for watching and we'll see you soon ", "type": "Video", "name": "Queries - Vector Search Parameters", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgCSvgx9GWc", "timestamp": "", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
