{"text": "Hey everyone, thank you so much for watching the 50th (!!!) Weaviate Podcast with Emil Sorensen and Finn Bauer from Kapa AI! \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching the wevia podcast we have a \nsuper exciting episode I'm so excited to \nwelcome email and Finn they're building \nKappa AI Kappa AI is uh it's a super \nimpressive kind of like large language \nmodel with Vector database for your own \nuh code documentation blog post this \nkind of thing and personally it saved my \nlife we have it in our wevia chat and I \nneeded to say Hey how do I insert \nobjects one by one with JavaScript I ask \nkapha it's like I got you correct answer \nso I am so impressed with this system \nand I'm so excited to be talking to \nemail and Finn to hear about like how \nyou to think about the the evolution of \nthis space so firstly guys thank you so \nmuch for joining the podcast \nno thank you awesome thanks for inviting \nus awesome so could we kick this off \nmaybe just like with the origin story of \ncapital like how you how you came to be \nworking on this \nyeah for sure happy to give a quick \nrundown \num maybe by brief intro I'm Emil Finn \nover here we go back about six seven \nyears met while uh while doing \nUniversity initially studying Finance \nkind of looked at each other and said \nlike ah you know maybe this world is not \nfor us then actually jump ship and and \nwent to the post-grad and computer \nscience and kind of did a lot of \ntinkering back in the day \num you know tried to get a lot of little \nside hustles off the ground and so on \num eventually that wasn't the time sort \nof six years ago after the post grad so \ninstead went to our separate ways \num I was uh I was a consultant for a \ncouple years Finn worked as a software \nengineer and then I think last year we \nkind of started looking at each other \nand like man there's there's a lot of \nstuff happening in the space you know we \nwere trying to fine-tune our own GPT \ntrue models when that was the thing back \nin the day and both of us you know have \na lot of friends that run like developer \nfacing companies so we just kind of \nkind of like naturally began narrowing \nin on on this this this problem space \nwhich for us now is really just helping \ndevelopers use \num use uh software products \num and I guess yeah \nyeah amazing and I I really want to get \nmore I think you'll have such an \ninteresting perspective on this kind of \nfine-tuning models and how people think \nabout having their own custom large \nlanguage models is a topic I really want \nto explore but firstly I have this \nquestion about you know when you have a \nnew company like weavier for example \nthat you've gotten to Kappa how are you \nthinking about like how fast can I get \nthe documentation code like how do I get \nall this into these systems as fast as \npossible sort of \nright so maybe at the moment it takes us \nabout like a day or two depending on how \nmuch like the big the backlog is \num so we've found so far like because \nthis tag is super new and everybody is \nstill a little bit like uncertain what \nit can do and how it works you kind of \nneed like a very white glove approach to \nthis so like \num we're not really doing this like on a \nself-serve basis at the moment so we \nlike we just ask the companies okay what \nare your relevant sources \num like what should your Bot know about \nand then we like we kind of do it for \nthem at the moment and like hold their \nhand onto this in production \num just because it's so new and nobody \nreally knows how to work like how well \nit works what it can do what it can do \num and we can we can talk about like how \nwe ingest it if that's interesting \nyeah I'd love to dive into that topic I \nmean I can maybe speak a little bit to \nI've been trying to take this podcast \nand put it into eviate and so I you know \nI put it into whisper and I still I \nthink white glove I interpret is meaning \nlike manual cleaning still needed so \nlike I get the transcripts and I you \nknow specific terms like if we start \ntalking about like the Laura paper the \nlow rank adaptation like that particular \nword it'll probably translate Laura to \nlike lore l-a-u-r-a the name rather than \nl-o-r-a like so these little things is \nwhat I'm finding so um yeah data \ningestion this is the I'm so I really \nwant to pick your brain about this like \nhow much manual effort is still needed \nare you excited about things like you \nknow unstructured the Lang chain kind of \nPDF parsing thing like how you think \nabout data ingestion to these kind of \nsystems \num I like I think sort of all General \nexperience so far has been like it would \nbe great if you wouldn't have to do sort \nof any cleaning on the data like if you \ncould just put a full Self Service that \nworks automatically and you don't have \nto touch it at all and it's very simple \nthat'd be great and we've seen like \nquite a few people or like projects \ndoing that \num it tends to not work that well \nbecause you get a ton of things in there \nlike that mess with the performance and \ndown the line \num so you do have to like like if you if \nyou can get to a very clean state in the \nbeginning it'll work so much better in \nthe end \num that's \nyeah especially also how we've \nimplemented is like try and get to the \ncleanest version correct this version of \nthe data before you ingest it into the \nsystem like this \nyeah so maybe graduating from once we \nget the text from whether it's like a \nweb scrape and we got to kind of get the \nHTML tags out or you know PDF parsing we \nmight have some funky way it read like a \ntwo column layout or something like that \nso once you have the text how are you \nthinking about chunking it into Atomic \nunits and kind of having a symbolic \nstructure around it or maybe those are \ntwo separate questions maybe chunking \nfirst \num maybe like even like one step before \nthat would be like how do you even get \nto like a clean representation because \nso for us like um yeah like every \ncompany has like a lot of different \nsources that you would input it's not \nusually just a docs you have like \ndifferent pages for the tour the dogs \ntutorials like discourse forums GitHub \nissues \num and they tend to all have like \ndifferent structures for every company \nso you do need some type of like General \napproach to doing this so which for us \nmeans that the like web scraping at the \nmoment like having like a framework that \ncan generally handle all kinds of pages \num so that's sort of the first part uh \nto be able to even get everything and \nthen the second step you can think about \nlike cleaning chunking \num yeah \nyeah I'm really I think a lot about like \nsort of mimicking the system you've \nbuilt with our weeviate content and how \nthat would look I think about like just \nlike the symbolic filters where I'd have \nlike where title equals blog Play post \ntitle and then I like you know whatever \nit is and then I keep that with each of \nthe chunks \num yeah so that yeah it's really \ninteresting just like how you're parsing \nout the symbolic structure of someone's \ndocumentation I imagine I really want to \ndive into how you do you mentioned the \nDiscord can you tell me a little more \nabout how you mine out like Discord \nslack conversations and add it to this \nkind of retrieval system yep happy to \nmaybe maybe jump in here as well I think \nmaybe as a sort of a general theme what \nwhat Finn and I are slowly discovering \nas we're building out Kappa is that and \nthis maybe speaks to the broader nature \nof like you know where this you know \ntypes of applications like composite in \nthe ecosystem right is that there's so \nmany of these like you know bits of \nNiche information that are specific to a \nvertical we're very much in the \ndeveloper facing space right so that \nmeans like going out and talking to 10 \nof your customers to understand well how \ndo you view your discourse Forum right \nokay you know you have a certain number \nof people that reply that means okay \nwhen it's someone from the moderator \nteam we should probably ingest that into \nKappa doing just a full thread or do we \njust ingest the question answer pair and \nthe only reason like the only way you \nwould ever discover this is by going out \nand having a lot of these conversations \num and that's what we've done for by now \nI think a whole breadth of different \ntechnical documentation sources be that \nslack or discourse or GitHub issues \netc etc etc \nor maybe for slack specifically like \nevery company tends to have a slightly \ndifferent opinion on how their slack \nshould be ingested \num so we make like with kind of a bit of \na configurable framework to tailor it to \nlike each company and then the case of \nslack like what's good is that \neverything is already in threats so \neverybody every time somebody asks a \nquestion somebody replied creates a \nthread \num and then for example what we do like \none company might do like okay take all \nthe threats with the last year \num only take threats where someone from \na sort of whitelisted amount of people \nreplied or like from a team or specific \npeople and drop all the other messages \nand then take that sort of essay \nquestion answered here \nthat's sort of like you need to get to \nsome sort of non-noisy representation \nwhere you can be sort of short and \nnobody has said something wrong because \nyou might have a threat where somebody \nasks a question then there's like two \ncommunity members that say something \nwrong and at the end you have someone \nfrom the team that actually gives the \ncorrect answer and if you take all of \nthat you're just going to confuse your \nBot \nso you need to again back to like \ncleaning and getting like a non-noisier \nrepresentation \nyeah that's such an interesting nugget \nof how you do this I mean I I kind of \nhad two ideas like thinking firstly \nmaybe like you know whether it's just a \nclassifier to run cheaply or it's a \nlanguage model prompted like this to say \nlike you know is do you think the \noriginal answer is asker is happy with \nthis answer and doing some filtering \nlike that the whitelist thing very \ninteresting um the academic in me who \nyou know I love the idea of kind of \nbenchmarking these systems so that you \ncan sort of ablate the models and I \ncan't wait to talk to you about the \nmodels but like do you do you maybe like \ntake 50 of these threads and then have \nsome system of \nyou know replacing maybe the whitelisted \nperson with the language model and then \nfrom there you get some sense of how \nwell Kappa works like is there some kind \nof like like I guess I'm trying to get \nout is have you have you thought about \nthis kind of like you know using like \nthese like these abstractive question \nanswering extracted summarization \nmetrics like Rouge blue scores on these \nkind of bootstrapped examples of \nconversation threads where say I'm on \nthe white list and you replace Connor \nwith you know with Kappa and then you \nsay here is the comparison of the final \nanswer \nso so far we've just used the data as is \num to keep its like so we can so you can \ngo to the customer and tell them like \nhey this is exactly like what's going to \nbe in there like there's not going to be \nanything generated you don't control so \nthe company actually knows okay we only \nhave this set of information because \nthey tend to get a little like skittish \nif you start to generate some things and \nso on like it kind of slips the control \na little bit \num and you might introduce some sort of \nwrong things and some like something \nhallucinated that shouldn't be there so \nthe moment it's just like I'm sure some \nof these things would work quite well \num at the moment we're not doing it one \nthing we're probably going to do is like \ngenerate a title \nuh where you could go like hey here was \nit because slack for it doesn't have \nlike a somewhere a summary title but you \ncould generate one of the conversation \nsaying like Okay this was what this was \nabout \num that would probably help \num \nyeah I just saw uh Jerry and llama index \ntweeting about their uh like summary \nindex where you summarize long things \nand yeah yeah it's such a cool idea and \nyeah the really cool first like I guess \nbefore transitioning to the \nhallucination problem which I think is \nsuch an open such a big topic for this \napplication I I guess the question I \nreally want to ask and get your you know \nexperience of building this thing out is \nlike you know how how do you tell \nleviate or whoever like how well Kappa \nis how good Kappa is like \nyeah yeah no it's a super good question \nI mean the short answer is you know the \nthe potential accuracy threshold of an \napplication like Kappa really also \nvaries across projects right you know \nyou might be lucky and and be dealing \nwith you know a company like VBA that \nhas fantastic dogs you know like a deep \nset of technical tutorials threads oh \nseriously right \num and and for which you can actually \nget a bot that can be quite performant \num and then there are other times where \nyou know the company think they might \nhave sort of great dogs but then \nactually when it comes down to it \nthere's a lot of sort of holes so so the \nshort answer is it's really just again \nhaving conversations with with the \ncustomers trying to understand like you \nknow average accuracy metrics based on \nsort of thumbs up thumbs down that helps \nkind of proxy that \num and then also just sort of setting \nexpectations for where the tech is today \nyeah and I know from my experience using \nKappa I've seen you know the thumbs up \nthumbs down and that that it will be \nwell I I want to park that because I \nwant to come back into this idea of \nowning your own language model and how \nyou could bootstrap data that way but \nlet's hit the hallucinations thing \nbecause you know naturally I think the \nthe biggest thing is I yeah yeah how are \nyou think about hallucinations right now \nI mean I think that the short answer is \nit's probably the thing we've \nhistorically thought the most about \num you know I can I can name countless \nof experiments \num conversations with academics like \nscanning through the latest archive \npapers like trying to figure out like \nhow can we bring down hallucinations and \nthere's probably not an approach we \nhaven't tried but to be honest ask these \nmodels are getting more powerful for \nexample you know upgrading from from our \nfrom our case we run an open AI as our \nlast sort of off-the-shelf generation \nmodel just making that bump up from uh \ndavinci03 to gpt4 already helps address \na lot of that \nand then in addition you know we think a \nlot about sort of nudging Kappa to \nalways produce an uncertain answer as \nopposed to a a sort of a potentially \ncreative answer \num which means today Hallucination is \nnot really a problem we deal with in \nproduction \nfascinating so \nso the current state of just kind of \nprompting it like please ground your \nanswer in this context and then just \nplease don't make anything up in all \ncapital letters or something like that \njust \nthat alone seems to be strong with the \nstrong morals but so I guess my question \nwith with that well it comes into the \ntransitioning topic of I'm very curious \nabout how you think about the large \nlanguage models because um you know so \nthe running gbt for every query I \nimagine is kind of expensive so are you \nare you interested in the open source \nmodels like you know llama gbt for all \nlike the Mosaic MPT these kind of Trends \nand then but then did they not have this \nhallucin like then you have to rethink \nabout hallucination \nI mean the short answer here is \nincredibly excited about the potential \num I mean for one from a cost \nperspective and potentially latency down \nthe line right \num but also very excited because I mean \none of the common concerns right you \nhear when deploying these these models \nin production is you know ownership of \ndata and transferring and so on so I \nwould love to be able to offer Kappa \non-prem \num as a service which would be possible \ndown the line with something like an \nopen source llama Etc \num but right now honestly it's not \nsomething we spend a lot of time \nthinking about just because the I mean \nthe whole focus is really \nyou know a slower but better answer is \nis usually preferred \nand um you're just you're very right \nlike these it's it's quite expensive at \nthis point which means from an economic \nperspective like some much larger \ncontext Windows aren't necessarily \nfeasible for this use case \nbecause you have to look at it okay like \nhow much is one question answered or one \ngeneration worth \nenter like in sort of the economic terms \nfor like your customer and can I even \nuse something like a 32k like context \nwindow like does it make sense \num and for us like at the moment it's \nlike cost is fine but like for example \nusing like 30k context window will \nprobably wouldn't be we couldn't sell \nthat most likely \nfascinating I mean I think um \nyeah so I think the gbt4 32k and then I \nsuspect that the anthropic uh 100K that \nboth work with like this API thing I \nsuspect that yes both those are quite \nexpensive but I'm so excited about this \nmosaics uh 65 billion parameter oh I \nthink it's 7 billion sorry 65 000 input \nwindow is um is something you can run in \nTransformers I think it's I think \nbasically the way they're doing this is \nthey call it Alibi attention and it's \nkind of like the newest sparse attention \nvariant where sparse attention is you \nnever have that like dense matrix \nmultiplication where you multiply 65 000 \nby 65 you know and create these gigantic \nmatrices that obviously can't fit on a \nsingle GPU and the whole problem but \nwith with those kind of models it makes \nme think that maybe they can \nuh cheaply run it yeah I don't know too \nmuch about it but I'm the question I \nreally want to ask you about these long \ninput length models is like \nwith retrieval and you know obviously \nyou're working on aggregating all these \ninformation sources for companies like \nWi-Fi documentation code based blog \nposts code examples this podcast maybe \nright so like do you think packing the \nprompt as densely as possible would \nwould be the future of that \nI mean maybe at some point but right now \nfor sure not I mean you really like \nif like what you want to get is like the \nsmallest amount of relevant context to \nanswer the question like that's ideal \nright so that's where you get the least \nhallucination the most crisp answer \num \nif you I mean you can fit a lot more \ninto the context movement we're doing \nright now that wouldn't necessarily it \nwill make more expensive and it wouldn't \nnecessarily improve the answer or make \nit worse \num maybe at some point it's so good but \nright like right now in a super future I \nthink you should definitely want this \nretrieval step \num to give you like the relevant context \nI mean the more irrelevant things you \nadd the less you the worse your answer \ngets hey everyone sorry we had a little \nbit of a recording a little bit of a \nconnection issue but we're back uh so \nwhen we left off we were talking about \nthese kind of long input length models \nand the trends in that I think it \nactually would be great to kind of pivot \ninto this next conversation which is the \ntrends in fine-tuning your own large \nlanguage model which is we're seeing \nwith Laura l-o-r-a the low rank \nadaptation it's it's like a trend in the \nsparse fine tuning where now you can \nfine tune like a seven you know a \nbillion parameter model for like 20 \nbucks and or I don't know about 20 I \nthink I've seen like a hundred dollars \nis arbitrarily obviously depends on the \nsize of the model and how long you're \ngonna train it for but yeah so what how \ndo you think this will change everything \nfine-tuning language models are \ncompanies going to want to own their own \nlanguage model \nI I think and I'm just speaking \nanecdotally here also with conversations \nwith other Founders in the space I think \nfine tuning has a lot of promise and \nwhere fine tuning can really deliver \nvalue to folks in the real world that's \nvery much stylistically in terms of the \nthe types of answers it generates but if \nyou're thinking about fine-tuning from a \nlike accurate knowledge retrieval step \num I I think you'd still run into a ton \nof hallucination problems \nat least anecdotally speaking you know \nwhen we've done countless of fine-tuning \nexperiments and and it's it's really \nyou've just run into hallucination as \nopposed to having \num like I think I think Sam Altman had a \ntweet a couple of months ago saying like \nlike talking about some new opening eye \npricing and history was something like \nyou know I think most people would be \nhappy to pay like two dollars for a \nthousand tokens but a thousand really \nhigh quality tokens and I still think \nthat still holds true \num also from I would say our perspective \nmeaning I'd much rather have a a great \noff-the-shelf you know high accuracy \nHigh reasonability off-the-shelf model \nmaybe just to add to that like um \nfrom what we've seen like with we had \ntwo customers so far that uh like in the \npast like sort of before \nlike like sort of last year took a bunch \nof their support tickets so like some of \nthem had like 3 000 emails for example \ngoing back and forth and find you in \ntheir own like \nI guess like what was available like I \nforget what exactly they find you but \nthey had sort of what Kappa is now \nthemselves but purely find you without \nany retrieval and use that to like \ngenerate answers to support tickets \num and now I've moved off that and just \nuse us \num and yeah like we we basically took \nthe same data that you used to fine tune \nput it into their bot \num and it like just anecdotally to them \nit works better this way \num \nyeah fascinating I think working on a \nvector database I think you might expect \nthat my reaction to this news is just \nlike you know thumbs up all the way yeah \nbut I don't think these two classes of \nalgorithms are like approaches have to \nconflict like this like I think you can \nstill have a retrieval augmented \ngeneration with a fine-tuned model and \nyeah you still have the benefit of It \nkind of can cited sources a little bit \nyou can update the information based it \nso I don't I would start by saying I \ndon't see these as two like different \nthings like if the Laura algorithm is \nsuccessful that means and the vector \ndatabases and all that kind of thing but \nyeah I think something fascinating about \nit is like \nthere's this like robustness like this \nGeneral language understanding that \ncomes from these large models with how \nthey've been pre-trained and I do think \nlike if you fine tune it you might lose \nthat kind of robust like you as you \nmentioned like the hallucination problem \nbecomes more so yeah and we've seen that \nlike crazy with the there's a lot of \nexperiments like clip there's this paper \ncalled wiseft where they show that like \nyou know if you just fine-tune clip you \nlose like the robustness of it and it's \nreally interesting yeah I mean um \nthe idea of fine-tuning on support \ntickets I mean have you ever like the \nwhen I've talked to like you know I've \ntalked to Jonathan Franco in the podcast \nabout Mosaic ml's philosophy with owning \nyour own language model and it's like \nhave you seen someone who has just so \nmuch Text data that you would pre-train \nthe language model on it and so it's not \neven like fine-tuning it's like the the \nlanguage modeling objective is done with \nthis data set \nmaybe the biggest we've seen so far \nlike you never really get a like passed \nagain \ntwo three thousand pages of text \nsort of like Loosely speaking \num nobody has like an insane amount of \nvaluable data \nfor like their specific I mean like the \nbest case scenario would be somebody has \nlike really really extensive talks and \nlike apri reference that has a ton of \nlike good GitHub issues in very \nlike big discourse forum and then maybe \nlike their past like conversations but \neven with like if that all is really big \nyou don't really get past like 3 000 \npages of text or something like that \nyeah that's really fascinating because \nit makes me think like good like good \ndocumentation should be sort of compact \nI suppose like right like it's also I \nmean it's so interesting like should \ncompanies be trying to create as much \ndigital content as possible in this \nworld or should they be like have a \nreally refined compact \ndocumentation or and there or are there \nlike two things you mix all right like \nyou have the source of Truth highly \ncurated and then like you know this \npodcast how we just fire it on and just \nstart talking and creating content like \ntwo kinds of content \nI mean for some like like we sometimes \ndebate this with the blogs of companies \nbecause some of these are like technical \ntutorials almost how to do something and \nthat's relevant probably to developers \nbut also some companies write a lot of \nblogs for sort of CEO optimization \nuh sort of some general news which is \nlike Loosely related to them and it's \nthat's not necessarily super valuable \nfor you like the QA board \num it does have to has to be like really \nreally high quality text I mean one \ninteresting thing regarding that as well \nis that so \nyou will have a lot of relevant okay \ncompanies will have like a lot of tech \nand documentation around their product \nbut to understand that you still need a \nlot of other like more fundamental \nunderstanding of things like programming \nand like other Frameworks and operating \nsystems and if you take all that away \nlike then their technical augmentation \nreally doesn't make much sense so you \nneed some like \nmodel that understands sort of all the \ncontext beneath what their product is \nabout \nfascinating I mean especially it's like \nI think there are two things so this is \nlike the gbt4 knows already knows Python \nand JavaScript so you don't need to go \nget the python documentation and \nretrieve from that but then it's like \nsay like with weaviate like if we \nintegrate like we integrate with Lang \nchain and then like Lang chain is \ncontinually evolving such that the large \nlanguage models can't keep up so it so \nyou so have you ever thought about \nadvising someone to grab the \ndocumentation of like another library \nthat they integrate with closely \nwe have like we have a few of those \ncustomers like \num react this has been like kind of a \ngood example of that it's a lot of \nframework front-end Frameworks a lot of \nlike things that interact with react for \nsome of them we've put it in like as \nwell \num there's a little bit the like bit of \na business question of well do I want my \nbot to know like that well about this \nother framework \nbecause data documentation will contain \nalso some like oh how real how great is \nreact on its own and things like this \nand it might lead a little bit away from \ntheir product so it's \nbit of an \nlike it's kind of like a case-by-case \ndecision if you put it in or not if it's \nlike valuable \num I think so far it's been kind of yeah \nsuccessful for a few people \nyeah fascinating I think yeah I think \nthat's something that even humans like \nas we create content we need to think \nabout it's not even just the language \nmodels like am I just advising you to \nuse Lang chain instead of the leviate \ngenerate module this is a little thing \nto hit that but um okay so the next \ntopic I really want to ask you about is \nalleviate we're curious about this \nconcept called that we're calling \ngenerative feedback loops to describe \nwhen the language model transforms the \ndata in some way like maybe you know \nwrite us some like the summarization is \none example \nlike how do you think about transforming \ndata and then saving it to further help \nwith the retrieval \nthat's I think that's a really \ninteresting area and to be honest we \nhaven't we haven't really explored \na lot of generative steps at the \nretrieval stage \num \nI think it's one like I see Jerry from \nllama index tweeting out a bunch of \nstuff on this topic right so it is a \nreally interesting thing that probably \ncould help with with retrieval \num but maybe you're just one General \nobservation \nis \nI think when working in in this space \nright we're always very quick \num to quickly throw like a language \nmodel on a problem like oh great you \nknow maybe we can summarize something \nhere maybe we could do something here \nand I think that the general observation \nis \nit it \nkind of rarely works very very very well \nbecause by every step you introduce like \nanother GPT caller every step you \nintroduce one more thing you have to \nbuild a ton of guardrails to ensure you \nhave a stable system to handle edge \ncases \nEtc so it's a lot of the time when sort \nof thinking about you have to really \nzoom out and think about systems design \nas you're introducing one more layer of \nnoise that being said I think this is \nprobably a stage that is definitely \nworth \nI explore any further \num \nyeah it's fascinating I mean I think \nlike it's like the large language model \nOverkill solution is the pro is it \npotential like I can say just from my \nexperience of like you know I have 477 \npodcast Clips in this podcast search \ndata set that you guys will soon be a \npart of and yeah and you know I as I \nSummarize each of these clips that cost \nme about four dollars to do 477 so you \nknow and it linearly scales of course \nlike that kind of thing so so yeah like \nI saw I saw Jerry what and one of the \nnewer ideas is use the large language \nmodel to truncate the search results so \nsay you get you know 10 search results \nlanguage models says only take the first \nthree and then to the next step and I \nthink that might be it Overkill \nit's like also using it for re-ranking \nis yeah I think we had something like \nthat in the beginning which didn't like \nkept throwing out like really random \nthings and then we got rid of it yeah \nyeah awesome \nno go ahead Connor okay I was gonna ask \nkind of um you know wrapping of the \npodcast these are this has been a great \ncoverage of just how you think about \ncustomer uh companies getting all of the \nlike particularly software companies \ngetting all their content into these \nsystems uh thoughts on the trends and \nlonger inputs and then fine-tuning and \nthen just generally thinking about how \nyou think about your content all these \ntopics I want to ask kind of an \nopen-ended question of like what what \nTopics in deep learning and AI is \nexciting you the most right now \nman's like where to start right I I \nthink you know as sort of the founder of \nthe space or Founders in the space it's \nit's always a daily battle between \ntrying to you know dig deep into the \ninto the next new thing to read that \nnext like paper to begin implementing \nlike another idea to improve the system \nand then also just \num just kind of getting back to the \nbasics which you know in our case is \ntalking to customers and and Building \nProduct right so but but I mean to \nanswer your question without answering \nyour question here I think maybe areas \nwhere we're really paying attention to \nnow is like well what does it mean that \nyou have 100K context window all right \nwhat does that unlock what new ways of \nactually helping out your set of \ncustomers can you do with this feature \nright \num and you know it could be a ton right \nyou know to your point maybe it is \nactually worth this like cost latency \ntrade-off to you know have a longer call \na more expensive call but a more \naccurate one right \nI think that is probably the thing \nthat's at least keeping me \npersonally up at night right now \nyeah I like that point a lot too like I \nI was very interested in like cross \nencoder re-ranking so that's like \nre-ranking search results with it not a \nlanguage like a 80 million parameter \nit's still slower and yes I think also \nin this new world you're willing to wait \nlonger and that's a very interesting \nTrend uh let me ask you two startup \nquestions so first of which is this \nthing you talk about talking to \ncustomers I'm just curious on generally \ngetting people's perspectives on your \nwork like working on a deep technical \nproduct do you think Innovation comes \nfrom you know the customers and seeing \ntheir use cases or maybe like this kind \nof like \nreading the science like you're you're \neither like deeply in the science or \nyou're at like the application layer and \ntrying to see like what's the next thing \nto do from those two perspectives \nI mean think for us because we're sort \nof the application at the application \nlayer so directly like try I mean we're \nproductizing something and putting it to \nuse so it's less of an infrastructure \nproduct so here I think relate like I \nthink what's been super successful \nversus relationship management with \ncustomers sort of just like classic like \nbe available hold their hand talk to \nthem often and kind of like ease them \ninto deploying it so that's been super \nimportant to us \num maybe less so than like very very \ndeep technical Innovation \num but I guess this depends on where you \nare in this like sort of the stack I \nguess if you go down one level to \nalleviate that's a little different \num \nand it's sort of sorry sorry no I was \njust gonna say and it's it's sort of \nright it's one of these it's sort of one \nand the other it's like it's totally \ntrue with Finn is saying it's like \nspending time like deeply empathizing \nwith customers to understand what \nproblems are they actually hoping to \nstuff can solve like when you go past \nthe cool Twitter demo or um or you know \nLoom recording or whatever but at the \nsame time you know it is also such a new \nand fast moving space so you do have to \nconstantly pay attention to like what's \nhappening in the science you do have to \nlike every single like you know news \nblurb that comes out like 100k content \nyou do need to contextualize that \nin from the perspective of the customers \nfor whom you're trying to solve a \nproblem for \nfascinating I'd say maybe like to give a \nquick example from weviate like the new \nand this isn't like I'm not like \nrevealing private information this is \nlike something that we set up a pocket \nlike the the group by filter that came \nfrom like a customer request as an \nexample but then like on the other end \nlike the research we're doing on disk a \nn and like you know kind of like the PQ \nstuff and filter disconnect if you go \ninto the weeds of it that's not really \nsomething that a customer would ask for \nbecause they don't think about Vector \nindexes like to know what the like to \ntweet to make it different so I think \nthat's sort of the perspective of of how \nI see the abstraction layers and yeah \nit's so super interesting um so then the \nsecond question I wanted to ask you \nwhich with kind of like a startup \nquestion you already hinted at it is \nlike this CRM the trends in growing a \ncommunity and a set of customers is like \ndo you think about like using the large \nlanguage models to manage your sort of \nrelationships with people and it is are \nwe seeing like a huge breakthrough in \nthat \nyeah I'm happy to take this I mean I I \nthink I'd like to thank both Finn and I \nare kind of by this point quite like \nnative with like all this stuff I mean \nmost of our coding is done either with \nlike with Kappa dog fooding it ourselves \nor like c54 or you know clutter or \nwhatever the latest model is \num but but this stuff I think it's just \nold school relationship management \ninstalled it that kind of works \num I mean don't get me wrong we're \nalways trying like new new launches \nscouring product hunt but um I think \nyeah nothing beats sitting down getting \non a zoom call and actually talking to \nyour customers \nyeah I agree fully with the value in \ndoing that I guess I just like something \nthat I find really interesting and this \nis kind of like the angle that we're \ntaking with our generative feedback loop \nthing is like when a new blog post comes \nout or like you know we V8 1.20 comes \nout when we have this new set of \nfeatures is like going into the CRM and \nsaying in Target and saying like you \nknow hey you would like this because you \nworked on this in the language model \njust does all that \nI'm sure someone will build like an \nawesome like \num llm Native uh CRM I'd love to use \nthat tool yeah \nme too \nso email and Finn guys thank you so much \nfor joining the podcast I think this is \nsuch a great coverage I mean you guys \nare at The Cutting Edge of putting the \ndocumentation into these systems I you \nknow just from I've used it the kapha \nand it's awesome so thumbs up on how \nwell it works and good luck with \neverything \nthanks appreciate you having us on \nConnor and a ton of fun \n",
