{"text": "Weaviate Academy Unit 2: Get Function. \nhello and welcome back to waviate Academy in this section we're going to dive into the world of the get function the get function is used to retrieve objects from the object store in waviate retrieving objects from wavier is probably the most common operation to perform for many users for instance you might want to find relevant passages from a collection of books retrieve information on a particular type of users or even images most similar to another image in waviate you use the get function to do all of those things to use it you need to specify the class of objects you want to retrieve this is the term in waviate for collections of objects and you also need to specify the properties to retrieve for each object let's get an example of a basic Standalone get query in this case we're querying this class for the shown properties with a limit of the number of results as shown here the response from waviate then will be in Json format reflecting the structure of the get query and the properties of the objects being retrieved the class n properties Fields being retrieved must corresponds to objects and properties that are stored in waviate in what is called the schema you'll learn more about how to construct the schema in another unit but knowing how to use a defined schema will help you immensely when it comes time to build your own schema and to populate waviate with it you can also use the get function to retrieve additional properties that aren't explicitly defined in the schema these could be inherents the object like the ID or the vector or related to the query performed like the distance below we've built examples for you to try out for yourself follow the inline exercises to practice constructing different gate queries retrieving various properties and working with additional fields that's it for this video thanks for watching and we'll see in the next one ", "type": "Video", "name": "Queries - Get Function", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2UuBIJVLEM", "timestamp": "", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
