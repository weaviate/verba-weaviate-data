{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the 60th Weaviate podcast with Patrice Bourgougnon! Patrice is the creator of ... \nhey everyone thank you so much forwatching another episode of the weviapodcast I'm super excited to welcomePatrice burgundy on to the podcastPatrice is one of the most active opensource contributors to weviate filingissues you know poking it apart seeingthe new updates and so I'm so excited tochat with Patrice quickly um Patrice Iremember you gave this feedback when refto VEC first came out and that reallymeant a lot to me and so just all thesecontributions like really it's just soawesome to see I expect this to be sucha deep conversation into you know whatyou're building and the miscellaneousfeatures of webiate and your perspectiveon it so firstly thank you so much forjoining the podcastI'm very happy to be in your podcast I'mfollowing you for quite a long time nowwe can start the podcast with um likeyou know like to set the stage for ourlisteners like what are you buildingso I'm a developer for a long time nowand I'm building a plugin on extensionfor WordPress andmore specifically woocommerce but itworks for naked workplace too and theidea is to have a better search in inWordPress than the standard MySQLuh search which is I think it's not evenfull text search so there are plenty ofplugins and the specificity of a WPsolar which is the the plugin is to useexternal search enginesuh to to power the search for manyreason performance uhcapabilities features attunability andso on and so onyeah super quiet I think like um yeahlike WordPress I I remember like youknow back early like early days when Iwas learning about almost like theinternet to say with WordPress like howWordPress helps you set up this websiteand that kind of integration of likesemantic search and advanced AI uh toolsinto WordPress it all sounds sointeresting can you maybe tell me aboutlike yeah like how's like how's like thebusiness of running that kind of thinglike what are sort of the nuances ofthat marketyou mean for ai ai searchyeah I guess just the like it must be aninteresting it's kind of like no codelike can you tell me a little more aboutlike how you kind of would the theexperience of this kind of like buildingAI into something like WordPress yes souh WordPress it's it's something alittle bit uhspecific compared to headless Solutionsnow no code solution and so on becauseyou you can have both of words you canbe fully knockoutbut you have access to its open sourceand you install it in your on yourserver or on a hospitalhosted service and you can access thefull full code and you can modify thenot the core of Wordpress obviouslybecause each if you update the core andnext word is you lose your your card butyou can create what is what is name theplugin an extension that you push youupload on your server and it doesreally whatever you want that's thatvery that's why I'm I love WordPress asa developer because you can go for nocode or for full code completelysomething completely custom so in interms of a marketfor small businesses that they they tendto to use on the Shelf plugins withminimal configurations and andbut you know it's it's a it's anaddiction so many many word personas uhand with a hundred plugin in their uhin their website and it's it can be aproblem for inter uh entire operabilitybetween the plugins so you install oneit breaks another one and so oncompatibility with WordPress versionsuh so there's a trade-off installingonly the ones that you need but it'sdifficult because you have thousands ofplugins availableand for more specifically for searchplugins you have plugins which areworkingwith WordPress inside WordPress onlyum soextending extending WordPress but butstay inside WordPress and sellingnothing specific socontinuing to to work with my SQL as asearch engineand other plugins which are using likelike minor which are using externalsolutions that can be itself hosted orhosted on a SAS Service as wellso are these um like I remember when Ifirst saw like WordPress plugins youhave like PHP what kind of like uhlanguages are using to connect weviateand um WordPressthat's uhthat's something which is kind of uh ofa limitation uhtoday uh the market uh is a pizza Nickfor for AIand so everything is python so that'sthat's probably a good reason why Ichose uh we had two years ago when Istarted evaluating the market and thefeatures performance and so onbecause if uh if you don't have theembeddles the vectorizers inside theyour vector databaseyou'll have to produce somehow thevectors from the data you have inWordPress woocommerce so you you willhave to send the title descriptionattributes like pricecolor sizes for for woocommerce andcreate a vector gets back the vector andsend it to to the vector database likewe've yet or another oneand vectorization isalmost 100 percent made frompython clientsusing python in WordPressI don't take it I don't think it'sreally possible in fact sothere are two solutions either with thePHP clientwhich doesn't exist for widgetor if you havethe chance or Merchants to be adeveloper you can do it because we yetprovide the two apiswhich is very specific one is a rest APIto do everything from managing a widgetand for instance uploading your data tovectorizeumbut you have also graphqlAPI to to do the search thing sosearching with vectors filteringaggregatinguh and so on but it's also a kind ofrest API in factsoin a way I had to create my own PHPclient inside WordPress calling the restapis ofViet it's not a clean PHP client so itcan be uh open source and so on becauseit's it's really difficult to build thereal one with and take theresponsibility to maintain it andlet's say it's a it's a kind of miniversion of a PHP client hmm yeah thatthat topic and we made always fascinatesme like the all the different clientslike a recent podcast we had Andre who'sbuilding uh Lang chain Ruby you knowlike kind of like building all thesetools native to Ruby you know like uh wehave a when we were doing theintegration with Microsoft symantekernel we were then building like for Csharplike typescript yeah[Laughter]no it is a big subject for is repressingkeeping the pythonic API interfaces butto replacing with something behind thescene with something faster like uh likerust for instance so I think upon thattool is rest or something like that andthe the thing uh yes multi-languagemulti yes multi languages is a big topicuh usually it's done with thewith client builderslike open API and yaml file and so onbut uhuh currently as far as I know yes forviviet it's a pythonunder the and that's it soit's not a big deal in fact if you don'thave to implement the or rest API if weyet you just have to concentrate on afew features and that's uh that's enoughin factumPHP is mostly nowadays[Music]I could make enemies here but it'smostly about WordPress Drupal CMSapart from projects for big companieswhich are producing the full stack inthe PHP like say Symphony for instanceor laravel uhsoprobably in the future there will beless less PHP uh clientsI don't think there will be much morethan than todayyeah but I I uh one more kind oftechnical question on how you'rebuilding with we V8 before we get intohigher level topics about you know justthe broad space but like I'm curiousabout how you're using these likeinference containers like you haveweavier and then you also have like thetext of that clip and so on like how areyou thinking about managing those two uhlike uh services like you know thedatabase and then the inferencecontainersuh it's important I don'tI I didn't get that to uh to will get soin widget you have indeed the thestateless and the stateful uh part andthe stateful is uh it's a pure of ablack black boat at my level so it'ssingle and I don't even know how itworks so storystoring vectorsalgorithm and so onumbutto uh let's say you're in uh in theBurpee solar now in the the WordPressAdministration so you selected yoursearch engine types or widget and thenyou have several choices so you have achoice a drop down list of vectorizersso use you can select all currently Ithink all the vectorizer is availablenot all for we can discuss about thatforbecause I don't right now though I don'tdo um image similarity so I do text toimage but not image to to text or imageto imageso you select let's say a text to textto backuh clipopen AI uhCorrea and now Google pen too and theonly thing I do from the plugin from thePHP code in factis calling the rest API of who yet andconfigure creating a a new class a classin widget being the equivalent ofa table let's say in MySQL and theparameters that are sent with this classcreation are somedefault field the field types and thevectorizer and then a few parametersdepending on the vectorizer you havechosen for instance if you choose theclip vectorizer you have to choose a fitfor instance the percentage of search intext or in in images if you choose thehybrid vectorizerI know hybrid it's in graphql that'sanother question but so parametersdepends on the vectorizer you've chosenin in WP solar but that's that'sa bit magic here theyou you have toyou have to think a little bit beforebecause you need okay I need a clip forinstance I want to use Docker I want toinstall Docker somewhere perhaps on thesame server as WordPress so you have toproduce your Docker widget file with thevector with the the clip modelconfigured so you go to uh to we get tothe widget site there's a nice wizard toproduce folding configuration possibleincluding the clip and then you youdownload the docker file and you modifyit if necessary and you launch it sothat the only thing which is a bit uha bit not completely Integrity becausethat's but there's no way to to gofurther in fact uh so launching theright Docker with a right vectorizerand after that you choose the samevectors in WP Sera and everything isdone automatically on the classdefinitionthat's it you you can rather thaninstalling Docker you can installkubernetesand the the description andconfiguration made and we've yet withwebsite is greatso you just I'm not at all a specialistof kubernetes and I could manageto install it for my demos and for somecustomers also and it's pretty great andkubernetes is greatyeah well at first said I just wouldlike to say that I'm not much of a cloudexpert myself you know I've been aroundwe've had enough to know a bit of thesethings and so you know luckily I havePatrice here today likeum you know I remember like when I wasearly I was like doing consulting and Ihad like a website that I hosted onGoDaddy and so I just had like connectedlike I had just um like put my stripething in JavaScript right on the websiteso is that kind of similar to how youcan uh install Docker and run the weviacontainersno because so when you forward press youhave several options uh you have optionswhere the server is is completelyinvisible to youso you go to a site like you said a goodidea or similar hosting providersand you just click on the button thatsays create a new WordPress for mea little bit of parameters but thatthat's it and after that you you neverhave access to your WordPress server orperhaps you will have access to to thefile system of your WordPress but onlywith FTPso no SSH access no remote accessnothing so you you can't installanything at that99.9 percent of uh WordPress ownerstodayuh another possibility that in fact youare you are installing it on a dedicatedvirtual machineuhand thenpotentially you you could have someaccess to the machine and install yourDocker for instance or even a smallkubernetes a monoc cluster or two notclusters on it but in general you willhave to to install your widget outsideof yourWordPress service or server uhit could be on the same hosting providerfor instance so you've done that forWordPress and then you rent a host andyou install your Docker or you create aon the same machine product or anotherone you create your Caster or clusterservice like your Google cloud or Amazonor Microsoft or any other and so on andso onyeah I think I mean like one more likeit's kind of hopefully not too broad anduh like rhetorical but like this kind oflike you know deviates open sourcing ofthese Docker images as well as like thekubernetes helm charts how how has thatkind of impacted your developmentexperience with Wiiuh it's pretty standard for it's prettystandard for for me in fact uhcurrently uh WP solar can connect to506 search engines and most of them areopen sourceelasticsearch Apache Apache solar opensearch now which is a fork ofelasticsearchuhand after they are closed the searchservice which are such services and sothat's pretty pretty similarwe starting with yet is like installingathat there's a small difference indeedin fact it's exactly the same but it'sdifferent because the there are nocurrently as far as I know there are nouh hosting companies providing widget asa serviceexcept a widget himself with a is a withyet Crystal server serviceso in general what I'm used to is forlet's say elastic search I I'm going toa hosting service uhlikeelastic.co like Bonsai there'splenty of them and so and that's thesame Principle as WordPress that meansit's a you click you select okay I wantthis this member of ram I want the sizeof disk and so on and from there youhave a dashboard and uh you have a youhave a token and from this token youenter it in WP solar and it's connectedso that would be exactly the sameprocess apart from the fact thatcurrently it can be done to my knowledgeonly on with just hosting services sofor for some customers IIused to install a kubernetes kubernetescluster for for we yetespecially becausefor instance a customer needed the clipthe clip modelif I remember the clip model is is notpart of the hosting package ofof we if we get so anyway I would havehad even if I was a student at 12 yet Iwould have had to install it but it'spossible to do bothyou can start with vehicles or Serviceswhich is great because it's very easy toset up you don't have to set it up infactsame as for WordPress you you go tothere to you register you click on abutton it creates a crystal service youget your tokenand you put this token in WB solar withyour user passwordI thinkbefore it was user password now it's atoken if I rememberit's two years ago soit looks like a dinosaur nowum so yes widget has now plenty ofauthentication schemes so you hugechoose the one you want and after thatyou say I want uhI I want uh Noob for instance uh an openAi vectorizer and that's it you do itand then you send your data from the wpserver andand so on but if you need somethingdifferent for instance you you haveTrends so that's another Marketlet's say you have trained thevectorizer model a sentence aTransformer modelI don't know who would be able to dothat but it's it's possiblethen you would need to uh to use thismodel and you would have to install yourkubernetes cluster probablyand uh upload your models and so onyeah let's so we're going to come backinto this kind of like yeah your ownmodel but yeah I think just the storythat we're to ever read a transitiontopics now but like this I love thisstory this like umyou know I again I don't claim to be anexpert in this I'm just kind offollowing along with the Wii via storyand learning from like an interest inVector search and seeing how theMarket's playing out but you have likethis uh you know leviate and these bigVector database companies building outthis like cloud service platform on likeGoogle Amazon Microsoft like a big youknow cloud services and you know there'sengineering teams that build this butthen you also have this open sourcing oflike kubernetes Helm charts and Dockerimages and then you have this Marketemerges that uh you know it's it's I seeit as it's kind of like Consulting butthen it's there's even so muchopportunity in the cloud and findingniches of how people want to run it thatit even becomes almost like SAS quicklyhere's this ass I see and so yeah I Iagain I don't know yeahit's ayou you you that's that's a great thingor or not because it's opinionatedpeople prefer to be needed people prefernot to be opinionated so it's easierwhen you have no choiceyou have no choice okay it will it willbe fine because that's my only choiceand that's typically the smaller thesmaller business Market uhwith the small business Market onetypically one owner for woocommerce shopthe idea of installing will get anywhereon the uh it doesn't have any idea whatis with yet it doesn't have any ideawhat is Vector searchwhat what is interest what isinteresting in is AI search because AIsearch is a marketing and so AI is it'sa synonym for magic in fact so all whatyou could couldn't do before you will beable to do itthat's that's the magicit's kind of magic but it's notcompletely magic so it can be a littlebit deceiving but that things which arepretty magicso for this kind of customersthey must have something much easier anduhbut buteven if the theSE guys that have chosen to go to AIDSAI search and go to an external searchengine and so on even them area little bit different from the veryaverage WordPress or woocommerce user Iguesswouldn't dare to to to go the this verymuddy roads andso that they would prefer the the searchplugin I mentioned before which stay inWordPressoutside nothing to configure and whichis fine it's only when the the the reachthe problems that they really need thesekind of Solutions in general they theycome to WP solar or similar solutionsfor two reasons one is performanceso if you have 500 000 products in youruh woocommerce catalogyour search will will die because fulltext search on the with filters withaggregation for faceting and so onpagination salting and so on it's athat's not possible with uh with thestandard technology okay you can scaleup your your machine and so on but ifyou have a little bit it will be finewith the two or three concrete onchoosers but if at the same time youhave plenty of visitors Black Fridaythings and so on your your absolutelythat because this kind of things cannotreally be cachedpeople often think that they will scalebecause you are cashing but with searchit's very difficult to catch becausethere are so many parametersit's not the same keywords it's not thesame filters it's not the sameaggregationsit's not the same Pages or paginationit's not the same sort so every you youcan't cache because uh you you wouldneed the database or terabytesumsoyes there are really several markets andso the small very small ones they stayinside WordPress for for their searchsome who have some issues and uh so I Imentioned the first issue performancebut there are there's also the other onewhich is quality in factand quality is very thatthat's a full topic because how do youknow what is quality that's uh thatespecially with Vector searchhow you qualify what is good becauseeverything can beeverything can can be retrievedso that that's under the benchmarks wediscussed about thatearlier but the benchmarks are sometimesnotmore for the keyword search than forVector search so how do you compare thiskind of benchmarks and so on so but theyknow that it can be better because forinstance they detected they had plentyof such results with no results on theirsiteuhan examplecoming for my demos becauseas soon as I installed with it on mydemos I wanted to test some some crazyideas like so on the 2000 productswoocommerce demo I try things likesomething to sleep onobviously if you try that with a keywordsearch you have no resultsuh if you try uh in Cross domain acrosslanguages alsoso you have you have a sharper inEnglishif it's in English it's not too badbecause people willwill try to search in English let's sayyou have awoocommerce in France in Francebut you'd like to uh benefit fromcustomers all over the worldso you you can't ask your customers toand your site is in French in French youdon't want to translate it you have tolet's say you have 100 000 products youcan't translate themso youyou don't want to require your futureclients to search in Frenchso what you need is a cross-languagesearchandthat's that's a magic part of Victorsearch for instance the fact that themodels have been trained like coursemodels on the 100 plus languagesthat means instantly you open to thewhole world without doing anythingthat's that's a bit crazy in fact whenyou say about it you don't you didn'tyou didn't translate your siteuh you didn't do anything specific youdidn't create several indexes withseveral tunings for the limerizers thestemmers or the synonyms and so on it'suh it's done for you so that's uh uh sothe trade-off is that it's verydifficult to measure in terms of qualityumbecause uh models are very imaginativesoso the examples I gave you uh I testedI was so happy of the results I've putthem on my own page so some screenscreenshots so something to sleep on andobviouslyexcept in one case it was first resultwas matricesand for the sentence Transformer from agame face quite basic it was a secondresults not so badthat was the first result no problem atalland for I tested tocross languagesand that's athat's quite amazing in factyou you have your catalog in English andyou I tested in Chinese I don't speakChinese so I use the first translatorwhich is an AI too uh to translate myquery and use it after thatChinese I tested French obviouslySpanish and it worksso yeah I'm sorry it works it works it'sso difficult to say yeah of course youjust urge testing the tip of the icebergso does it work so well for all yourcoppers and so on that'sI I don't know if it's even possible butit it works that's quite impressiveyeah I think I think a really greattransition from like you know into thiskind of search engine stuff and like allthe models and this emergence of likezero shot models and how it's reallycrazy to me like kind ofstudying machine learning seeing howlike machine learning models are nowjust being like plugged intoapplications I mean this trend we'vebeen like covering it quite heavily Ithink we did but yes the the llms becomea community that's uhnotice that something which nobody couldforecasttwo years ago even one year ago probablyand it's it's uh speaking up you see allthat companies who are nowproviding the Frameworks to build yourown and train your big language modelslike Mosaic ml for instance and otherall Frameworks like aware anddistributed computing and so on so uhthe issue is of course uh that remainsTechnical and that remains very costlybutwhen you compare what we were readingespecially I guess for you becausethat's yet your topicwhat is ml three years ago ml that wasokay first linear regression thenthings very simple in fact and today weare talking about NLP about decisionTransformers the click models and thenuhthis model which have become uhcommodity and now are delivered uh touse for API thewall throw thanks to the game face andand other solo download and you caninstall themthrough token and an API in widget allthrough all the real mode the real thedocker model let's say the docker modelin widget in your kubernetesthatno nobody could have imagined thateven we get two years ago I guessI remember the first models that we getwere that were just before theTransformerswe get as at its own models I don'tremember the names in four or fivelanguagesuh and that that was impressive becausethat means that they created them bythemselves and and so on and just asafter that yes the community arrivedwith Transformersthanks to a better computabilityparallelism andand the big big text who entered thedanceand now yes you can consume them that uhI'm myself I'm surprised when uh I'm onmy widget cluster on theat each newuntil now at each new version of who yetI just updated my my configuration of uhkubernetes to update to the latestversion of widgetand uh activate a new feature like forinstance recently the pump 2 uhnowuhreranka with square or rianca with aTransformer models andit seems that every week I can activatesomething new that's athat's almost so reala bit too uhtoo good to be true in fact there mustbe some Traders somewhereI guessyeah well I think I think like just likewith the like the the quality of deeplearning models is accelerating so fastit just like you said it's almostunbelievable like I think you know thetime of recording this podcast we nowhave the Llama to open source languagemodel they're claiming that's you know Ipersonally haven't had the chance yet tosee to query it a little bit but likeyou know just you know from MPT 30billion like this now we've got Cloud100K getting stronger yes and everybodyand everything is it seems that butthat's the that's history uh everythingis is going to open source now so umwe had models which were closedbehind the Napierafter that we had models which were uhuh available downloadable but with somecompromise on on the on the open sourceversion okay it's open source but notcommercial and certainly it seems nowthat uh noperhaps not fully but uh at leastpartially and it seems that everythingis going uhis going thereyeah I think I I listened to so Bobrecently uh was at Arthurum speaking with Harrison Chase fromLang chain and uh you know uh a coupleother people and but like um Bob hadthis new thing where he's talking abouthow you need to make the models statefuland I think this is really interestingabout like retrieval augment togeneration and like Bob compared uh likemodel weights to like MP3 files and youknow with music and saying that like ifyou just distribute it there's no likevalue capture compared to kind of thisnewer generation of like the valuecapture is in making it stateful and itlooks like with retrieval augmentedgeneration like I think that's a reallystrong argument for how you would dothatyes that's uhthat's something which is interestingbecauseuhhere we'll okay so we will talk about uhI think which is aI understood recently which is awhich was a bit strange for me comparedto my experience but it's a humanexperience so Humana uh I must be wrongin fact so you have a just a teeny rawvision and you don't see what is thefull spectrumbut most we discuss about that and theum most Benchmarkshowed and are still showing that bm-25so keyword searchis stillin competition with a large languagemodels or any module in facton General copies of course uhand no no in fact it's even better onthe specialized copiessofor me that was difficult to understandI guess for all the small all the peoplewho are either not interesting At All bywhat is behind the Vector search ornot not really technical or are notreading papers and so on that becausewhenwhen I first try my uh my demos with athing like thatuh something to to sleep onobviously thatit tilted as a okay that's far greaterthan the bm25 which is a standard forall such uh search engines now uhbut it's notif if you produce a real Benchmark witha lot of data and on different areas andso onDem 25 is still is still very good sothat comes to your question about therag and and so on it'sthe fine tuningso the fact that you're able to adapt infact youryour model to something specific thatcould beat several atseveral levels it could be okay I willspecialize it for medical for e-commercefor instanceI will say or it could could be evenmore specific I will adapt it to mywebsite in fact uhI don't know if in a website there'ssomething so specific as auh products which has never been seenanywhere else during training of anylarge language modelsbut so fine-tuning was the first ideaso fine tuning is ofunfreezing or some fewsome some few levels of uh at thebeginning where the ordn and retrain alittle bit with a few shots and so onbut with arag in fact it's a prompting engineeringbut rather thaninjecting your your prawn from yourhuman brain in fact you are injectingprompts from your databasebut what was missing until recently uhwas a Vector Researchbecause you have a question you want toretrieve the project some data for someproducts for instance let's say that youwant to to use rag for producing recipesso you have a site with a plenty ofwoocommerce was plenty of foodvegetables meetanything and some some money is lookingfor for some kind of pasta and you wantto produce some recipesso you have to from the query you haveto retrieve your products butif you and then you with your productsyou will send it to a Netherland to tobuild your recipesor anything elseso generative AI the problem is if youdon't have a vector search which isintelligent enough to retrieve the rightproductswith what we said the efficient we canbe named by many names souhuh let's say you you name a specificfeature you don't have it in the in yoursitewith a traditionalsearch unless you have a long listthousands or tens of thousands ofsynonymsfor instance the names in Latin forinstance of all the fish in the worldlet's say that those 10 000 Latin namesare equal to fish okay that's only forofficial you have to do the same thingfor the mushrooms there are probablythousands and so on and so onwhereas you can expect from on the Shelfwhich is used byfor instance by widget you will be ableto retrieve with the name of a fish youwill be able to retrieve another fishthat you have in stock for instancecurrently and you can extract that andput it in yourprompt for generating your recipe forinstanceandso both are required in factbut both are the sameas the same the two faces of the samecoin because behind the scenes we wehave a model we have bird we have GPT wehave these kinds of Transformers in factand they are really converging no to behonest until now I didn't so will yetprovide the three generative modelsthree generative apisriddles I think in the nameuh I didn't have a usage right nowI had a customer interesting recipes andso on but uhit'sit's not obvious toto go from the idea to to start in factso the recipes could be a a good a goodpoint butI'm sureusers will have plenty of ideas and ifwe're talking about that but uh the nextTrend or two and perhaps that's thefuture of search boxes are chatbotswhat the first search box on the websitejust written just returning a list ofresultsan advanced search box is you have alist of suggestionsthat appears more or lessmore or less complicated intelligent forinstance proposing a list of similarkeywords or similar results and so onbut you can imagine to replace that byyour chatbot so instead of having adummy search box with dummy suggestionsyou could have something not to checkboth something kind of represent a chatbox is it's a ragwith a workflow of course so youmentioned mentioned launcher it can bein the main index and so onuh but the idea is the same and thatcould be interesting yes what isinteresting is that you you could havedifferent search boxes on your pages andone for recipes for instance and the WsWP server can do that very easily so youyou can have several configurationavailable and you could put for instancecreate an index with a clip search andone with aan open AI search and one with asentence Transformer from again phaseand mix it with the differentgenerative AI apis provided by or modelsprovided by we get a mix and match forinstance soacquirevectorizer with a palm 2 generativeresult for the recipe or the opposite oruhthere are so many possibilities now onthe listgoes and so in what part of your siteyou will have this search works aboutrecipes and another part will be anotherThird Watch about traveling for instancebecause the parameter chat box is it ithas to be super intelligent you haveonly one interface for everythingso usually what is done is that youcreate intenseso you define intents in your chatbotone is for recipe so you define a listof sentences that makes the intent ifhe's talking about fish is prob it'sprobably hey everyone knows sorry aboutthat we had a connection crashunfortunately um yeah so Patrice youjust taught me a ton of things I have somany notes written down with sort ofdifferent topics that we're goingthrough I mean I guess uh I don't wantto like we're I think we're recentlytalking about like search boxes and kindof the user interfaces and how that'sinnovating you know things like typeahead search where you propose a queryas you're searching and or or interfacesto propose multiple queries off all thisis just really fascinating I thinkuh yeah I think there's a company calledversel that's building like a lot of uisthat people plug in with these kind oftools it's definitely an emerging spaceum there was one thing that I you knowand then we talked about like retrieveaugments generation tooling and finetuning butthere is one idea in there that I thinkis really fascinating very early is wewere talking about like BM 25 being astrong Baseline compared to Vectorsearch and I think there is a newargument around that that I think isreally interesting is like right nowwhen we think about retrieval augmentedgeneration we're thinking aboutsearching finding text putting that textin the input and then just that inputgoes to the Transformer but the the nextgeneration of these Transformers I thinkyou're going to take the the searchresults and you're going to put them inthe middle of the Transformer so saylayer 8 out of 12 is where you injectembeddingsand so in this sense it's likeembeddings are truly kind of I thinkthat's just a huge argument for Vectorembeddings particularly that's like thethe encodile decoder scheme in factthe victors of the encoder that go inthe middle of somewhere if I remember ofthe decoder GPT modeloh yeah yeah II'm sure people will not stay at uhat this level and I will try to toovercome this uh those limitations onthe uh that it was it was more uh thatuhwhen I when I read the the it was avideo I think from meta rankuh they had but it was a great videowith a presentation uh at darling Bellsas if I remember and they had plenty ofuh uh they had plenty of benchmarks theymade with the with their tooling andthey've tried everything if I BM 25alone uh Beyond coder alone Bianco doorplus cross encoder a different type ofcross encoding hebrewed mode and so onand so on and with athe big test uh with hundreds ofthousands ofpredefined uh testsit was better but not not so much infact sowhen you looked at the slides you cannotbelieve that how much I fought you youhad to put on on your vector searchcompared to the few percentage you couldyou could gain and uh that was a bitsurprising but after all uh BMW 35 hasbeen made for that they've been chewedforfor 20 years so we just at the beginningfor for Vector search and and the NextGeneration and hybrid mode as you saidthere will be other hybrid mode we can'teven imaginenow uh that that another partinteresting which is a re-ranking forinstancethat's that's a big Trend I guess nowuh so we just enter residentsuh with two or two ways of re-rankingwhich I implemented now in WP serverandit was pretty pretty good in factand the very interesting thing is thatthe cross encoder which is the secondpart isnot very expensive when as a secondphaser you just have to re-rank 10a few a few results and Isurprisingly it's almost uh you don'tfeel thethe labsit's as as fast as it would so thedifficulty being the same that means howyou evaluate in fact your your resultsapart from a few tests you made manuallyyou have you are you are a woocommerceowner so you know what are your bigqueriesuh so you immediately uh you test youtest thembecause they are your best sellers soyou testimony leave that okay if onlyone of the time of your best salad isnot good uh I don't want that that'sthat's the test basically forfor small business to me to uh to meetbusiness and that that's also aninteresting interesting subject becauseif I remember your your post podcast uhmostly it's aboutsomething which is uh people you youwere talking about with it's aboutCustom Custom Solutionsuh so more I hand the marketwhich is completely different from fromthe smaller small businessso for this kind of um Market I handlethere's no question because they haveall the infrastructure all the resourcesmoney and people and consultants and theevent that probably the higher peoplefrom with yet from uh from the AIcommunity and experts on Bianca and soon uh but that's not a question at allwith uh with WordPress and thewoocommerce it could be because they arevery big uh sites and biggest in theworld which are WordPress or woocommerceso even if it's woocommerce or WordPressthey don't really care about the it'snot an issue for themI mean for the selfowners and and so on so in that sense uhit's a it's a bit a new subject I guessfor for for widget uhand I don't know what is the levelcurrently of democratization ofof a vectors suchI know on my side people are interestedbut uhit's always with some is it not toodifficult but it's the same thing aswith the elasticsearch a few years agofor instancenow a lot of agencies for instance oragencies are very used to useelasticsearch and Apache solar forinstanceuh less forhosting vector or databases oruh installing and so on so they have tore do this the thing to retrain and uhand uh rebuild a new service in factfrom from scratch uh there are somesimilarities but I don't think you cantest for instance if they had somebenchmarks or some tooling for uhverifying that for instance you didn'tintroduce a regression when you modifytheparameter in several parameters inelasticsearch for instance with learningto rank or modify the two parameters inthe M25 for instance uhthey have some tooling for thatbecause as I said you don't want forinstanceresult disappear completion from yoursearch for a Photoshop so probably itwill be a new kind of tool that uhnot sure I've seen them until now thethe toolsled to for instance to do a btesting for instance how do you do happytestingyou have elasticsearch and you want tocompare to uh to a widgetI I had to do that with a with somecustomers and as I told you the test wasvery simpleuh I remember when owner was able toproduce a long list of excel withqueriesand I took them one by one and comparedin several search boxes and this modelcompared to this model because even withyet it compared several vectorizersuh on the chose one but it was reallysomething onand the head of the search not on thetailorso for the tail I don't know how testcan be done andbut the mostsensitive is a headache if you modifysomething and your head disappearsyour shop loses 30 percent of theso that that's important so tool toolingis something that I'm not aware untilnow or I'll be testing or testingprobably the uha trade-off thing that will appear inthe next future when agencies will bemore familiar with the I think they arefamiliar but I'm not sure they areuh at least for mid-market but not smallbut foreign market I'm not sure agenciesarereally ready now to to use Vector searchcompletely for these reasons forinstance how can I you guarantee a honorthat uhit will not suffer from the new searchfor instance that's that's difficult toto evaluateyeah I think I think the big theme Hereis like vector databases versus searchengines and and like when you hearVector databases you might think that wejust mean Vector index plus databaseCloud that kind of thing but we alsocares enormously about this searchengine kind of part of it as well and umyou know like I'm so happy to hear thatyou're liking the re-rankers and you'regetting use out of it and you know we'vehad all these great conversations youknow mentioned Roman for meta rank doingincredible work and I I think there arecurrentlytwo only two Vector search is availableto to do ranking and re-rankingand eventually ranking and so on sothat's that's at the very Forefront uhafter the tunability and and so on thenumber of parameters that you could useperhaps that will be important also inthis becausewas very challenging with Vectordatabase is the fact that it's not uh orsearch it's not opinionated so even forme uh for the clip model which one willwill I use for instance I haveabsolutely no ideawhich one to usethere's nothing that tells you that uhthis model with this number ofparameterswill be better than this one and thewill it run correctly on CPU versus GPUuntil now for I I could make everythingrun on the CPUs and so that's that'sgood newsbecause I don't have to index millionsor billions ofbecauseoften I see for vectors for Vectordatabase of searchcomparison Benchmark for okay we haveanother Benchmark for one billionvectorsthat purely informativeprobably if you you don't have so manyvectors A few thousand for for shop forinstanceyou you can you can survive on CPUthat's interesting we're not sure beforeI was not sure before in factI've already already read that UnitedGPU somewhere without gpus you werealmost deadand in fact it's not so bad of course ifyou have a thousands of images to indexwithwith a clip modelit will take some time but not no okaycustomers six thousand images and uhI want them it could be it could be slowin fact it was surprised it was prettyfastuh and I didn't have to tweak a bit withyet uh kubernetesyaml files to to put the clip on GPU forinstance soI think that there were a lot ofprogress also in that uhin that areawhich makes in fact the models usablefor for smallfor small configuration of machines andas an example so if you use a thekubernetes cluster not to pylon mode I'musing Google Cloud it could be anotheroneit's really under uh I'd say 60 dollarsa monthand on my demos uh on my demos havepretty much everythingin that we'll get uhin the view we get to link so I have onit I have a clip several vectorizers thethe RPI vectorizers likeand so onuhthere is even the croissant colorre-rankerandI I had no problemso I I don't say that I could sustain Idon't know in fact I could sustain 1000queries per second or ten thousand I Idon't know but for let's say a demo andsomethingpretty standard for business smallbusinesses it's ait's surprisingly uhchip the only part which is not cheap isinstalling it because you need to tohire someoneI'd adopt a shop owner will be able toto install thekubernetes cluster it's not difficultbutyou don't want to do itso in that case the best option is weget customer servicesand this one is really cheaper than I'veseenbut yes you it's it's not what Iexpected a few months ago you can go forit and it's not it's even comparable tosome of those things for elasticsearchor if you Auto host your self-host youryour widgetuh I did not until now I did not needthe gpus or anything like that or gpusor other exotic Hardwareyeah I think um well I guess like kindof separating to like coming back to thehardware topic I think the like how youmentioned like wanting to Benchmark andcompare different embedding models Ithink it's such an interesting emergingpart of the kind of Technology it'sobvious it's obviously like you knowacademic machine learning people almostthink of that like first thing is howare we going to test and compare themodels but like kind of like I used tolike like I like this idea a lot oflarge language models generate syntheticqueries and that gives you a data set tocompare models with with like ndcgscores and recall all that kind of stuffI'm starting to also like the idea oflike cluster visualization like whereyou use something like nomic Atlas tolike visualize your embedding space andthen you can look at the embeddingspaces of two models and you can see thelike topic uh labels and say like okay Ithink this one is organizing the spacebetter than the other one but it is sointeresting and it's so interestinghearing you as Olivia users say thatthis is where you think the productneeds to evolve into to kind of completethe search engine tooling but yeah so sothen into the hardware kind of topicit's it's workflowI'll do well I think it could besurvivable but uh the workflow is prettycomplex so if we're talking yes uh theidea would be that we would like towe would like to fine tune that ideallywe would like to have our modeltruly adapted even at the if if possibleuh even at the vocabulary level uhlet's say I'm a pharmaceuticalpharmaceutical Pharmaceuticalshop selling drugsand I have some pretty specificvocabulary I'm not sure if you use a lotof language model which has not beentuned on you will be able to raiseanything the bm25 will be fineexcept if you're searching by formulas Iguess like you then you you countI mean really symbolic like equations orsomething like thatbut the M25 would bevery good I think in that case becauseuh the more specific the vocabulary thebetter it isso there you need to to train it but asyou said there are two ways to plenty ofWest but uh two ideas of training eachone isit does manage by itself you have aworkflow you have a website you click ona button and somehow again the idea ofmagicis that youit's difficult because you don't havethe the benchmarks how you will youevaluate that you've produced somethinginteresting that's uh we'll we'll talkabout T5 and so on for instanceand the other way is you mentioned beingable to to see the vectors clusters andso on but that requires expertise thatwill use you have an internal team or aConsultantsand uh it's it's a it's a bit uhthe same thing as for uhelasticsearch or sorry you haveConsultants which are here to evaluatethe unit synonyms for instanceyou will evaluate your your vocabularyand you'll see okay there's there's acluster here around the fishuh I I would like to have a little bituh 10 000 Latin name for fishes herearound thatand they tell you you have to producethem so fortunately you have aconsultant who has thisso with the vectors that's a prettysimilar in fact it's another toolingit's another competence but you have toCluster in fact your data but thatrequires money and time and so that's asolution for me as I understandfor more high-end or top of the midMarketum the solution I can foresee is the oneyou mentioned that means syntheticqueriesso the idea I've seen it several timesin papers that'sso interesting that I tried to imaginethe workflow so the idea is ahow do how do you Benchmark somethingwhen you you don't have benchmarks infact so you have to produce yourbenchmark what do you have currently youhave your shop who is a let's say a 100000 productsbut you don't have the queriesor if you have the query that perhapsthey are not so good because they comefrom uh the analytics and we know thereare biases with that you will see onlythe the head queries and not the tailqueries for instance oh yeahum so we we would like because it's alearning to run problem it's a verystandard in the search but you need toproduce three plates of query productso it can be titled descriptionattribute but product and positive andnegative for instancebut how to do that without the thebiases ofof user events user signals and the ideawas as you mentioned let'smake a general generative AI modelGeneral requires from my documentsso from my products what let's say Itake the titles if they are importantand I have a title about the fishesagain and I ask a G5 model or othermodelsuh uh to generate one or several queriesfor me and then I usea vector search to find among theseanswers which are the the bestso I literally I take the 10 queries forinstance and the query one does itreturn what I want to create two and soon and let's say the two or three firstare positive and the other ones arenegativeand then I train across encoder with allthese tripletsand I use a widget will ranker on mytrain encoder and that's itbut it's Iprobably the problem will not be thehardware in that case it will be theworkflow in factas I said for small business or let'ssay WordPress you don't have a fancyHardware at this position and so and soyou will probably be to have somesomehow request around so perhaps youcan reuse them okayI'm a bit cheating because in fact yesyou already have a cluster because youneed wheel yet solet's say if you don't use widget onstate servicesum you already have a cluster so perhapsyou can use this cluster to install yourtraining andwith tools like a Vertex AI for instanceso I don't know or again Facebook or notagain Facebook to ml and auto trainingthings are similar and uhthat would be incredible becauseimagine imagining that you have a bigllm that a croissant color that will betrained from your dataand re-injected theautomatically on a unfold 10 eurosthat theuh what I'm not sure is if it'sif it's really worth it in terms ofqualityapparently I've seen some Benchmark itwas prettypretty good but is it better really thanthe bm25 if you vocabulary verydedicated I am I'm not sureyeah well I think um well if BM 25 isalways your Baseline it kind of likewhat you said your example of somethingto sleep on right like that's just itkills that I mean I know you know whenwe talked last when we previously talkedyou mentioned how a lot of Amazonproducts they might have like sleep inthe title because yeah yeah yeah yesbecause uh indeedwe talked about that Amazon released afew months ago yes I think it's anAmazon uhsome a lot of data about query evenqueries plus results and results aretitles if I rememberwith with the notation uh positivenegative orand it appears that that was analyzed Iremember now that was analyzing The Metawrong paperand they they found that if you look atthe titlesthey have been optimized it's it's sothat there's so muchcompetition at Amazon that the titleshave been optimized so thatthe all the product descriptionattributes and all the products in inthe titleso the ones which are important so ifyou know that uh your fish people aremostly buying fresh fish you will putfresh fish in your title and uh and notjust fishand that could explain why perhaps bm25is so good because if if everythingis prettypretty done in fact for bm25 adapted tobm25 uhuh but as soon as you imagine that youhave synonyms and so onuhand you have a data model a model thathas been trained on that kind of thingwell it's it's difficult to to set sothat's an interesting idea of the factthat uhwe've yet Perhaps not itself but the theecosystem of widget could be recursiveand be used to retrieve the relevantdocuments from the generated queries andthat is reinjected in the bien codernthe bien color is used in in widgetuh I I don't know if we yet uh someideas about that that uhthat could be that could be uh thatcould be interestingbecause I'm sure that what we get iscurrently releasing like uh re-rankinguh generative and so on was not in theplans even uh one year ago because itdidn'tbecause llms were not a commodity at thetime so perhaps this kind of thing theauto training and auto fine tuning andso on[Music]I agree the problem is thatthere's not a single method to do to doit andtomorrow there will be perhaps a betterway to do it it will be done in themodel itselfOpera there will be a million modelspre-trainedavailable so you don't have to do itthere will be probably modelspre-trained and Fishes so you don't haveto do it yourself and and soyeah I guess three things out of that Imean like let me let's I'm going to comeback to stay on the fine tuning butquickly the um like building on youmentioned that Amazon people optimizethese titles really interestingly I justwant to share a quick nugget that youknow mod hub from Shopify when hepresented at odsc in Boston he told meabout how they use uh generative modelsto help people write titles for theirShopify products so like you know a lotof Shopify is just like everyone acrossthe world selling their stuff and theydon't think to write their titles likethis so this is that generative feedbackloop thing that we talk about and youknow like once once llms the inferencebecome so cheap I think it can't be youknow I it's going to be exciting howmuch llms can like augment titledescriptions right like just theexplosion of content in themiscellaneous ways that takes shape andin this example do you remember if uhwas it mentioned if it was more for SEOand that means for attracting newvisitors or more forCTR orconversion CRT conversion rate uhthat means is there some user signalsinside or not because if you generate aperfect because a perfect SEO uh titlecould be a perfect loser in terms ofconversion soif you if you because to attract toattract uh visitors generally you haveto be really on the marketing sideyou have to run face emphasis andsometimes exaggerate the features butwhen you want to sell it so the visitoris there on your site and they have toto buy it if the if the product is notreally like in the description describedin the titleor justthe Wonder contact set a neat titlebecause he has to to provide somethingwhich is close so can't accept anythingso soShopify introduce some kind of uhsignalsin the training for instance of themodels anduh well I don't know details like thatmyself but yeah I just know that highlevel nugget just and yeah like it wasmore yeah like so yeah I don't have toomany of the details of exactly just likesomething I heard in conversation thatis just like uh related to our topic oflike optimize these titles and yeah Idon't but yeah what you mentioned aboutusing the CTR and all that could bereally it's kind of likeit's kind of like the the wholeinstruction tuning and then like theidea that like right now we're tuningthese language models with just thisinsanely broad did you like this did younot like this but you could like you canfine-tune language models with like anylike I think the thing about it is anykind of what we used to call supervisedlike like how we used to think aboutsupervised learning loss functions allof that can just be applied to the endand you know it sequences sequence withthe re like even though it'sreinforcement learning it's still kindof the same you don't like superviseevery step of the generation but youknow see you could optimize llms to doCTR it's just the optimizationcompletely makes senseIndia so but but the what the othertopic about about like trainingembedding modelsand ranking models with just a singleclick where you spend ten dollars andnow you have a new modelI think it's just like one of the mostfascinating things about technologycompanies is like this what do you buildversus who do you partner with and Ithink all of that is it's just likeincredibly unclear to me at least like Iknow obviously Bob probably has like areally like a better sense of that thanI do but like this kind of thing of likeokay are we a model training company nowand like do we then split our attentionbetween like the vector index thedatabase scaling and you know andintegrating search apis to now alsothinking about like how do we optimizemodel training workflows and it's like II kind of feel like there are so manyparts of this like ml Ops picture that II I think there's a lot to be said tothe value of companies focusing onparticular things but then like whatthings merge together over time is likeit's so confusing yeah you have to beyour opinionated uh so there are on themarket some closed uhsearch solutions for for shoppinguh with sometimes with aplugins for woocommerce for instancewhich have this kind of loop in fact butthere's this kind of loop because theyare chosen and trained one model in factso it's a customer wants something elseor if it doesn't fit really or perhapsthere's a kind of mismatch between hisvocabularies is the content of his siteand their models what happened in thatcase and it's usually the it's a it's itcan be pretty pretty expensive butwhich can be explained too because ifyou have to train and[Music]and but we see in terms of search now wesee a convergence that's clear aconversion between search personalizedsearch and recommendationsthe three uh the three now the three arelinked forever I guess and uh so we'veseen uh with electricity search we'veseen training on learn to rank there aresome extensions that in order tointroduce uh to introduce signals in thein the models you have reworkersexternal internal uh there are internalreunctions with some plugins meta rankis an example or okay you you get yourresults and then you send it to anexternal system to re-rank with a modelwhich is costly so you don't want to useit in phase one uhuh so that that's really and and it'snot onlyfor recommendation it's forif if we imagine a site like Amazon isclear you you need to have a good searchyou need to have no no result that meansyou always have to produce somethingperfect for Vector search it's so it'salmost impossible to have nothing withthe vector search if you have a bigcatalog you always have somethinguh but you have to have personalizedresults soI've bought that so I'm probably moreinteresting in that thing that clusterof vectors than this one and yourrecommendation which are not ready to toyour search it's just uh on the bottomand the right okay you you could addthat too and and the three aredefinitely definitely linkeduh today and and Vector search is afinally in fact is is a part of thatit's a contentbut there's plenty of signals arrivingthe problem for me againfor more than two years this idea to tointroducepersonalization and the recommendationin WP server the problem is that youneed signalsand if I remember for certain providersof recommendation engine and soilsometimes you need for for one forinstance you need two million events inthe last three monthswhich is absolutely ridiculous for asmall business that will not have thatin 10 yearsuhuh and that's probably the limits ofthese systems it's ait's the marketuhis it really that's why I'm really I'venot done it becauseI met prototypes and so on but finallyuhare these recommenders uh effective forsmallera small website in factuh do you need Android thousands tens ofthousands and uhother signals to to use it andsearch engine recently announced thevector searchI went to there I went to their site andI read the documentation and in fact tohave the vector search you needed tosend user eventsthat means either you have keywordshelloeither you have a vector search but youneed to introducebecause probably that's this merging forrecommendation for personalization youneed to have events and finally in factyou are using Vector search to uh tohave a better contentyes better vectors but you you have tofunction them with your your events sosome have already chosen to to mergeeverything and some are not evendelivering in factare not even delivering a vector searchwithout the event and another example orthat you could soprovider providers reads or vectorsearch recommendation andpersonalizationbut some features are not available ifyou don't send the user eventsfor instance the subjectionsyou're starting to type something andyou want a list of keywords similar youcan't have them I don't know why youcontact them if you don't send usereventsso that's a feature for instance youprobably that will never be in Adobesalary because there's too many too manyevents that are required to do that andand in that two cases it's it's a bitstrange for me to understand why Vectorsearch is so merge with uh with eventsthat in fact you can't produce onewithout the otheryeah interesting I mean I think umyeah he well I do think with the zeroshot model like I I also used to thinkthis way that I couldn't imagine likehaving a vector like a latent space in adeep learning model without some kind oftraining on your data but now clearlythe zero shot models from like open AIcode here they clearly get you like someof the way there but the question I meanclosing the loop with the fine tuningyeah it does all sound so interestingand it's definitely interesting to seehow the you know how the whole Market ofall this is umyou know shaping out further well yeahawesome Patrice I think this was areally great coverage of all thesesearch engine topics and just gettingunderstanding what you're building thenuances of you know just getting intothe details of hosting and cloudservices and kubernetes and all thiscool stuff and then you know yourperspectives on search engines and howthe Market's evolving is just gold Ithink this is you know expert
