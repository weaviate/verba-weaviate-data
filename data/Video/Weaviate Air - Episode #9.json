{"text": "Multi-tenancy: https://weaviate.io/blog/multi-tenancy-vector-search Berlin Hackathon cool video: ... \nforeign[Music]this is going to be a record-breakingepisode we have Hall 8 beautiful peoplewith us here this is so much excitingyou can see Edward is super excited andthis is going to be super great and thisis going to be the final single digitepisode this is a very importantinformation because the next one will bea double digital oneum so with us we have like a reallygreat crew some new faces so you can seefor example hokun nesrin and Ricardo uhwho are our special guests who areparticipated in a really cool hackathonthat we organize in Berlin so they'll bedemoing some projects and you know theusual suspects you have done in JP whotalk to us about cool stuff and attendour CTO was like a cool announcement sothank you for spending your time and forwatching uh Vivid air like we're alwaysexcited to see you and uh to have youyou know be part of this shopum so thank you for watching andlistening and you know if you want tohelp us a little bit give us a like thatalways helps because then the video willpop up in more places and that alwayshelps it's always niceum but most importantly because you arewith us live what you can do that youcan't do when you watch it later is youcould ask questions right so feel freeto ask questions so as you ask questionsI will be sharing them with our audiencehere so whoever is talking about giventopic I can always ask these questionsto themum you know like keep it civil of courseright like I'm not going to ask two badquestions although like uh the same goeslike there are no bad questions juststupid answersum so that's it and um yeah superexcited to have you here so what are wegoing to talk about todayis first we open up with a multi-tenantupdate so uh next week Thursday we'reactually planning the next release forvv8 that which was going to be within120 and the multi-tenancy is a hugefeature for us uh so at the end it willtalk about itum I already mentioned the mlopshackathon that we did in Berlin so Iwould like to talk a little bit about itbut more importantly I would like toshare you know we would like to sharewith you the the winning three projectsuh so that's why we have our specialguests hereum then later on Edwardum our new arrival wait Edward I didn'tintroduce you right damn I'm so terribleyes Edward welcome Wentworth he's a he'sa new rifle oh my God I'm so embarrassedum maybe that's because you're a catperson I'm a dog person you know likeyou know that was on purpose uh but yeahEdward actually built a pretty cool demoand he really wants to share with usum and uh it's actually really reallyinteresting way of using widget as wellso uh we're happy to have you here uheven if I miss you to begin withum then we want to talk to you aboutthis new thing we introduced which islike the Vivid Forum leaderboard so forthose of you that are you know goodcontributors uh you definitely can seeyour name higher up and uh there's somerumors that I may be buying bottles ofnice things to people that uh you knoware tough contributors at the very leastyou know like if you stay serious I'llsend you like one of those amazing wavyt-shirts or maybe some other swagum JP would talk to us about the VividAcademy which is uh pretty cool and uhwho knows maybe you know if anyone likesmeerkats maybe somebody can help me namemy wooden meerkat because this is vasilihe already he has a name vasili or Vascoum but the wooden guy doesn't have aname yet so maybe we have time out yetso uh also drop us in comments uh say hilike say hi where you watch from or justask questions and I'm super pumped uh tohave you here and we already have thefirst comments uh from like some otherUsual Suspects of Conor packed house ofcourse go team go yeah thanks Ericaso without any further Ado I'd like tobasically pass on the microphone toatien uh and tell us what is this allmulti-tenancy about like why are we soexcited uh because like even like whenwe talked about it at first I was likeall right so what do we even mean bymulti tendency like why do we want thatso at the end the floor is yours yeah sothanks for for having me especially inthis packed episode I'll try to keep itshort and and also hi to Connor andErica who just popped up like usuallyit's the other way around they theywould say hi to me on the episode sothat's niceum yay okay hium so multi-tenancyand see one of those sort of veryspecial moments in VBA history I thinkwe we had a couple feature-wise wherewhereum we would introduce something new thatsomehow changes how you interact withvb8 or at least gives you the ability toto do new things with vv8 that youcouldn't do before and multi-tenancy isis one of them so first of all what whatdo we mean by multi-tenancy likemulti-tenancy in general is the the ideaof sharing some kind of resources formultiple tenants so the name isbasically likely would have maybe anapartment building and then multiplepeople would rent an apartment in thatapartment building they would be tenantsfrom the perspective of the of thebuilding owner and if you rent anapartment you have some strict isolationrequirements you don't want to sort ofshare your apartment with your neighborunless you maybe invite them over orsomething but in general you you likethat you can lock your door and you havethis kind of isolation uh requirementnevertheless some things in there areshared so for example the heating systemin the building might be shared and andum this is kind of what this is aboutlike making sure that um individualtenants have their own sort of their ownspace can do with their deal with theirown things but at the same time theystill live in the same building and thisis exactly the same kind of concept forVBA so for a multi-tenancy case youwould have a single vv8 cluster so it'snot single in a single instance but asingle cluster sort of a singledeployment for example if you sign up tothe WCS that would be sort of your yourbb8 instance and then you can hostmultiple tenants on there and a tenantcould be so so for example if your apphas let's say you have an app for notetaking and um your your users basicallywould be your attendance and it makessense that that unless serve usersactively share their documents if theysearch through their documents they wantto share when it searches with their owndocuments or the documents off their ownorganization but not like if we as abusiness the note taking app would havethree competing businesses like youdefinitely don't want those competitorsto be able to search through each eachother's documents so that's kind of theidea around multi-tenancy and this thisconcept of course is nothing new likefor a SAS business it's completelynormal to have multiple different usersand have these kind of isolationrequirements but the way that we coulddo this in vb8 is completely new becausebefore it's and now we can say thatbecause now we have the proper solutionbefore it was basically just work roundsyou could use this for example usingclasses because a class already is anisolation unit in vb8 so you could justhave one class per tenant and this isthis is the the approach that werecommended up until now works okaygives you the best sort of ofum yeah the best isolation requirementsand everything but maybe two to fivethousand tenants is the most that youcould run on a on a cluster and alsojust adding more notes to the clusterdidn't really help there because therewere sort of these Central constraintsbecause in the end it was just theworkaround but now with the nativemulti-tenancy feature uh we can actuallysupport millions of tenants and everysingle one of those tenants could ontheir own have millions of objects so sobasically it's easy to go into the thebillion or trillion scale of objects andstill keep these kind of isolationrequirements and something that'sextremely important and extremely coolabout this in in my opinion is the factthat you're sort of never locked in likeyou can dynamically grow your VBAcluster by simply adding notes or ifyou're on the on the VBA cloud servicethen you won't even know that thenbasically our system in the backgroundwill just add more notes you you won'tevenum won't even notice soum in our initial load test that we didI think we were able to to run 50 000tenants on a single note in the exactnumber that varies depending on how howum how much data you have per tenant umhow many fields how this is structuredet cetera there are basically a coupleof hard limits that that on somethingthat a single machine can host which issort of the whole idea of cloud anddistributed setups and sort ofhorizontal scaling and um yeah with with50 000 so you could keep this on asingle node as you grow your businessand onboard more users and then at somepoint if it's too much you just add asingle a second node and then you havemore capacity for another 50 000 and soon and this basically scales linearlyand that's that's extremely importantbecause that means sort of the whole vv8mindset already like if you look at ourpricing model for example that isalready a pay as you grow kind of modeland now we also have the architecturethat that works for that as well sobasically infinite scaling infinitelinear scaling with multi-tenancyum from a user's perspective super easyto use it's basically just one New Fieldthat is added that's basically just thename of the tenant which you wouldprobably have had before in in one wayor another anyway you would have maybehad a field in your schema and thenmaybe set a filter or you would have hada part of your class name so super easyto use everything will stay the same theonly difference basically is that andmulti-tenancy is opt-in so if you don'thave multi-tenancy case you don't haveto use it but if you do then you shouldspecify the tenant key and um yeahbasically use VBS as the the rest saysthe same so it'll be super easy to touse as well andum yeah it will scale very well with thenumber of tenants it will also the thekind of isolation this is somethingwhere a technical requirement and abusiness requirement or a functionalrequirement uh come together so forexample something that we hear very veryoften especially in in Europe or inJapan that also came up more but it'salso more in in the USum it's um so the Europe European in oneis a gdpr but other kind of isolationrequirements as well where deletionplays a big role so for exampleoff-boarding of of tenants and this issomething that that you typically don'tthink about in your business casesbecause you think about sort ofonboarding new users and you don't wantto think about losing them but one sortof technical case that we see very oftenis for example if you have a free trialum if you have a free trial that wouldexpire let's say after two weeks or sonow if you have a marketing event orsomething else happen or your app goesviral on social media and you suddenlyget a massive spike in signups that'sawesome so that's that's one thing thatmulti-tenancy can handle just add morenotes if you if you um if you can't sortof handle it with the existinginfrastructure but now out of thosemaybe tens of thousands of users thatall signed up on the same day that alsomeans their trial will all end up thesame day and well we of course wish youthat every single one of your free usersconverts into a paying user we know thatthat's not the case so within likeinsanely High conversion rate of 10 thatwould still mean that 90 of users areoff-boarded and this this sounds trivialthis sounds like okay then let's justdelete 90 but from a technicalperspective it's extremely important tomake sure that those 90 of usersdropping off don't have a negativeimpact on your paying and and stayingusers and this is something where if youif you don't have this kind of technicallevel isolation that can easily happenbecause in modern system deletes areoften just done using flags and thensomething else happens in the backgroundand you have these async processes toclean it up and that's actually verysimilar with Vector search as well sobeing sure that you can essentially sayremoving a tenant is as simple asdeleting a file from disk and then it'sgone that is super helpful from atechnical perspective but also for thesekind of compliance things like gdprwhere you maybe have to prove that if auser says I want all my personal datagone then you can prove that you can dothis in a certain time frame and that'sthat's sort ofum yeah to wrap up where it started itis one of those big features where somany things are coming together and wecan see this community demand so soshout out toum to yurai who was here on the on thedeviate air uh maybe he's watching if sohium who's here a couple of episodes agoum who had I think probably the firstmulti-tenancy case that that we wereaware ofum it come it came up very often in ourcommunity slack and now the forumsthere's like Hey how do I separate myworkloads for multi-tenancy so it's aclear sort of Community Driven one it'sof course also V8 as a business reviewit needs to make money so viviate alsohas commercial users this is somethingthat there comes up more and more and itcombines or if it makes sense from atechnical perspective and it allows forthese compliant things so this isbasically what I meant like somethingwhere everything comes together I'msuper proud of the solution that ourteam has built because it's somethingthat that scales very well that makessense that is very sound and so it'svery future proof for multi-tenancylet's sayniceum so just to wrap up as well like umwhat was like the main use case like isthis my idea of it was always like heywhat if I build a business and then likeI need to like have a separatecollection per customer or something isthat the idea why we need multi-tenancyor are there other use casesthat that is the the primary one likefrom the the technical infrastructureyou could use that for different thingsas well you could use it for example forsay in a Time seriesum when you say like you have data uhthat lives for or you you add data everyweek and you have a retention period of52 weeks you could basically treat thatas a multi-tenancy case you could sayone week as a tenant you have 52 tenantsand once you grow build it Beyond uh 52you just delete the oldest tenant sothat also allows for these kind ofthings but that they're more sort ofthat those are not the primary use casethe primary use cases are really as abusiness you have multiple users andthose users can upload documents orwhatever they have to deviate and itneeds to be isolated to them like youneed to make sure that user a never seesthe documents of user B and also itneeds to make sure that for example ifuser a has a lot of traffic and they'rehosted on the same machine that user Bstill has dedicated resources or stillhas has um sort of we can still keeptheir throughput up so that you havedon't have this kind of interferenceeven though they're on the same samesetup and of course also cost savingslike you could of course also say thatfor multi-tenancy what I could justdeploy maybe one BBA cluster per tenantbut just think of million tenants thenthen you're bound to have some kind ofoverhead and if you pull these thingsand still get the the isolationrequirements then or the isolationcapabilities then it's way easier to tosave on your infrastructure bill whichyou don't have to care about if you usethe vb8 cloud service but of course youcan also self-host it and then then youdonice niceum you have two messages from thecommunity first of all gift uh it saysgood to be here it's a gift to have youhere a giftum intended sorry I couldn't help myselfand uh Jurgen is saying yeah deletingspecific content is very helpful notjust per tenant though good to hearabout this feature so very nice thankyouum Also if anyone has any questions andnow is the time because I know Etienneis very busy and you have to disappearsoon so yeah any questions hereif someone wants to uh find out moreabout this feature is there a place theycould go to perhaps to get moreinformationthere is we've released a blog postum about a week ago and of course therewill be much more once the final releaseis out but for now basically the theteaser with a couple of more example usecases uh with with the kind of technicalfeatures like what makes the featuregreat from a technical perspectivethat's all in there soum yeah I think Sebastian will put thelink in the description that sounds soYouTubey the link in the descriptioncan I also ask for people to smash thelike button and subscribe pleaseyeah of course we should do it um so thelink I'm sharing here on the screen butthere's also in the description of thevideo uh you can find all sort of linksin there and this being one of them yeahso this was not a planted question notat allactually we didn't rehearse that sothat's fineperfect exactly perfectI see a couple of uh more uh responsesso I see gift I appreciate my my jokethat's very nice thank you and uh Ericaalready smashed it very nice withcapital letter so um I was like I shouldshout but I don't want to do thatvery niceum yeah this is awesome this is superexciting uh so my this understanding isthat this is going to be readywith innovate from Thursday next weekand in WCS do we know when this is goingto allow London WCSsame same day same day perfect same dayyes you'll be able to use it right awayand um if you have an existing uh umsort of running machine on on the WCSyou can just upgrade it using theautomated upgrade feature if you start anew one it will always start with thelatest version so you already have itand then you can add your multi-tenancyclasses by the way also in combinationwith non-multi tenancy classes so that'sand it also supports cross references sothere's there's lots of lots of sort ofthings that we have to think about butthey they will all workand if not then let us know then it willmake them worknice this is this is exciting uh reallycool and um also you can learn moreabout it in the blog post that we shareda link for but also if you're interestedin the 120 release uh JP and Dan herethey're actually working on the releaseblog post so that's also going to golive on Thursday so definitely check outour blogs pageum let me see if I can show a quickBanner for it so if you're new to vv8this is where all our blogs are come onshow itso uh definitely check it out onThursday next week but you should bechecking it every week anyway because wealways have cool awesome contentum perfect I don't see any morequestions for at the end uh at the endthanks for uh for joining us for thesession and uh for a great explanationawesome thanks for having me congrats onon episode nine on the ninth birthdayyeah the final single digit episode thefinal single digit episode I feel veryhonored to be part of this this finalsingle digit episodeyeah thank you says hiI'm not kicking you outall right on that on that note the nexttopic we have is the mlops hackathonthat we did last uh last week yeah thatwas last weekum in Berlin well depending how youmeasure time so basically this is thisis a pretty exciting things because thefirst of all there's this amazingCommunity called like the like the mlopscommunity uh and um I was talking toDemetrius who's like one of the foundersof that Community uh and we're like heyhow about we do some you know events andhackathons together and he basicallysaid that Berlin is a is an excellentplace to start because there's like someamazing engineers in there there's areally cool Vibe and who doesn't want togo to Berlin anyway rightum so we kind of spend some timepreparing it and long story short weended up with like um like a two-daysort of uh event where first day waskind of like hey let's meet and greet onFriday if everybody gets to know eachother you know get some pizza and stuffwe're supposed to have barbecue uh butit was raining like hell so we ended upyou know getting some takeout like adelivered Etc which is still cool likeeverybody you know had fun uh but thenon Saturday we hadif I remember correctly about 60 peoplethat were divided in I think 19 or 20teams uh hacking on various differentprojects and then by the end of the daywe had 19 submissions all built with vv8um like open air cohere and a bunch ofother things really cool ideas of those1916 were actually working demos whichwas pretty awesome uh there was fewdemos that didn't but you know that'spart of the game uh and then eventuallywe had like three winners uh threewinning teams so that's why we have hereuh Nazarene Hawken and Ricardo and whatI'd like to do is actually give them anopportunity to share their projects likeso maybe a quick intro of who they arewhat they build and then maybe demo whatthey didso we will start with nasrin uh Heynasrin welcomehey thanks for having meof course so you have project in itright what can you tell us about ityeah soum this project I did a coding assistantwhich creates code based on user promptand based on user-divid librariesbecauseI would data scientist and every dietevery day at my data science job I feellike I'm confronted to the new librarythat I need touseso I thought about creating this Goodingagent which uhtakes a library from from a user andthen creates code based on that libraryand alsothis is because current alarms like chatgbt and gpt4 and so on have been trainedon a pretty old Corpus and as we knowlibraries appear almost on a monthlybasis and these LMS can't catch up sothe idea was to providethese alarms with fresh documentationand to generate code code based on thatcool cool so uh should we share yourscreen and then you could run a quickdemo for us yesThat'll be amazing so here's your screenso walk us through uh through a demookay so let's explore the user interfaceso basically what we have here in themiddle is the uh the prom The Prompt sothe coding task that's going to be givenby the user and uh here we have thelibraries that are going to be used togenerate the code so in this project Ihave provided the VBA library and thelanguage chain Libraryand especially because link chain isquite a new library and you cannot findany uh support on that with uh currentllm modelsso you basically enter your codingprompt here and then click on generateand what's going to happen is that onthe left side you're going to see the uhthe plan for the codewhich is going to then betransformed into code that you're goingto see on the rightand this code is going to be executedand the error logs are going to be shownin this console in the in the bottom sofor example here I have this codingprompt using the link chain Library Iwrite code for an agent that givesweather information based on auser-diven cityand what I have here in the coding planis in the first line I always have theuh the dependencies that I'm going toneed for the project and I'm going tolater talk why why this is necessaryand then there's a generated plan forthis coding task so in the beginningdefining uh the theweather info functionusing the link chain library to createthis agentusing the agent to generate the queryfor the weather API and sending the uhrequest to the weather API and so on soit seems like a very reasonable workflowand we're going to see theumthe result of the coding agent here soit's going to import some libraries andit has this this code which wasgenerated based on the planand how this actually works is shownhereum so what happens is that theum the documentation for the librariesare downloaded as HTML and thesedocuments are parsed and chunked andembedded into uh in the Revelatordatabaseand when the uh when we get a codingprompt from the user this prompt is alsoembedded and then we do a semanticsearch and we retrieve the most relevantdocuments from the vv8 vector databaseand we give this to the planning agentso basically in this project there arefour agents which uh each each one ofthem is going to take care of a certaintasks so the planning agent is going togenerate the code planwhich is going to be given to adependency agent and as we have seen inthe plan if the first line is always theum the the libraries that need to beinstalled so the dependency agent isgoing to extract these libraries andthese are going to be then installedinto a virtual environmentthen this code generate the coding planfrom the planning agent together withthe context which is the relevantdocuments which we have retrievedare going to be given to a coding agentwhich is going to generate the code andthis code is going to be run into thisvirtual environment where we havealready installed the dependenciesand this code is usually going tocontain some mistakes so we will getthese errors and we'll give all of theseinformation the context on the sourcecode and give all that to a codecorrecting agent which is going to keeptrack of all of these errors and witheach iteration is going tocorrect the code and uhget the errors and so on and so acertain limit that is defined by theuser of coding attempts is reachedand we can see how this goesin action so I can give here a promptlike if you want to use the vv8 libraryI write codethat I meanabout documentsanduh queries and save themthank you very latebyqueriesumbased on the user accountsor maybe let's seewe've all been waiting for the live demothis is exciting yes uh so it it takes alittle bit of time because it's going togenerate a plan and then it's going toinstall the libraries and then it'sgoing to run the codebut actually if if you're lucky enoughwe can see how it is generatingdifferent versions of the code and sowhat we have here is on the left the uhthe plan and we can see here it importedthe Vivid client with this Dash and theerror is thatthis is an incorrect syntaxso hopefully in the next iteration isgoing to correct thatum issuethis is epic he's actually trying tofigure things out step by stepum just to add some encouragement lookslike Conor is very excited like a hugecongratulations this is the best exampleI've seen so far of this ideaum and uh if if you don't know ConnorConnor sees and knows everything that'sgoing on in the ml space so if hebelieves this is the best example Ithink this is this is a good uh messageto hearumthanks Amit uh we all think this ispretty awesome as wellyes so one of thenext steps for this so the problem isthat this is even though it's givinggiven documentation it's usually likehallucinates some of the module Importsand some of the functionum function parameters and so onso I'm currentlycreating so I I want to create a goodbase that is uh extracted a code-basedknowledge graph that is extracted fromthe library and that's going to be alsogiven to the to the agent so that theycan verify if the module Imports and thefunctional parameters and so on are allcorrect based on the not only on thedocumentation but also on the uh on thecode base from the librarynice this is cool and I have a questionbecause we have like uh at Vivi we'vecreated this repository of recipesum like unfortunately Erica is not onthe call but we have this like there's abunch of Jupiter notebooks is thatsomething maybe that you could ingest aslike hey here's a loads of examples onhow to do stuff with vgateyesI think all of these sources ofinformationare very valuableforfor the yeah that's a that's a greatidea and I've seen alsosome research that also take informationfrom stack Overflow andall examples so so for for the learningumfor for learning from a learningperspective I think that's very viablenice yeah because I guess the idea islike the more good examples we canprovideum to the machine right to figure outthe code the better and uh we canalready see Erica excited about thisidea right like uh and any place that wecould use recipes right Erica yeahso uh no that would be exciting I'lldefinitely I will definitely share withyou the links to the recipes if you wantto have like another iteration it wouldbe kind of cool to figure out how to doitperfect yeahJP yeah you're here you could also sayitso I didn't want to interrupt but butthose recipes are really really cool andI think uh people at the hackathon umreally appreciated having them to as astarting point and building on themobviously as wellthat's awesomecool cool I have one question fromConnor so I'm gonna move you higher sothat you're visible I'm not thatimportant so retrain from stack ofoverflow particularly for that codecorrect correcting agent party superinteresting curious how you are thinkingabout the wibit schema design for thisum sonot sure if you're an expert when itcomes to the Vivid schema I would sayum and that could be still a trickytopic I have starteddoing thecode base nowis a knowledge graph from a whole codebase where you can link the folderstructure and the modules and theclasses the functions and the parametersand so onandumthenthen these should be checked uh or theagent should be able to query those toverify the the module in person all thatkind of stuff but also how to uh how toinclude these examples from stackOverflow and everything what I've seenis that people use that information asdescription which they store for uh forthese different parameters and modulesand stuff like thatso that provides further information forum for the other oneI see that's interesting interestingyeah definitely a cool project toexplore deeper right and uh go go deeperinto it yeah cool this is uh this was apretty cool demo like I'm super excitedto see it uh running live and like thecode plan was updating I saw that thecode itself got updated as it went andthis this is super cool like we could doa whole episode probably on each of thedemos that we want to show todayum but yeah thanks for uh for this demoum this is super cool thanks for havingme it was such a great hackathon I mustsayyeah well uh next next academ we do likewe'll definitely be using one of yourlike your project and the other projectsas examples of like what to Aspire to soyeah thanks for setting the bar prettyhighcool so next up the bar is pretty highhokun uh you're the next one to talk tous about the project bgb for allyeahso let me want me to share the screenbut what's the project about what wasthe ideawell yeah maybe it's better that I sharescreen to to like introduce this ideayeah all right soyeah and hulkman I'm from Tio Berlin asa research associate I work here and ourteam basically incorporates threeforeigners who are no Germans and oneGermanso the problem we want to servebasically ishowwe can use large Bank mode and also workthe vector database vva to solveproblems which might be encountered byforeigners in daily lifeand this one comes into our site bgbwell probably you have no idea aboutthis one it's basically the civil codefor German for Germany andit has336 pagesand couple things about like uh thecontract issues from your sign contracthow should you end the contract orwhether your contracts illegal or notuh in order to understand this law youprobably need to read all the page whichis 300 andmaybe you are lucky that you cannotstand and solve your problembut it might be hard especially forforeigners we like me haveno much knowledge about Germanandbecause of the larger language modellike child gbt is very uh powerful atonstandingum this contacts howeverum to actually retrieve this knowledgethis alloy is not that easy therefore weuse vv8 to help us ingest those uhthis law by basically chunk this bookinto several uh small uh parts and thenwhen we ask a question about specificthings like uh our rent contract thenumthe our assistant will retrieve thecorresponding chapter from the bgb andthen summarize with the source to theuser so they can without reading thebook and understand the law and how theyshould reactso too much talk let's see how it workshey how can you doing great by the waylike honestly to me even if you have abook that is written in your nativelanguage like uh already that is adifficult hurdle to go and find theinformation like it's it's impossibleand then yeah I agree like if it's aforeign language that that's even worselike uh and me being polished living inDenmark right now I feel the pain youknow I know what you're talking aboutyeah thank you I can't I think manypeople can relate especially mycolleague today when he see uh so Ibasically tell about this uh podcasttoday and tell him the idea and hespecifically point out that I shouldemphasize that there are already 20 ofpeople in Germany are foreignersand probably most of themdon't have the native speaking abilityof German so yeah I think that's a bigdemandI think so yeah and and I also know thatGerman is quite bureaucratic right sothere's like not many ways around itlike you really need to know this uhthese rules and everything and beingable to find the information is justtoughso uh let's let's see what we can dobecause I've seen the demo live and Iremember I was super excited but uh yeahyeah let's see if it works this timeokaymy apartment without noticinginterestingyeah for example I'm quite curious aboutthis question like which might behaunted in our daily lifeand what is uh our assistant we dobasically is to retrieve thecorresponding paragraph from phb lawthis book and then uh Supply that to gbtfor API and then summarize with theinformation from the apgp and then withalso the sourceumso maybe we can just take a look insideto underhood we retrieve the law withthe the German translated but actually Ithink a good feature from Vivid is thatit has close language in bending whichmakes it possible even here we just uhquery with other language we can alsoget the uhthe relevant information we want okay wenow gather with that let's seeso this is impossible and we can getexact the paragraph in the bgb lawwhy it's not about and I think this isbetter than maybe just try and searchonline because yeah definitely peoplehave information about this but probablythey don't have exact paragraph to asite to useum to supportandas I just mentioned maybe we can youknow sometimes people are no good atEnglish we can also try using otherlanguageuh I'm from China by the way so I willjust use Chinese toask uh if it's possiblewell let me just paste it so here itmeans same thing as herethat I want to ask if it's love wellokay coolsince it doesn't work this time but youknow we have a backup so I asked thesame question hereand we also get the like the similaranswer uhand the themeis that it met with with uh English orChinese we can always get the answer wewantuh but probably for a user-friendlyconcern we can also like change thelanguage here to toum like user language and on the leftside I haven't introduced Adam this is acool feature uh developer and designedby Max one team member of usthat we uh specifically extract thequotes and also apply this translationhere and specifically this quote iscross verified from it to make sure thisis no hallucination for uh GPT formodels and wewe retrieve it directly from the vb8and yeah you wouldn't you wouldn't wantlike an advice from a hallucinationright like hey can my landrecords like hey if he needs to make themoney byeyeah exactlyyeah that's that's why we want to alsohave this whole featuresand in the future we would like yeahplease go ahead so so one thing thatthat I remember during the demo you didlike you also wrote the question inItalian and you got any response inItalian is that something you can stilldouh well yeah definitely but not thistime okay coolum I think uh I also tried to deliverthis feature as wellbut like I think some prompts need to belike optimized to have such stabilityyeah I think that's yeah that's alsowhat you want to achieve to adapt theanswer to use the language that would beawesomenice and and I interrupted you when yousaid that you had like some ideas forthe futureyeah exactly so in the future we wouldlike to open source our project and alsoprovide it for public use maybe also Ithink it would be very useful that weinclude other big law otherum regulations or things into thedatabase review it so that likefollowing us in Germany they can reallyanswer their daily questions maybe alsoupdate their own like contracts to seeuh if there are some like questions canbe answered alsoyeah that's like a cool idea if you opensourcing one day we could also worktogether on like a create like atutorial or something it could be a coolcollaboration I would love thatyeahyeah absolutely and uh to someencouragement so you can really likeyour idea uh you knowuh chatting with law content a dreamcome true for many have your personallawyer on your phone and ditch the realoneis laying dead on the bottom of the seaa good startniceum some of yeah Edward appreciate thejokeso that's Mark so yeahcool cool there's a question for you sohow did you split the book would you usesentences this is really a good questionI we actually in terms of issues when wejust read the book uh at the beginning Ithink we still just by the the newalliance mark and it didn't work welland at the end we just uh speedaccording to the uh the characters thechunk size I don't I think it's still uhum some experiments which can work hardto tune because uh it's uh splittingcould be quite an important thing for usto really retrieve the correspondinglike paragraphs so that the users leadon camera and also uh one thing andadding upon upon that is that I think weat the moment don't have the page orsomemetadat adding to this apart from thisparagraph and the later point I thinkit's also a good idea that we add suchmeta information such that uh the userscould really wrestle and close uh verifythe source of the informationnice nice yeah no this is this is coolthis is cool uh we should definitely uhcollaborate about on it in the futureumand uh like there's so many ideas interms of like how you can speed thecontent in a better way and and it'salways like depends on the on the usecase right uh so we even have a prettyinteresting blog post on like ingestingPDFs and that also talks about like howyou split different parts of the PDF andto put it into another lamp like throughan um so that's kind of coolcool yeahum yeahI think maybe I do actually an importantrole yeah because like all those booksare basicallywe need to be split into chunks so thatlater on we can really retrieve relevantdocuments for users to check and answertheir questionsyeah agreed a great thank you for thisdemo this was super awesome like um Ireally like how it is like hey it's notjust like hey he's a bit of data he'show we search but also like theapplication of it it immediatelyresonates for with anyone that had toleave abroad for a bit longer than youknow couple of months or holidaysum so yeah and then Mark agreesattribution of source is critical forlaw that's always important to be ableto quote where something comes fromperfect let's move to the final HighCaptain demo uh Ricardo you're up nextyou feeling readyyou're amused yes uh that's uh thenormal Mantra I still go to the officeand I ask my colleagues in front of themif they can hear meum so what's up people this is this isus right we I was joined by an amazingteam of colleagues from Colombia rightthe the place where we're born where welive our entire lives and then we movedto Berlin and we build this what we callcine scripture rightthere is a tool that we we wanted tocreate to enable the people to get thecontent they need when they need itabout the things they care right so letme send you an exampleuh we have a collection of the slackmessages right from the Emiratescommunitybased on that slack there is a bunch ofknowledge that people can easily accessright but sometimes it's just hard toget to it right it's hard to get to abottom of it it's really difficult manychannels many conversations manyinteresting things to see so why don'twe just create a tool that enables us tosearch throughout a amount of contenttechnical conversations uh interestingtopics and just get everything consumedin a single video that I can easily seeand be entertained with it right sothat's the idea behind what we doso what are we using for this rightum we were basically taking a takingadvantage of 11 laps to generate voiceright which is the the kind of the thingfor for boys generation text to speechgify because well we want to have fun onSplash we are to somebody right somedramatic viral in the video Open Eye ofcourse to generate the content vbaswhere we store the uh the slackinformation the history of slack and wejust basically uh took it to get thecontext and movie pie this is thelibrary that is allowing us to createthis amazing video with pythonsoum we managed to clone some voices rightwe had some fun uh we had the the one ofthe the main contributors and years ofthe community which is the Methodistwhich took his voice and cloned him on11 laps right which was quite funum and we also managed to put all themessages from from these public channelson slack and put them on VBS we wereable to find approximations to ourquestions and the topics we were askingarchitecture is quite simple right youyou make a question to retrieve from VBAthe semantic search uh then a number ofpossible answersuh then with shadivity we just give thecontext sort of DPT we give the contextand we ask hey can you please generate avideo script based on this a contextthat we founduh and we'll start generating theelements of the video right generate thetext-to-speech which uh with the audiofrom 11 laps we gathered some imagesgather some gifs and just measure itinto the uh like a hot Tamal uh withmovie pie rightand then we have our video so let's Imean the the demo is is quite astraightforward right as you see this iswhat happens when you have a bunch ofbackend developers and machine learningEngineers working together there is nofront endum so we created this uh basicallycommand Console Command right where wesend our prompt we send the tone of whatwe want to do to say Ricardo sorry tointerrupt you could you just like makethe screen a bit bigger like a commamaybe command plus few times yeah yesthank you perfect perfect and then afterafter doing that uh it will juststart doing oops wait give me just asecondbecause you need quotationsso what's the idea what is AI and thenyou want to have it funny funny yeahfunny tone nice if we start quitting bb8right for the data to get the contextafter putting vb8 it will create thescript with a DBT then it would based onthe script we're going to start gettinga relevant images and relevant uma gift uh for this to be successful forthis video to be engaginguh so here we can see I'll read thescript that it was generated rightum and and we we're going to startseeing in processing that and gettingthe each one of the elements now thisprocess might take a lot of time rightso I want to jump ahead and see afinished product right nowum we have this video here I don't knowif I have audio though let's tryand let me see let's listennow we can't hear maybe if you can putit on your speakeror something let me let meis it possible for me to reshare uh justa second because I saw the option toshare my screen audio but I think Ididn't check that box yeah let's do itleaving Living Dangerouslygive me just a secondumyeah the audio is pretty important rightbecause thenthen you can hear that the voice overthat goes over the script yeah the demoat the hackathon was amazing and it wasso good so I'm looking forward to uhhearing thishere the Metros again you know can neverhave too much of the matchesso you guys are listening now to myaudio apparently so let's let's see itnoit's not coming through it's not comingthroughwait keep playingyeah nothing I think you're just gettingit in your headsetthis is not so fun this is the thehardest part like this is the thingsthat I'm not missing about the more workI love reward but this is alwaysdifficulthey what we maybe can do is if we havelike one of the outputs we could publishit somewhere to YouTube and then we canshare it with with our audienceon their own time but maybe you couldjust scroll through like the videobecause at least the visual part isgenerated there you can also presentvideo files and like instead of sharingyour screen you can also share videofile like at least for me I have theoption to do a video file yeah let metry that that sounds like an interestingway to do it in just a second wellspotted Edwardsif all little spells maybe one of us cando a live narration just pretend it's AIbut nobody else has cool voicesI like to believe that I have a goodvoice thoughum I share it though uh maybe you see itis yesum welcome back to another excitingvideo on our Channel today we're divingdeep into the world of artificialintelligence buckle up because we'reabout to take you on a wild ridenow you might be wondering what exactlyis artificial intelligence well let mebreak it down for you in my own quirkyway artificial intelligence or AI forshort refers to the development ofsystems that have the ability to displayintelligent Behavior by analyzing theirenvironment and taking actions toachieve specific goals think of it asgiving machines a brain and teachingthem how to make decisions prettymind-blowing right but hold on before wego any further let me just say that Iwon't be throwing any external URLs yourway nope nope not today we're keeping itall fun and informative right here nowai is all about adding complexity tosimple tasks it takes something simplelike making a sandwich and turns it intoa mind-boggling process who needs aplain old peanut butter and jelly whenyou can have ai whip up a gourmet Feastfor you but let me tell you AI isn'tjust about sandwiches and gourmet mealsit's about applying ancient Chinesephilosophy too yup you heard me rightConfucianism taoism and Buddhism havejoined the AI party apparently thesephilosophies help explain why someChinese philosophers aren't as alarmedabout AI as their Western counterpartswho knew AI could be so Zen but waitthere's more we've got a littlesomething called The Phoenix project noit's not about mythical creatures risingfrom the ashes it's a business novelthat explores the application of devopsprinciples in an I.T context trust meit's a must read for anyone who caresabout the flow of work in theirorganization and no worries I won't besharing any external URLs but you canfind the book on a popular OnlineMarketplace now here's the thing AIisn't just about the tools and thetechnical side of things it's aboutintegrating people and breaking downthose silos just like in devops we needto focus on collaboration andcommunication so if you're an I.T personworking with AI don't forget to reachout and connect with the ml folks whoneed your infrastructure and tools it'sall about teamwork people but hold onwe've got a concern here folks there'ssomething called Shadow AI floatingaround research groups are skipping theit departments and going straight to theend product bodies this leads to smalland ineffective AI environments withinorganizations we need to bridge the gapand make sure that everyone is on thesame page I.T folks reach out to your AIcounterparts and let's work together toachieve greatness and there you have ita whirlwind tour through the world ofartificial intelligence we've coveredthe basics explored ancient philosophiesand peaked into the world of the Phoenixproject but before we wrap things up Iwant to take a moment to say thank youfor joining us today we hope you had asmuch fun as we did if you want to seemore entertaining and informative videoslike this don't forget to hit thatsubscribe button and click thenotification Bell we've got tons ofexciting content coming your way untilnext time stay curious stay awesome andkeep embracing the wondrous world ofartificial intelligence signing off yourquirky AI assistantthat's basically itI am so the Vivid air episode 10 will beAuto generated just play itnice yeah we have some good commentsthis is insane plus plus you knowclass plus always is a good commentnice thank you stay awesome stealing theline niceso yeah that's that's basically it rightwith the theme we have been also we wantto share this this is currently uh aGitHub repository open for everyone toparticipate or just to take advantagehere in Haines or four whatever we aregoing to continue working on it uh it'sit's a fun project it's a fun thing todo and it gives it goes a little bit Imean what I what I've seen right andjust what they tell what you guysshowcased today I'm amazed I'm sohumbled to to be here as well seeing allthis amazing stuffum and and we we see the opportunity tomake something fun right to makesomething a little bit different uh andwe want to for everyone to takeadvantage of it so yeah serve yourselfand have fun yeah nice thank you and wedid include the link to your project inthe video description so you candefinitely find it uh yeah this this wasepic I'm looking forward to seeing moreof this kind of projects as well nice uhso congratulations uh Nazarene HawkinsRicardo this was amazingum me hoping that this will be threefive minute demo was very ambitious butthat's always the case for mebut uh definitely worth there thereforeat the time that was uh great to seeumI just got a vehicle from my mom thatshe needs my banking information waitConnor lock your laptopyeah Mark Mark is impressive this isgreat great for effortsum yeah so thank you for efforts so nextup now that we're talking about demos uhEdward you when you join like you joinedVivid recently maybe even do like aquick intro who are you what uh what areyou doing here why are you at wig andwhat's your money you want to showokay no pressure before we we startabout talking about me I wanted to tryto show the video about the hackathonsince wesince we're about like since we talkedabout the hackathon yeah do you want toadd it to share uh like that like umthere you go let me play this[Music]foreign[Music]yeah nice what an epic video we shouldhave opened with it but I didn't know wecould share videos so easily earlier heylive and learn rightbut yeah that was really really nicehackathon and I'm very proud of you allfor the amazing demos you didand now it's about meI'm EdwardumI actually don't work I just go to coolevents I do cool demos and that's itand today I'd like to show you a cooldemo that we've been working onso we've been we've seen a lot of demosright now so I'll make it a bit quick soit's a sneak peekyes voila so everyone can see my screenso it's called Health search and it'sour cool open source demo it's notpublic yet but it will be soonand the big idea is thatyou can use this demo to find likesupplements for specific health effectsbased on the user reviews of theseproductsso you can like we have a cool searchbar here and a typical query orsomething that you would search would behelpful for joint painand we can press on generate and we getohthis is not working butif it works let me uh live demos notworking hey you gotta love a good livedemo rightdemo offline let me justwhat is going onso the back end is fast API soyeah are you readyto work now give me more yeah I'm sickuh whooprefreshso we get allsorts of products andthe cool thing here is that we get likeproducts where they have like userreviews specifically speaking aboutsomething positive about joint pain sowe can click on any product that we seehere and get a more detailed lookand we can see here like it only has tworeviews but it like it talks about jointpain and like a positive effect and wealso made sure that we like annotated orlike Mark specific uh keywords So likeum diseases symptoms to make it mucheasier to process what's going on so wecan actually go to something with morereviewsso this is about blood sugar sleepingbreath back pain back pain knees jointcare and joint painand so what we're doing here is semanticsearch and the really cool thing aboutthis type of search is that you getthat you don't do like this keywordmatching exactly so that you don'treally look for joint pain and likespecifically but you get results thatare likestill semanticallyrelated to this type of disease so youhave joint health you have joint careum andyeah this is a really cool use casebecause if you would use liketraditional search systems you wouldmiss out many different productsand yeah I like that there was like aknee pain example there right so it'slike yeah like we all know that kneesare joints right or orright all right try this yeah so this isthis is pretty coolum yeah and like the big idea behindthis is not to really give like we don'tbuild this demo to give Health advicebut rather really show the power ofsemantic searchandyeah so and before we actually like evenretrieve things there's something coolhappeningwe do like a natural languagetranslation to graphqlso we have a right now gpt4 model thatlike gets in the network language queryand then constructs a graphql query andthe cool thing about viviate is that youhave different endpoints you can use toactually talk to the database we havegraphql but you can you also have apythonic API you can use or also doeverything on typescriptbut for this demo we used graphqland the really exciting thing is nowum it can actually understandsorry my doors my door is runningrainingis it important I don't knowhey the beauty of live sessions huhSebastian talk about anything all rightI'll talk about something right now thisis this is super easy FDA at the doorisn't it yeah basically FDA at your doorright here arrested one you're goneum that's that's a cool like um I yousee this like the kind of project thatlike really show the valueum and like having a nice interface youknow flashing colors and everything thatalways helpsum but that's yeah definitely reallycool to see and um I know that that'sthe best thing that like I think uhEdward built it like within his firstweek at the other company so um it'sthat's I like this kind of this projectright like where you straight up heatedbeak on on week onewas it FDAno it was just a last packageso what are your medicinesmy medicine yeah there was mysupplements I bought that's nice that'sa quick uh quick delivery yeahthat's how the health search for youokayso you can actually like I choose nowproducts for sleep from the now foodbrandand it actually could understand whatI'm what I like what my goal is so itadded a filter that filters the brandbased like on now foods and now we onlygetum products from now food now Foods oryou can also say like best rated productfor energyand it understands your like what youwant and now sorts based on the ratingand this is really cool because you canlike really because in search it's soimportant to understand what the userwantsand this is a really cool likeexperimental demo how you can actuallyutilize it and then get the productsthat the user exactly wantsso this is the first thing that that ishappening then you do like then youretrieve all the things to semanticsearchand now we have something that is verycool which is called generative searchand maybe you've noticed it like there'ssome text coming hereand this is a generated product summaryso another cool thing that vv8 has arethe modules which you can use to enhanceyour search results and we're using thegenerate module here specificallyso what it does is it looks at the topfive uh results that you retrieve and itdoes a product summary on itand the nice thing is that it's likereferencing your query like the help ofa joint pain and it's a kind of questionanswering thing going on herebut this really makes every Searchuniqueso right now like based on the queryhere's the summary of products blah blahand then it's like names them and tellswhat is going on thereand we also do that for every productitself like we do a review summaryand this way you can really easily get agood sense of what the product is likeabout and what health effects it mighthaveso this is this product seems to beeffective in really enjoying pain blahblahor for example no significant healthbenefits or effects affects mentionedso like it makes information moredigestible and it's prettyalso if I I really like this use casefor like generative search because itmakes your life easierand as you've noticed like these resultsare coming pretty fast so of course I'mcaching them by the scenes but I'm notusing any cache I'm using viviate againas cacheand why is this good becausealso natural language queries can bevery similarso you yet like you can have differentwordings but you mean the same thingand we don't really want to wastecomputational power for queries thatlike that we already already cached butthey're like worded differentlyso for examplelet's say instead of helpful let's saygood for joint painand what happens behind the scenes isum yeah I can't can't show at youbecause I have this screen but it firstlooks uh if we have like a keywordmatchingum like if this query as it is isalready in Cache if not we're doing likesemantic search againso and we also also have like athreshold a distance threshold and if wefind a query that is semanticallysimilar to ours we would just retrieveor return the same results as we did forthe helpful one so we can see still likethe helpful thing in the concepts blahblah but if we typed in bad for jointpain I also cached that one but we getget a different set of results becausebad for joint pain is semanticallycompletely different than good for jointpainand I think also like using semanticsearch as a cache is super interestingand yeah so this demo will be opensourced once it's ready and everyone canlike we also host the demo publiclyand we also want to provide a opensource template so that people can justdrag and drop their own data set andjust have the same stuff going on maybenot all features included because thisdemo is loaded with a lot of featuresbut yeah just to like uh jump startprojects and it already has like reviewit integrated and you just have towhatever data set you have because thislike everything I just showed you youcan use it on any data set you can dotalk about wines or bicycles or Suitesor teddy bearsyeah the possibilities are endless andthat's everything thanks for listeninggreat demo and a super fast deliverythat was very impressive for sureum and there's even a suggestion youknow maybe we can generate a video foritlike come combine you know like uh throwlike a German law book at it you knowand then even better this ring can likegenerate some of the code for you so atthe moment we do graphql but maybe inthe serene's agent can help us generatethe python code or maybe other languagesso hey combine the forces between thefour of us four of you like they'll beamazing so uh excellent thank you forthe demo great startso we have two more quick ones to gooverum I don't see any more questions somaybe the next segment uhdone can you walk us through the VividForum leaderboardso that basically I have a way to sendpeople t-shirts or maybe some othercourseworkfor sure so our Forum has picked upspeed since the last time we talkedabout it or maybe there and we have alot of topics in the support categorywhich is the most popularand here you can see that I have a bitof a new design flare topics that don'thave an answer are colored in this uhpinkish color and there's this checkboxit doesn't check next to themwell solve topics have up check box whatthat means is that the topic has asolutionso if umour goal is to reduce the number ofunfold topicswe are still have some work to do therebut some things are just not soclear-cut and there's that one shortbut essentially what happens is everytime a topic has a solution the user Whoprovided a solutionin this case myself gets applied andthere is a leaderboard with these usersat forum.video.io leaderboardand that redirects to this users pagewith different typeframes so overallsince we launched the Forum GDP isnumber one congratsand then we have this shorter timeframeswith month and quarterand this is where Sebastian will step inand a word some prizes to Winners whoare outside of our teamso there's somebody this is like in thelead for it for sureum I'm not sure we're avoiding it rightnow right now or or maybe you know heyit's a good excuse to uh send somebody at-shirt alreadyum but yeah we should probably do it atthe end of every month uh check out uhwho's uh had the biggest contribution orif there's several people yeah let'sreward everybody that's a cool game toplayand uh JP if you want to get a free Vivit-shirt just resign and then continueanswering the questions for free and Iwill send you a t-shirt how's thatthat's so weird because I've sent youthat email already I've already quit soall right byereject it I am not accepting any of thatnice niceum perfect yeah this is super cool I Ididn't even know that uh this course hadthis feature for for the leaderboard butit's really cool to see you can also seewho reads a lot of the posts so that'spretty cool yeah all of this is publicif you go under usersand you can sort by all sorts of metricsherein the support category there is anotherway to sort by replies if you want toaddress topics and perhaps bring thatcheckbox and you can further filter bywhat's unsolved so take your PeakCommunity from here and help usreduce this thing topicsperfect nice cool this is this wasexcitingumjust a little bitum we hadsome very interesting Thanos today andwe'd love to see them in the Showcasesection whenever they are made publicI saw the running from localhost rightnow but if you want to share them in theShowcase section we can also link toyour presentation during this livestream which has been recordedoh yeah so Ricardo you already have yourproject on GitHub right so you couldtechnically create a post maybe evenembed a small video or something yeahthat'll be cool you see you came hereand learned something pretty cool howcool is thatnice thanks for sharing this Dan uh cooland uh last but not leastum oh there is a compliment for EdwarduhEdward this is great the mathematicianin me wants to ask what distance metricyeah I just answered this it's calledlike a default is cosinebut we have a lot of other things thatwe that are available at least but Ididn't change to change the metricmetric it's cosine cool cool I alsocurious how you highlighted thosematching words like knee pain as a matchfor drain plane that's a good questionsoum for my bachelor's thesis I wrote ahealthcare nmp pipeline that likeextracts diseases and symptoms but alsolikepositive effects like sleep or mood andI just reused it like I just ran all thereviews on it and then so that for everyreview I got like a list ofum like conditions or symptoms and I andalso like the position the characterposition and I used it to highlight themso I used my NLP pipeline to likeenhance the cool reviewsvery nice and uh yeah and also on thetopic of distance metrics I am going toshare it but we actually have a blogpost for ituh if you anyone is curious there's likethe distance metrics in Vector searchunfortunately I can't post links in thein the chat or YouTube just doesn'tallow us to share links in there but wecan always add it later in the videodescriptionperfectso uh leaving last or the best for lastor how we say it uh JP tell us aboutAcademy because you teased it up in thepast but we finally launched it so it'snow your moment to shine yeah thanksit's it's been a long gestating topicfor sure I'll keep it brief as wellum so we're launching this thing calledwe be at Academy some of you might haveseen it this is really really excitingand fun for meum and obviously like doing Vectorsearch and learning about it it's quitea lot of things you have to learn aboutyou have to learn about like deeplearning language models or NNalgorithms or and even just howdatabases work right and it's just a lotand I was like amazed at how much thehackathon folks had got done within adayum but if you want to sort of um youknow learn about abbreviate and allthese different topics that areperhaps less of a like a cauldron ofhigh pressureum this is kind of what we be at Academyis for so we designed it to be more of aholistic course from start to finishum as you'll see these are arranged intoum names so these are topics what we'recalling courses and each course willinclude multiple what we call units soit's like subjects you know in thecontext of like learning unitsum so you can go through that one by oneit's sequential so it includes likevideo content unfortunately you're gonnahave to see more of my my mug so you mayor may not get sick of me throughout thethroughout the course so there's contentwith videos and the videos introduce theum the the concepts as well as exercisesyou've got to go throughthrough the units and then courses soyeah that's that's kind of what it isand it's designed to design to beself-guided and self-paced which shouldbeum sort of you know suitable for anyonelearning at any pace and you can skipunits if you've seen a lot of thiscontent alreadyum so we've got the zero 10 BP courselaunched some of you have seen that inthe preview phase but it's now linkedfrom the main website so under thedeveloper tab you can click on Academyor you can click on the littleum I never know what this hat is calledum the academic hat basically so you canclick on that icon to get thereum I thought that was a ninja star youknow because you always throw it atpeople right or that's what I would Idon't personally you can't prove itum sonot meum and and there's also these likeStandalone units which are coming lateras well so we're gonna have Standaloneunits on how to select vectorizers andhow to deal with media that's not justtext and document chunking which youalready had questions about earliertoday I've been questioned to you knowHawkins um Amazing Project as well sothe idea is to guide we get users andkind of like make it easier to learnabout all these different Technologiesand Sciences behind the scenes which isreally really coolum so yeah please feel free to check itout I will definitely encourage you tocheck it out and give us feedback onwhat you like what you don't like andwhat you want to see because we've gotsome things in the pipeline that arebeing recorded and prepared but ofcourse we'll listen to your feedbackabout what you want to see more of or weyou know if you have feedback about thisstructure as wellum so yeah that's that's me I'm reallyexcited to see where this goes and tohave people on this journey togetherperfect thank you JP this is superexciting and uh great work yeah greatwork and um you know you can never havetoo much of JP's face right like so weare what you know I'm going on vacationliterally this is the last thing I'mgoing to do uh until I'm taking like twoand a half weeks off and you know what Imay watch a cheeky uh one or two of JPvideos you know just for the fun of itlike you know why not learn somethingabout Vector databases soum thank you all for watching uh thiswas an amazing episode with loads ofdemos thank you very much to our specialguest uh Nathan Hawken uh and Ricardo uhwelcome all to Edward Edward thanks JPand Dan this was amazing uh by the wayif you uh wanna you know find us like sowe shared even LinkedIn profiles forhonestly Nelson Ricardo and Oaklandlikes you can always uh find them uh inuh some of them may be looking for a jobyou never knowum so it's it's great to do that likelet us know how you like this episodedrop us some comments uh if you if anyof you have something cool to share andshow uh you I would like to open theinvitation uh just like Dan mentionedearlier you know like get yourself onthat leaderboard maybe you can help usout and one of those cool t-shirts ormaybe even a better one uh so yeah wealready see like some people excitedabout the episode The Yoga is going tobe be back that's great to hear andgreat team uh well great job team fromErica this is actually the first episodethat Erica didn't participate in so uhbut it's good that we we had her youknow at least you know somewhere in thespirit so that's good to uh to see sothese are my final words uh thank youall for your time and then see you nexttimebye",
