{"text": "Multi-tenancy: https://weaviate.io/blog/multi-tenancy-vector-search Berlin Hackathon cool video: ... \nforeign \n[Music] \nthis is going to be a record-breaking \nepisode we have Hall 8 beautiful people \nwith us here this is so much exciting \nyou can see Edward is super excited and \nthis is going to be super great and this \nis going to be the final single digit \nepisode this is a very important \ninformation because the next one will be \na double digital one \num so with us we have like a really \ngreat crew some new faces so you can see \nfor example hokun nesrin and Ricardo uh \nwho are our special guests who are \nparticipated in a really cool hackathon \nthat we organize in Berlin so they'll be \ndemoing some projects and you know the \nusual suspects you have done in JP who \ntalk to us about cool stuff and attend \nour CTO was like a cool announcement so \nthank you for spending your time and for \nwatching uh Vivid air like we're always \nexcited to see you and uh to have you \nyou know be part of this shop \num so thank you for watching and \nlistening and you know if you want to \nhelp us a little bit give us a like that \nalways helps because then the video will \npop up in more places and that always \nhelps it's always nice \num but most importantly because you are \nwith us live what you can do that you \ncan't do when you watch it later is you \ncould ask questions right so feel free \nto ask questions so as you ask questions \nI will be sharing them with our audience \nhere so whoever is talking about given \ntopic I can always ask these questions \nto them \num you know like keep it civil of course \nright like I'm not going to ask two bad \nquestions although like uh the same goes \nlike there are no bad questions just \nstupid answers \num so that's it and um yeah super \nexcited to have you here so what are we \ngoing to talk about today \nis first we open up with a multi-tenant \nupdate so uh next week Thursday we're \nactually planning the next release for \nvv8 that which was going to be within \n120 and the multi-tenancy is a huge \nfeature for us uh so at the end it will \ntalk about it \num I already mentioned the mlops \nhackathon that we did in Berlin so I \nwould like to talk a little bit about it \nbut more importantly I would like to \nshare you know we would like to share \nwith you the the winning three projects \nuh so that's why we have our special \nguests here \num then later on Edward \num our new arrival wait Edward I didn't \nintroduce you right damn I'm so terrible \nyes Edward welcome Wentworth he's a he's \na new rifle oh my God I'm so embarrassed \num maybe that's because you're a cat \nperson I'm a dog person you know like \nyou know that was on purpose uh but yeah \nEdward actually built a pretty cool demo \nand he really wants to share with us \num and uh it's actually really really \ninteresting way of using widget as well \nso uh we're happy to have you here uh \neven if I miss you to begin with \num then we want to talk to you about \nthis new thing we introduced which is \nlike the Vivid Forum leaderboard so for \nthose of you that are you know good \ncontributors uh you definitely can see \nyour name higher up and uh there's some \nrumors that I may be buying bottles of \nnice things to people that uh you know \nare tough contributors at the very least \nyou know like if you stay serious I'll \nsend you like one of those amazing wavy \nt-shirts or maybe some other swag \num JP would talk to us about the Vivid \nAcademy which is uh pretty cool and uh \nwho knows maybe you know if anyone likes \nmeerkats maybe somebody can help me name \nmy wooden meerkat because this is vasili \nhe already he has a name vasili or Vasco \num but the wooden guy doesn't have a \nname yet so maybe we have time out yet \nso uh also drop us in comments uh say hi \nlike say hi where you watch from or just \nask questions and I'm super pumped uh to \nhave you here and we already have the \nfirst comments uh from like some other \nUsual Suspects of Conor packed house of \ncourse go team go yeah thanks Erica \nso without any further Ado I'd like to \nbasically pass on the microphone to \natien uh and tell us what is this all \nmulti-tenancy about like why are we so \nexcited uh because like even like when \nwe talked about it at first I was like \nall right so what do we even mean by \nmulti tendency like why do we want that \nso at the end the floor is yours yeah so \nthanks for for having me especially in \nthis packed episode I'll try to keep it \nshort and and also hi to Connor and \nErica who just popped up like usually \nit's the other way around they they \nwould say hi to me on the episode so \nthat's nice \num yay okay hi \num so multi-tenancy \nand see one of those sort of very \nspecial moments in VBA history I think \nwe we had a couple feature-wise where \nwhere \num we would introduce something new that \nsomehow changes how you interact with \nvb8 or at least gives you the ability to \nto do new things with vv8 that you \ncouldn't do before and multi-tenancy is \nis one of them so first of all what what \ndo we mean by multi-tenancy like \nmulti-tenancy in general is the the idea \nof sharing some kind of resources for \nmultiple tenants so the name is \nbasically likely would have maybe an \napartment building and then multiple \npeople would rent an apartment in that \napartment building they would be tenants \nfrom the perspective of the of the \nbuilding owner and if you rent an \napartment you have some strict isolation \nrequirements you don't want to sort of \nshare your apartment with your neighbor \nunless you maybe invite them over or \nsomething but in general you you like \nthat you can lock your door and you have \nthis kind of isolation uh requirement \nnevertheless some things in there are \nshared so for example the heating system \nin the building might be shared and and \num this is kind of what this is about \nlike making sure that um individual \ntenants have their own sort of their own \nspace can do with their deal with their \nown things but at the same time they \nstill live in the same building and this \nis exactly the same kind of concept for \nVBA so for a multi-tenancy case you \nwould have a single vv8 cluster so it's \nnot single in a single instance but a \nsingle cluster sort of a single \ndeployment for example if you sign up to \nthe WCS that would be sort of your your \nbb8 instance and then you can host \nmultiple tenants on there and a tenant \ncould be so so for example if your app \nhas let's say you have an app for note \ntaking and um your your users basically \nwould be your attendance and it makes \nsense that that unless serve users \nactively share their documents if they \nsearch through their documents they want \nto share when it searches with their own \ndocuments or the documents off their own \norganization but not like if we as a \nbusiness the note taking app would have \nthree competing businesses like you \ndefinitely don't want those competitors \nto be able to search through each each \nother's documents so that's kind of the \nidea around multi-tenancy and this this \nconcept of course is nothing new like \nfor a SAS business it's completely \nnormal to have multiple different users \nand have these kind of isolation \nrequirements but the way that we could \ndo this in vb8 is completely new because \nbefore it's and now we can say that \nbecause now we have the proper solution \nbefore it was basically just work rounds \nyou could use this for example using \nclasses because a class already is an \nisolation unit in vb8 so you could just \nhave one class per tenant and this is \nthis is the the approach that we \nrecommended up until now works okay \ngives you the best sort of of \num yeah the best isolation requirements \nand everything but maybe two to five \nthousand tenants is the most that you \ncould run on a on a cluster and also \njust adding more notes to the cluster \ndidn't really help there because there \nwere sort of these Central constraints \nbecause in the end it was just the \nworkaround but now with the native \nmulti-tenancy feature uh we can actually \nsupport millions of tenants and every \nsingle one of those tenants could on \ntheir own have millions of objects so so \nbasically it's easy to go into the the \nbillion or trillion scale of objects and \nstill keep these kind of isolation \nrequirements and something that's \nextremely important and extremely cool \nabout this in in my opinion is the fact \nthat you're sort of never locked in like \nyou can dynamically grow your VBA \ncluster by simply adding notes or if \nyou're on the on the VBA cloud service \nthen you won't even know that then \nbasically our system in the background \nwill just add more notes you you won't \neven \num won't even notice so \num in our initial load test that we did \nI think we were able to to run 50 000 \ntenants on a single note in the exact \nnumber that varies depending on how how \num how much data you have per tenant um \nhow many fields how this is structured \net cetera there are basically a couple \nof hard limits that that on something \nthat a single machine can host which is \nsort of the whole idea of cloud and \ndistributed setups and sort of \nhorizontal scaling and um yeah with with \n50 000 so you could keep this on a \nsingle node as you grow your business \nand onboard more users and then at some \npoint if it's too much you just add a \nsingle a second node and then you have \nmore capacity for another 50 000 and so \non and this basically scales linearly \nand that's that's extremely important \nbecause that means sort of the whole vv8 \nmindset already like if you look at our \npricing model for example that is \nalready a pay as you grow kind of model \nand now we also have the architecture \nthat that works for that as well so \nbasically infinite scaling infinite \nlinear scaling with multi-tenancy \num from a user's perspective super easy \nto use it's basically just one New Field \nthat is added that's basically just the \nname of the tenant which you would \nprobably have had before in in one way \nor another anyway you would have maybe \nhad a field in your schema and then \nmaybe set a filter or you would have had \na part of your class name so super easy \nto use everything will stay the same the \nonly difference basically is that and \nmulti-tenancy is opt-in so if you don't \nhave multi-tenancy case you don't have \nto use it but if you do then you should \nspecify the tenant key and um yeah \nbasically use VBS as the the rest says \nthe same so it'll be super easy to to \nuse as well and \num yeah it will scale very well with the \nnumber of tenants it will also the the \nkind of isolation this is something \nwhere a technical requirement and a \nbusiness requirement or a functional \nrequirement uh come together so for \nexample something that we hear very very \noften especially in in Europe or in \nJapan that also came up more but it's \nalso more in in the US \num it's um so the Europe European in one \nis a gdpr but other kind of isolation \nrequirements as well where deletion \nplays a big role so for example \noff-boarding of of tenants and this is \nsomething that that you typically don't \nthink about in your business cases \nbecause you think about sort of \nonboarding new users and you don't want \nto think about losing them but one sort \nof technical case that we see very often \nis for example if you have a free trial \num if you have a free trial that would \nexpire let's say after two weeks or so \nnow if you have a marketing event or \nsomething else happen or your app goes \nviral on social media and you suddenly \nget a massive spike in signups that's \nawesome so that's that's one thing that \nmulti-tenancy can handle just add more \nnotes if you if you um if you can't sort \nof handle it with the existing \ninfrastructure but now out of those \nmaybe tens of thousands of users that \nall signed up on the same day that also \nmeans their trial will all end up the \nsame day and well we of course wish you \nthat every single one of your free users \nconverts into a paying user we know that \nthat's not the case so within like \ninsanely High conversion rate of 10 that \nwould still mean that 90 of users are \noff-boarded and this this sounds trivial \nthis sounds like okay then let's just \ndelete 90 but from a technical \nperspective it's extremely important to \nmake sure that those 90 of users \ndropping off don't have a negative \nimpact on your paying and and staying \nusers and this is something where if you \nif you don't have this kind of technical \nlevel isolation that can easily happen \nbecause in modern system deletes are \noften just done using flags and then \nsomething else happens in the background \nand you have these async processes to \nclean it up and that's actually very \nsimilar with Vector search as well so \nbeing sure that you can essentially say \nremoving a tenant is as simple as \ndeleting a file from disk and then it's \ngone that is super helpful from a \ntechnical perspective but also for these \nkind of compliance things like gdpr \nwhere you maybe have to prove that if a \nuser says I want all my personal data \ngone then you can prove that you can do \nthis in a certain time frame and that's \nthat's sort of \num yeah to wrap up where it started it \nis one of those big features where so \nmany things are coming together and we \ncan see this community demand so so \nshout out to \num to yurai who was here on the on the \ndeviate air uh maybe he's watching if so \nhi \num who's here a couple of episodes ago \num who had I think probably the first \nmulti-tenancy case that that we were \naware of \num it come it came up very often in our \ncommunity slack and now the forums \nthere's like Hey how do I separate my \nworkloads for multi-tenancy so it's a \nclear sort of Community Driven one it's \nof course also V8 as a business review \nit needs to make money so viviate also \nhas commercial users this is something \nthat there comes up more and more and it \ncombines or if it makes sense from a \ntechnical perspective and it allows for \nthese compliant things so this is \nbasically what I meant like something \nwhere everything comes together I'm \nsuper proud of the solution that our \nteam has built because it's something \nthat that scales very well that makes \nsense that is very sound and so it's \nvery future proof for multi-tenancy \nlet's say \nnice \num so just to wrap up as well like um \nwhat was like the main use case like is \nthis my idea of it was always like hey \nwhat if I build a business and then like \nI need to like have a separate \ncollection per customer or something is \nthat the idea why we need multi-tenancy \nor are there other use cases \nthat that is the the primary one like \nfrom the the technical infrastructure \nyou could use that for different things \nas well you could use it for example for \nsay in a Time series \num when you say like you have data uh \nthat lives for or you you add data every \nweek and you have a retention period of \n52 weeks you could basically treat that \nas a multi-tenancy case you could say \none week as a tenant you have 52 tenants \nand once you grow build it Beyond uh 52 \nyou just delete the oldest tenant so \nthat also allows for these kind of \nthings but that they're more sort of \nthat those are not the primary use case \nthe primary use cases are really as a \nbusiness you have multiple users and \nthose users can upload documents or \nwhatever they have to deviate and it \nneeds to be isolated to them like you \nneed to make sure that user a never sees \nthe documents of user B and also it \nneeds to make sure that for example if \nuser a has a lot of traffic and they're \nhosted on the same machine that user B \nstill has dedicated resources or still \nhas has um sort of we can still keep \ntheir throughput up so that you have \ndon't have this kind of interference \neven though they're on the same same \nsetup and of course also cost savings \nlike you could of course also say that \nfor multi-tenancy what I could just \ndeploy maybe one BBA cluster per tenant \nbut just think of million tenants then \nthen you're bound to have some kind of \noverhead and if you pull these things \nand still get the the isolation \nrequirements then or the isolation \ncapabilities then it's way easier to to \nsave on your infrastructure bill which \nyou don't have to care about if you use \nthe vb8 cloud service but of course you \ncan also self-host it and then then you \ndo \nnice nice \num you have two messages from the \ncommunity first of all gift uh it says \ngood to be here it's a gift to have you \nhere a gift \num intended sorry I couldn't help myself \nand uh Jurgen is saying yeah deleting \nspecific content is very helpful not \njust per tenant though good to hear \nabout this feature so very nice thank \nyou \num Also if anyone has any questions and \nnow is the time because I know Etienne \nis very busy and you have to disappear \nsoon so yeah any questions here \nif someone wants to uh find out more \nabout this feature is there a place they \ncould go to perhaps to get more \ninformation \nthere is we've released a blog post \num about a week ago and of course there \nwill be much more once the final release \nis out but for now basically the the \nteaser with a couple of more example use \ncases uh with with the kind of technical \nfeatures like what makes the feature \ngreat from a technical perspective \nthat's all in there so \num yeah I think Sebastian will put the \nlink in the description that sounds so \nYouTubey the link in the description \ncan I also ask for people to smash the \nlike button and subscribe please \nyeah of course we should do it um so the \nlink I'm sharing here on the screen but \nthere's also in the description of the \nvideo uh you can find all sort of links \nin there and this being one of them yeah \nso this was not a planted question not \nat all \nactually we didn't rehearse that so \nthat's fine \nperfect exactly perfect \nI see a couple of uh more uh responses \nso I see gift I appreciate my my joke \nthat's very nice thank you and uh Erica \nalready smashed it very nice with \ncapital letter so um I was like I should \nshout but I don't want to do that \nvery nice \num yeah this is awesome this is super \nexciting uh so my this understanding is \nthat this is going to be ready \nwith innovate from Thursday next week \nand in WCS do we know when this is going \nto allow London WCS \nsame same day same day perfect same day \nyes you'll be able to use it right away \nand um if you have an existing uh um \nsort of running machine on on the WCS \nyou can just upgrade it using the \nautomated upgrade feature if you start a \nnew one it will always start with the \nlatest version so you already have it \nand then you can add your multi-tenancy \nclasses by the way also in combination \nwith non-multi tenancy classes so that's \nand it also supports cross references so \nthere's there's lots of lots of sort of \nthings that we have to think about but \nthey they will all work \nand if not then let us know then it will \nmake them work \nnice this is this is exciting uh really \ncool and um also you can learn more \nabout it in the blog post that we shared \na link for but also if you're interested \nin the 120 release uh JP and Dan here \nthey're actually working on the release \nblog post so that's also going to go \nlive on Thursday so definitely check out \nour blogs page \num let me see if I can show a quick \nBanner for it so if you're new to vv8 \nthis is where all our blogs are come on \nshow it \nso uh definitely check it out on \nThursday next week but you should be \nchecking it every week anyway because we \nalways have cool awesome content \num perfect I don't see any more \nquestions for at the end uh at the end \nthanks for uh for joining us for the \nsession and uh for a great explanation \nawesome thanks for having me congrats on \non episode nine on the ninth birthday \nyeah the final single digit episode the \nfinal single digit episode I feel very \nhonored to be part of this this final \nsingle digit episode \nyeah thank you says hi \nI'm not kicking you out \nall right on that on that note the next \ntopic we have is the mlops hackathon \nthat we did last uh last week yeah that \nwas last week \num in Berlin well depending how you \nmeasure time so basically this is this \nis a pretty exciting things because the \nfirst of all there's this amazing \nCommunity called like the like the mlops \ncommunity uh and um I was talking to \nDemetrius who's like one of the founders \nof that Community uh and we're like hey \nhow about we do some you know events and \nhackathons together and he basically \nsaid that Berlin is a is an excellent \nplace to start because there's like some \namazing engineers in there there's a \nreally cool Vibe and who doesn't want to \ngo to Berlin anyway right \num so we kind of spend some time \npreparing it and long story short we \nended up with like um like a two-day \nsort of uh event where first day was \nkind of like hey let's meet and greet on \nFriday if everybody gets to know each \nother you know get some pizza and stuff \nwe're supposed to have barbecue uh but \nit was raining like hell so we ended up \nyou know getting some takeout like a \ndelivered Etc which is still cool like \neverybody you know had fun uh but then \non Saturday we had \nif I remember correctly about 60 people \nthat were divided in I think 19 or 20 \nteams uh hacking on various different \nprojects and then by the end of the day \nwe had 19 submissions all built with vv8 \num like open air cohere and a bunch of \nother things really cool ideas of those \n1916 were actually working demos which \nwas pretty awesome uh there was few \ndemos that didn't but you know that's \npart of the game uh and then eventually \nwe had like three winners uh three \nwinning teams so that's why we have here \nuh Nazarene Hawken and Ricardo and what \nI'd like to do is actually give them an \nopportunity to share their projects like \nso maybe a quick intro of who they are \nwhat they build and then maybe demo what \nthey did \nso we will start with nasrin uh Hey \nnasrin welcome \nhey thanks for having me \nof course so you have project in it \nright what can you tell us about it \nyeah so \num this project I did a coding assistant \nwhich creates code based on user prompt \nand based on user-divid libraries \nbecause \nI would data scientist and every diet \nevery day at my data science job I feel \nlike I'm confronted to the new library \nthat I need to \nuse \nso I thought about creating this Gooding \nagent which uh \ntakes a library from from a user and \nthen creates code based on that library \nand also \nthis is because current alarms like chat \ngbt and gpt4 and so on have been trained \non a pretty old Corpus and as we know \nlibraries appear almost on a monthly \nbasis and these LMS can't catch up so \nthe idea was to provide \nthese alarms with fresh documentation \nand to generate code code based on that \ncool cool so uh should we share your \nscreen and then you could run a quick \ndemo for us yes \nThat'll be amazing so here's your screen \nso walk us through uh through a demo \nokay so let's explore the user interface \nso basically what we have here in the \nmiddle is the uh the prom The Prompt so \nthe coding task that's going to be given \nby the user and uh here we have the \nlibraries that are going to be used to \ngenerate the code so in this project I \nhave provided the VBA library and the \nlanguage chain Library \nand especially because link chain is \nquite a new library and you cannot find \nany uh support on that with uh current \nllm models \nso you basically enter your coding \nprompt here and then click on generate \nand what's going to happen is that on \nthe left side you're going to see the uh \nthe plan for the code \nwhich is going to then be \ntransformed into code that you're going \nto see on the right \nand this code is going to be executed \nand the error logs are going to be shown \nin this console in the in the bottom so \nfor example here I have this coding \nprompt using the link chain Library I \nwrite code for an agent that gives \nweather information based on a \nuser-diven city \nand what I have here in the coding plan \nis in the first line I always have the \nuh the dependencies that I'm going to \nneed for the project and I'm going to \nlater talk why why this is necessary \nand then there's a generated plan for \nthis coding task so in the beginning \ndefining uh the the \nweather info function \nusing the link chain library to create \nthis agent \nusing the agent to generate the query \nfor the weather API and sending the uh \nrequest to the weather API and so on so \nit seems like a very reasonable workflow \nand we're going to see the \num \nthe result of the coding agent here so \nit's going to import some libraries and \nit has this this code which was \ngenerated based on the plan \nand how this actually works is shown \nhere \num so what happens is that the \num the documentation for the libraries \nare downloaded as HTML and these \ndocuments are parsed and chunked and \nembedded into uh in the Revelator \ndatabase \nand when the uh when we get a coding \nprompt from the user this prompt is also \nembedded and then we do a semantic \nsearch and we retrieve the most relevant \ndocuments from the vv8 vector database \nand we give this to the planning agent \nso basically in this project there are \nfour agents which uh each each one of \nthem is going to take care of a certain \ntasks so the planning agent is going to \ngenerate the code plan \nwhich is going to be given to a \ndependency agent and as we have seen in \nthe plan if the first line is always the \num the the libraries that need to be \ninstalled so the dependency agent is \ngoing to extract these libraries and \nthese are going to be then installed \ninto a virtual environment \nthen this code generate the coding plan \nfrom the planning agent together with \nthe context which is the relevant \ndocuments which we have retrieved \nare going to be given to a coding agent \nwhich is going to generate the code and \nthis code is going to be run into this \nvirtual environment where we have \nalready installed the dependencies \nand this code is usually going to \ncontain some mistakes so we will get \nthese errors and we'll give all of these \ninformation the context on the source \ncode and give all that to a code \ncorrecting agent which is going to keep \ntrack of all of these errors and with \neach iteration is going to \ncorrect the code and uh \nget the errors and so on and so a \ncertain limit that is defined by the \nuser of coding attempts is reached \nand we can see how this goes \nin action so I can give here a prompt \nlike if you want to use the vv8 library \nI write code \nthat I mean \nabout documents \nand \nuh queries and save them \nthank you very late \nby \nqueries \num \nbased on the user accounts \nor maybe let's see \nwe've all been waiting for the live demo \nthis is exciting yes uh so it it takes a \nlittle bit of time because it's going to \ngenerate a plan and then it's going to \ninstall the libraries and then it's \ngoing to run the code \nbut actually if if you're lucky enough \nwe can see how it is generating \ndifferent versions of the code and so \nwhat we have here is on the left the uh \nthe plan and we can see here it imported \nthe Vivid client with this Dash and the \nerror is that \nthis is an incorrect syntax \nso hopefully in the next iteration is \ngoing to correct that \num issue \nthis is epic he's actually trying to \nfigure things out step by step \num just to add some encouragement looks \nlike Conor is very excited like a huge \ncongratulations this is the best example \nI've seen so far of this idea \num and uh if if you don't know Connor \nConnor sees and knows everything that's \ngoing on in the ml space so if he \nbelieves this is the best example I \nthink this is this is a good uh message \nto hear \num \nthanks Amit uh we all think this is \npretty awesome as well \nyes so one of the \nnext steps for this so the problem is \nthat this is even though it's giving \ngiven documentation it's usually like \nhallucinates some of the module Imports \nand some of the function \num function parameters and so on \nso I'm currently \ncreating so I I want to create a good \nbase that is uh extracted a code-based \nknowledge graph that is extracted from \nthe library and that's going to be also \ngiven to the to the agent so that they \ncan verify if the module Imports and the \nfunctional parameters and so on are all \ncorrect based on the not only on the \ndocumentation but also on the uh on the \ncode base from the library \nnice this is cool and I have a question \nbecause we have like uh at Vivi we've \ncreated this repository of recipes \num like unfortunately Erica is not on \nthe call but we have this like there's a \nbunch of Jupiter notebooks is that \nsomething maybe that you could ingest as \nlike hey here's a loads of examples on \nhow to do stuff with vgate \nyes \nI think all of these sources of \ninformation \nare very valuable \nfor \nfor the yeah that's a that's a great \nidea and I've seen also \nsome research that also take information \nfrom stack Overflow and \nall examples so so for for the learning \num \nfor for learning from a learning \nperspective I think that's very viable \nnice yeah because I guess the idea is \nlike the more good examples we can \nprovide \num to the machine right to figure out \nthe code the better and uh we can \nalready see Erica excited about this \nidea right like uh and any place that we \ncould use recipes right Erica yeah \nso uh no that would be exciting I'll \ndefinitely I will definitely share with \nyou the links to the recipes if you want \nto have like another iteration it would \nbe kind of cool to figure out how to do \nit \nperfect yeah \nJP yeah you're here you could also say \nit \nso I didn't want to interrupt but but \nthose recipes are really really cool and \nI think uh people at the hackathon um \nreally appreciated having them to as a \nstarting point and building on them \nobviously as well \nthat's awesome \ncool cool I have one question from \nConnor so I'm gonna move you higher so \nthat you're visible I'm not that \nimportant so retrain from stack of \noverflow particularly for that code \ncorrect correcting agent party super \ninteresting curious how you are thinking \nabout the wibit schema design for this \num so \nnot sure if you're an expert when it \ncomes to the Vivid schema I would say \num and that could be still a tricky \ntopic I have started \ndoing the \ncode base now \nis a knowledge graph from a whole code \nbase where you can link the folder \nstructure and the modules and the \nclasses the functions and the parameters \nand so on \nand \num \nthen \nthen these should be checked uh or the \nagent should be able to query those to \nverify the the module in person all that \nkind of stuff but also how to uh how to \ninclude these examples from stack \nOverflow and everything what I've seen \nis that people use that information as \ndescription which they store for uh for \nthese different parameters and modules \nand stuff like that \nso that provides further information for \num for the other one \nI see that's interesting interesting \nyeah definitely a cool project to \nexplore deeper right and uh go go deeper \ninto it yeah cool this is uh this was a \npretty cool demo like I'm super excited \nto see it uh running live and like the \ncode plan was updating I saw that the \ncode itself got updated as it went and \nthis this is super cool like we could do \na whole episode probably on each of the \ndemos that we want to show today \num but yeah thanks for uh for this demo \num this is super cool thanks for having \nme it was such a great hackathon I must \nsay \nyeah well uh next next academ we do like \nwe'll definitely be using one of your \nlike your project and the other projects \nas examples of like what to Aspire to so \nyeah thanks for setting the bar pretty \nhigh \ncool so next up the bar is pretty high \nhokun uh you're the next one to talk to \nus about the project bgb for all \nyeah \nso let me want me to share the screen \nbut what's the project about what was \nthe idea \nwell yeah maybe it's better that I share \nscreen to to like introduce this idea \nyeah all right so \nyeah and hulkman I'm from Tio Berlin as \na research associate I work here and our \nteam basically incorporates three \nforeigners who are no Germans and one \nGerman \nso the problem we want to serve \nbasically is \nhow \nwe can use large Bank mode and also work \nthe vector database vva to solve \nproblems which might be encountered by \nforeigners in daily life \nand this one comes into our site bgb \nwell probably you have no idea about \nthis one it's basically the civil code \nfor German for Germany and \nit has \n336 pages \nand couple things about like uh the \ncontract issues from your sign contract \nhow should you end the contract or \nwhether your contracts illegal or not \nuh in order to understand this law you \nprobably need to read all the page which \nis 300 and \nmaybe you are lucky that you cannot \nstand and solve your problem \nbut it might be hard especially for \nforeigners we like me have \nno much knowledge about German \nand \nbecause of the larger language model \nlike child gbt is very uh powerful at \nonstanding \num this contacts however \num to actually retrieve this knowledge \nthis alloy is not that easy therefore we \nuse vv8 to help us ingest those uh \nthis law by basically chunk this book \ninto several uh small uh parts and then \nwhen we ask a question about specific \nthings like uh our rent contract then \num \nthe our assistant will retrieve the \ncorresponding chapter from the bgb and \nthen summarize with the source to the \nuser so they can without reading the \nbook and understand the law and how they \nshould react \nso too much talk let's see how it works \nhey how can you doing great by the way \nlike honestly to me even if you have a \nbook that is written in your native \nlanguage like uh already that is a \ndifficult hurdle to go and find the \ninformation like it's it's impossible \nand then yeah I agree like if it's a \nforeign language that that's even worse \nlike uh and me being polished living in \nDenmark right now I feel the pain you \nknow I know what you're talking about \nyeah thank you I can't I think many \npeople can relate especially my \ncolleague today when he see uh so I \nbasically tell about this uh podcast \ntoday and tell him the idea and he \nspecifically point out that I should \nemphasize that there are already 20 of \npeople in Germany are foreigners \nand probably most of them \ndon't have the native speaking ability \nof German so yeah I think that's a big \ndemand \nI think so yeah and and I also know that \nGerman is quite bureaucratic right so \nthere's like not many ways around it \nlike you really need to know this uh \nthese rules and everything and being \nable to find the information is just \ntough \nso uh let's let's see what we can do \nbecause I've seen the demo live and I \nremember I was super excited but uh yeah \nyeah let's see if it works this time \nokay \nmy apartment without noticing \ninteresting \nyeah for example I'm quite curious about \nthis question like which might be \nhaunted in our daily life \nand what is uh our assistant we do \nbasically is to retrieve the \ncorresponding paragraph from phb law \nthis book and then uh Supply that to gbt \nfor API and then summarize with the \ninformation from the apgp and then with \nalso the source \num \nso maybe we can just take a look inside \nto underhood we retrieve the law with \nthe the German translated but actually I \nthink a good feature from Vivid is that \nit has close language in bending which \nmakes it possible even here we just uh \nquery with other language we can also \nget the uh \nthe relevant information we want okay we \nnow gather with that let's see \nso this is impossible and we can get \nexact the paragraph in the bgb law \nwhy it's not about and I think this is \nbetter than maybe just try and search \nonline because yeah definitely people \nhave information about this but probably \nthey don't have exact paragraph to a \nsite to use \num to support \nand \nas I just mentioned maybe we can you \nknow sometimes people are no good at \nEnglish we can also try using other \nlanguage \nuh I'm from China by the way so I will \njust use Chinese to \nask uh if it's possible \nwell let me just paste it so here it \nmeans same thing as here \nthat I want to ask if it's love well \nokay cool \nsince it doesn't work this time but you \nknow we have a backup so I asked the \nsame question here \nand we also get the like the similar \nanswer uh \nand the theme \nis that it met with with uh English or \nChinese we can always get the answer we \nwant \nuh but probably for a user-friendly \nconcern we can also like change the \nlanguage here to to \num like user language and on the left \nside I haven't introduced Adam this is a \ncool feature uh developer and designed \nby Max one team member of us \nthat we uh specifically extract the \nquotes and also apply this translation \nhere and specifically this quote is \ncross verified from it to make sure this \nis no hallucination for uh GPT for \nmodels and we \nwe retrieve it directly from the vb8 \nand yeah you wouldn't you wouldn't want \nlike an advice from a hallucination \nright like hey can my land \nrecords like hey if he needs to make the \nmoney bye \nyeah exactly \nyeah that's that's why we want to also \nhave this whole features \nand in the future we would like yeah \nplease go ahead so so one thing that \nthat I remember during the demo you did \nlike you also wrote the question in \nItalian and you got any response in \nItalian is that something you can still \ndo \nuh well yeah definitely but not this \ntime okay cool \num I think uh I also tried to deliver \nthis feature as well \nbut like I think some prompts need to be \nlike optimized to have such stability \nyeah I think that's yeah that's also \nwhat you want to achieve to adapt the \nanswer to use the language that would be \nawesome \nnice and and I interrupted you when you \nsaid that you had like some ideas for \nthe future \nyeah exactly so in the future we would \nlike to open source our project and also \nprovide it for public use maybe also I \nthink it would be very useful that we \ninclude other big law other \num regulations or things into the \ndatabase review it so that like \nfollowing us in Germany they can really \nanswer their daily questions maybe also \nupdate their own like contracts to see \nuh if there are some like questions can \nbe answered also \nyeah that's like a cool idea if you open \nsourcing one day we could also work \ntogether on like a create like a \ntutorial or something it could be a cool \ncollaboration I would love that \nyeah \nyeah absolutely and uh to some \nencouragement so you can really like \nyour idea uh you know \nuh chatting with law content a dream \ncome true for many have your personal \nlawyer on your phone and ditch the real \none \nis laying dead on the bottom of the sea \na good start \nnice \num some of yeah Edward appreciate the \njoke \nso that's Mark so yeah \ncool cool there's a question for you so \nhow did you split the book would you use \nsentences this is really a good question \nI we actually in terms of issues when we \njust read the book uh at the beginning I \nthink we still just by the the new \nalliance mark and it didn't work well \nand at the end we just uh speed \naccording to the uh the characters the \nchunk size I don't I think it's still uh \num some experiments which can work hard \nto tune because uh it's uh splitting \ncould be quite an important thing for us \nto really retrieve the corresponding \nlike paragraphs so that the users lead \non camera and also uh one thing and \nadding upon upon that is that I think we \nat the moment don't have the page or \nsome \nmetadat adding to this apart from this \nparagraph and the later point I think \nit's also a good idea that we add such \nmeta information such that uh the users \ncould really wrestle and close uh verify \nthe source of the information \nnice nice yeah no this is this is cool \nthis is cool uh we should definitely uh \ncollaborate about on it in the future \num \nand uh like there's so many ideas in \nterms of like how you can speed the \ncontent in a better way and and it's \nalways like depends on the on the use \ncase right uh so we even have a pretty \ninteresting blog post on like ingesting \nPDFs and that also talks about like how \nyou split different parts of the PDF and \nto put it into another lamp like through \nan um so that's kind of cool \ncool yeah \num yeah \nI think maybe I do actually an important \nrole yeah because like all those books \nare basically \nwe need to be split into chunks so that \nlater on we can really retrieve relevant \ndocuments for users to check and answer \ntheir questions \nyeah agreed a great thank you for this \ndemo this was super awesome like um I \nreally like how it is like hey it's not \njust like hey he's a bit of data he's \nhow we search but also like the \napplication of it it immediately \nresonates for with anyone that had to \nleave abroad for a bit longer than you \nknow couple of months or holidays \num so yeah and then Mark agrees \nattribution of source is critical for \nlaw that's always important to be able \nto quote where something comes from \nperfect let's move to the final High \nCaptain demo uh Ricardo you're up next \nyou feeling ready \nyou're amused yes uh that's uh the \nnormal Mantra I still go to the office \nand I ask my colleagues in front of them \nif they can hear me \num so what's up people this is this is \nus right we I was joined by an amazing \nteam of colleagues from Colombia right \nthe the place where we're born where we \nlive our entire lives and then we moved \nto Berlin and we build this what we call \ncine scripture right \nthere is a tool that we we wanted to \ncreate to enable the people to get the \ncontent they need when they need it \nabout the things they care right so let \nme send you an example \nuh we have a collection of the slack \nmessages right from the Emirates \ncommunity \nbased on that slack there is a bunch of \nknowledge that people can easily access \nright but sometimes it's just hard to \nget to it right it's hard to get to a \nbottom of it it's really difficult many \nchannels many conversations many \ninteresting things to see so why don't \nwe just create a tool that enables us to \nsearch throughout a amount of content \ntechnical conversations uh interesting \ntopics and just get everything consumed \nin a single video that I can easily see \nand be entertained with it right so \nthat's the idea behind what we do \nso what are we using for this right \num we were basically taking a taking \nadvantage of 11 laps to generate voice \nright which is the the kind of the thing \nfor for boys generation text to speech \ngify because well we want to have fun on \nSplash we are to somebody right some \ndramatic viral in the video Open Eye of \ncourse to generate the content vbas \nwhere we store the uh the slack \ninformation the history of slack and we \njust basically uh took it to get the \ncontext and movie pie this is the \nlibrary that is allowing us to create \nthis amazing video with python \nso \num we managed to clone some voices right \nwe had some fun uh we had the the one of \nthe the main contributors and years of \nthe community which is the Methodist \nwhich took his voice and cloned him on \n11 laps right which was quite fun \num and we also managed to put all the \nmessages from from these public channels \non slack and put them on VBS we were \nable to find approximations to our \nquestions and the topics we were asking \narchitecture is quite simple right you \nyou make a question to retrieve from VBA \nthe semantic search uh then a number of \npossible answers \nuh then with shadivity we just give the \ncontext sort of DPT we give the context \nand we ask hey can you please generate a \nvideo script based on this a context \nthat we found \nuh and we'll start generating the \nelements of the video right generate the \ntext-to-speech which uh with the audio \nfrom 11 laps we gathered some images \ngather some gifs and just measure it \ninto the uh like a hot Tamal uh with \nmovie pie right \nand then we have our video so let's I \nmean the the demo is is quite a \nstraightforward right as you see this is \nwhat happens when you have a bunch of \nbackend developers and machine learning \nEngineers working together there is no \nfront end \num so we created this uh basically \ncommand Console Command right where we \nsend our prompt we send the tone of what \nwe want to do to say Ricardo sorry to \ninterrupt you could you just like make \nthe screen a bit bigger like a comma \nmaybe command plus few times yeah yes \nthank you perfect perfect and then after \nafter doing that uh it will just \nstart doing oops wait give me just a \nsecond \nbecause you need quotations \nso what's the idea what is AI and then \nyou want to have it funny funny yeah \nfunny tone nice if we start quitting bb8 \nright for the data to get the context \nafter putting vb8 it will create the \nscript with a DBT then it would based on \nthe script we're going to start getting \na relevant images and relevant um \na gift uh for this to be successful for \nthis video to be engaging \nuh so here we can see I'll read the \nscript that it was generated right \num and and we we're going to start \nseeing in processing that and getting \nthe each one of the elements now this \nprocess might take a lot of time right \nso I want to jump ahead and see a \nfinished product right now \num we have this video here I don't know \nif I have audio though let's try \nand let me see let's listen \nnow we can't hear maybe if you can put \nit on your speaker \nor something let me let me \nis it possible for me to reshare uh just \na second because I saw the option to \nshare my screen audio but I think I \ndidn't check that box yeah let's do it \nleaving Living Dangerously \ngive me just a second \num \nyeah the audio is pretty important right \nbecause then \nthen you can hear that the voice over \nthat goes over the script yeah the demo \nat the hackathon was amazing and it was \nso good so I'm looking forward to uh \nhearing this \nhere the Metros again you know can never \nhave too much of the matches \nso you guys are listening now to my \naudio apparently so let's let's see it \nno \nit's not coming through it's not coming \nthrough \nwait keep playing \nyeah nothing I think you're just getting \nit in your headset \nthis is not so fun this is the the \nhardest part like this is the things \nthat I'm not missing about the more work \nI love reward but this is always \ndifficult \nhey what we maybe can do is if we have \nlike one of the outputs we could publish \nit somewhere to YouTube and then we can \nshare it with with our audience \non their own time but maybe you could \njust scroll through like the video \nbecause at least the visual part is \ngenerated there you can also present \nvideo files and like instead of sharing \nyour screen you can also share video \nfile like at least for me I have the \noption to do a video file yeah let me \ntry that that sounds like an interesting \nway to do it in just a second well \nspotted Edwards \nif all little spells maybe one of us can \ndo a live narration just pretend it's AI \nbut nobody else has cool voices \nI like to believe that I have a good \nvoice though \num I share it though uh maybe you see it \nis yes \num welcome back to another exciting \nvideo on our Channel today we're diving \ndeep into the world of artificial \nintelligence buckle up because we're \nabout to take you on a wild ride \nnow you might be wondering what exactly \nis artificial intelligence well let me \nbreak it down for you in my own quirky \nway artificial intelligence or AI for \nshort refers to the development of \nsystems that have the ability to display \nintelligent Behavior by analyzing their \nenvironment and taking actions to \nachieve specific goals think of it as \ngiving machines a brain and teaching \nthem how to make decisions pretty \nmind-blowing right but hold on before we \ngo any further let me just say that I \nwon't be throwing any external URLs your \nway nope nope not today we're keeping it \nall fun and informative right here now \nai is all about adding complexity to \nsimple tasks it takes something simple \nlike making a sandwich and turns it into \na mind-boggling process who needs a \nplain old peanut butter and jelly when \nyou can have ai whip up a gourmet Feast \nfor you but let me tell you AI isn't \njust about sandwiches and gourmet meals \nit's about applying ancient Chinese \nphilosophy too yup you heard me right \nConfucianism taoism and Buddhism have \njoined the AI party apparently these \nphilosophies help explain why some \nChinese philosophers aren't as alarmed \nabout AI as their Western counterparts \nwho knew AI could be so Zen but wait \nthere's more we've got a little \nsomething called The Phoenix project no \nit's not about mythical creatures rising \nfrom the ashes it's a business novel \nthat explores the application of devops \nprinciples in an I.T context trust me \nit's a must read for anyone who cares \nabout the flow of work in their \norganization and no worries I won't be \nsharing any external URLs but you can \nfind the book on a popular Online \nMarketplace now here's the thing AI \nisn't just about the tools and the \ntechnical side of things it's about \nintegrating people and breaking down \nthose silos just like in devops we need \nto focus on collaboration and \ncommunication so if you're an I.T person \nworking with AI don't forget to reach \nout and connect with the ml folks who \nneed your infrastructure and tools it's \nall about teamwork people but hold on \nwe've got a concern here folks there's \nsomething called Shadow AI floating \naround research groups are skipping the \nit departments and going straight to the \nend product bodies this leads to small \nand ineffective AI environments within \norganizations we need to bridge the gap \nand make sure that everyone is on the \nsame page I.T folks reach out to your AI \ncounterparts and let's work together to \nachieve greatness and there you have it \na whirlwind tour through the world of \nartificial intelligence we've covered \nthe basics explored ancient philosophies \nand peaked into the world of the Phoenix \nproject but before we wrap things up I \nwant to take a moment to say thank you \nfor joining us today we hope you had as \nmuch fun as we did if you want to see \nmore entertaining and informative videos \nlike this don't forget to hit that \nsubscribe button and click the \nnotification Bell we've got tons of \nexciting content coming your way until \nnext time stay curious stay awesome and \nkeep embracing the wondrous world of \nartificial intelligence signing off your \nquirky AI assistant \nthat's basically it \nI am so the Vivid air episode 10 will be \nAuto generated just play it \nnice yeah we have some good comments \nthis is insane plus plus you know \nclass plus always is a good comment \nnice thank you stay awesome stealing the \nline nice \nso yeah that's that's basically it right \nwith the theme we have been also we want \nto share this this is currently uh a \nGitHub repository open for everyone to \nparticipate or just to take advantage \nhere in Haines or four whatever we are \ngoing to continue working on it uh it's \nit's a fun project it's a fun thing to \ndo and it gives it goes a little bit I \nmean what I what I've seen right and \njust what they tell what you guys \nshowcased today I'm amazed I'm so \nhumbled to to be here as well seeing all \nthis amazing stuff \num and and we we see the opportunity to \nmake something fun right to make \nsomething a little bit different uh and \nwe want to for everyone to take \nadvantage of it so yeah serve yourself \nand have fun yeah nice thank you and we \ndid include the link to your project in \nthe video description so you can \ndefinitely find it uh yeah this this was \nepic I'm looking forward to seeing more \nof this kind of projects as well nice uh \nso congratulations uh Nazarene Hawkins \nRicardo this was amazing \num me hoping that this will be three \nfive minute demo was very ambitious but \nthat's always the case for me \nbut uh definitely worth there therefore \nat the time that was uh great to see \num \nI just got a vehicle from my mom that \nshe needs my banking information wait \nConnor lock your laptop \nyeah Mark Mark is impressive this is \ngreat great for efforts \num yeah so thank you for efforts so next \nup now that we're talking about demos uh \nEdward you when you join like you joined \nVivid recently maybe even do like a \nquick intro who are you what uh what are \nyou doing here why are you at wig and \nwhat's your money you want to show \nokay no pressure before we we start \nabout talking about me I wanted to try \nto show the video about the hackathon \nsince we \nsince we're about like since we talked \nabout the hackathon yeah do you want to \nadd it to share uh like that like um \nthere you go let me play this \n[Music] \nforeign \n[Music] \nyeah nice what an epic video we should \nhave opened with it but I didn't know we \ncould share videos so easily earlier hey \nlive and learn right \nbut yeah that was really really nice \nhackathon and I'm very proud of you all \nfor the amazing demos you did \nand now it's about me \nI'm Edward \num \nI actually don't work I just go to cool \nevents I do cool demos and that's it \nand today I'd like to show you a cool \ndemo that we've been working on \nso we've been we've seen a lot of demos \nright now so I'll make it a bit quick so \nit's a sneak peek \nyes voila so everyone can see my screen \nso it's called Health search and it's \nour cool open source demo it's not \npublic yet but it will be soon \nand the big idea is that \nyou can use this demo to find like \nsupplements for specific health effects \nbased on the user reviews of these \nproducts \nso you can like we have a cool search \nbar here and a typical query or \nsomething that you would search would be \nhelpful for joint pain \nand we can press on generate and we get \noh \nthis is not working but \nif it works let me uh live demos not \nworking hey you gotta love a good live \ndemo right \ndemo offline let me just \nwhat is going on \nso the back end is fast API so \nyeah are you ready \nto work now give me more yeah I'm sick \nuh whoop \nrefresh \nso we get all \nsorts of products and \nthe cool thing here is that we get like \nproducts where they have like user \nreviews specifically speaking about \nsomething positive about joint pain so \nwe can click on any product that we see \nhere and get a more detailed look \nand we can see here like it only has two \nreviews but it like it talks about joint \npain and like a positive effect and we \nalso made sure that we like annotated or \nlike Mark specific uh keywords So like \num diseases symptoms to make it much \neasier to process what's going on so we \ncan actually go to something with more \nreviews \nso this is about blood sugar sleeping \nbreath back pain back pain knees joint \ncare and joint pain \nand so what we're doing here is semantic \nsearch and the really cool thing about \nthis type of search is that you get \nthat you don't do like this keyword \nmatching exactly so that you don't \nreally look for joint pain and like \nspecifically but you get results that \nare like \nstill semantically \nrelated to this type of disease so you \nhave joint health you have joint care \num and \nyeah this is a really cool use case \nbecause if you would use like \ntraditional search systems you would \nmiss out many different products \nand yeah I like that there was like a \nknee pain example there right so it's \nlike yeah like we all know that knees \nare joints right or or \nright all right try this yeah so this is \nthis is pretty cool \num yeah and like the big idea behind \nthis is not to really give like we don't \nbuild this demo to give Health advice \nbut rather really show the power of \nsemantic search \nand \nyeah so and before we actually like even \nretrieve things there's something cool \nhappening \nwe do like a natural language \ntranslation to graphql \nso we have a right now gpt4 model that \nlike gets in the network language query \nand then constructs a graphql query and \nthe cool thing about viviate is that you \nhave different endpoints you can use to \nactually talk to the database we have \ngraphql but you can you also have a \npythonic API you can use or also do \neverything on typescript \nbut for this demo we used graphql \nand the really exciting thing is now \num it can actually understand \nsorry my doors my door is running \nraining \nis it important I don't know \nhey the beauty of live sessions huh \nSebastian talk about anything all right \nI'll talk about something right now this \nis this is super easy FDA at the door \nisn't it yeah basically FDA at your door \nright here arrested one you're gone \num that's that's a cool like um I you \nsee this like the kind of project that \nlike really show the value \num and like having a nice interface you \nknow flashing colors and everything that \nalways helps \num but that's yeah definitely really \ncool to see and um I know that that's \nthe best thing that like I think uh \nEdward built it like within his first \nweek at the other company so um it's \nthat's I like this kind of this project \nright like where you straight up heated \nbeak on on week one \nwas it FDA \nno it was just a last package \nso what are your medicines \nmy medicine yeah there was my \nsupplements I bought that's nice that's \na quick uh quick delivery yeah \nthat's how the health search for you \nokay \nso you can actually like I choose now \nproducts for sleep from the now food \nbrand \nand it actually could understand what \nI'm what I like what my goal is so it \nadded a filter that filters the brand \nbased like on now foods and now we only \nget \num products from now food now Foods or \nyou can also say like best rated product \nfor energy \nand it understands your like what you \nwant and now sorts based on the rating \nand this is really cool because you can \nlike really because in search it's so \nimportant to understand what the user \nwants \nand this is a really cool like \nexperimental demo how you can actually \nutilize it and then get the products \nthat the user exactly wants \nso this is the first thing that that is \nhappening then you do like then you \nretrieve all the things to semantic \nsearch \nand now we have something that is very \ncool which is called generative search \nand maybe you've noticed it like there's \nsome text coming here \nand this is a generated product summary \nso another cool thing that vv8 has are \nthe modules which you can use to enhance \nyour search results and we're using the \ngenerate module here specifically \nso what it does is it looks at the top \nfive uh results that you retrieve and it \ndoes a product summary on it \nand the nice thing is that it's like \nreferencing your query like the help of \na joint pain and it's a kind of question \nanswering thing going on here \nbut this really makes every Search \nunique \nso right now like based on the query \nhere's the summary of products blah blah \nand then it's like names them and tells \nwhat is going on there \nand we also do that for every product \nitself like we do a review summary \nand this way you can really easily get a \ngood sense of what the product is like \nabout and what health effects it might \nhave \nso this is this product seems to be \neffective in really enjoying pain blah \nblah \nor for example no significant health \nbenefits or effects affects mentioned \nso like it makes information more \ndigestible and it's pretty \nalso if I I really like this use case \nfor like generative search because it \nmakes your life easier \nand as you've noticed like these results \nare coming pretty fast so of course I'm \ncaching them by the scenes but I'm not \nusing any cache I'm using viviate again \nas cache \nand why is this good because \nalso natural language queries can be \nvery similar \nso you yet like you can have different \nwordings but you mean the same thing \nand we don't really want to waste \ncomputational power for queries that \nlike that we already already cached but \nthey're like worded differently \nso for example \nlet's say instead of helpful let's say \ngood for joint pain \nand what happens behind the scenes is \num yeah I can't can't show at you \nbecause I have this screen but it first \nlooks uh if we have like a keyword \nmatching \num like if this query as it is is \nalready in Cache if not we're doing like \nsemantic search again \nso and we also also have like a \nthreshold a distance threshold and if we \nfind a query that is semantically \nsimilar to ours we would just retrieve \nor return the same results as we did for \nthe helpful one so we can see still like \nthe helpful thing in the concepts blah \nblah but if we typed in bad for joint \npain I also cached that one but we get \nget a different set of results because \nbad for joint pain is semantically \ncompletely different than good for joint \npain \nand I think also like using semantic \nsearch as a cache is super interesting \nand yeah so this demo will be open \nsourced once it's ready and everyone can \nlike we also host the demo publicly \nand we also want to provide a open \nsource template so that people can just \ndrag and drop their own data set and \njust have the same stuff going on maybe \nnot all features included because this \ndemo is loaded with a lot of features \nbut yeah just to like uh jump start \nprojects and it already has like review \nit integrated and you just have to \nwhatever data set you have because this \nlike everything I just showed you you \ncan use it on any data set you can do \ntalk about wines or bicycles or Suites \nor teddy bears \nyeah the possibilities are endless and \nthat's everything thanks for listening \ngreat demo and a super fast delivery \nthat was very impressive for sure \num and there's even a suggestion you \nknow maybe we can generate a video for \nit \nlike come combine you know like uh throw \nlike a German law book at it you know \nand then even better this ring can like \ngenerate some of the code for you so at \nthe moment we do graphql but maybe in \nthe serene's agent can help us generate \nthe python code or maybe other languages \nso hey combine the forces between the \nfour of us four of you like they'll be \namazing so uh excellent thank you for \nthe demo great start \nso we have two more quick ones to go \nover \num I don't see any more questions so \nmaybe the next segment uh \ndone can you walk us through the Vivid \nForum leaderboard \nso that basically I have a way to send \npeople t-shirts or maybe some other \ncoursework \nfor sure so our Forum has picked up \nspeed since the last time we talked \nabout it or maybe there and we have a \nlot of topics in the support category \nwhich is the most popular \nand here you can see that I have a bit \nof a new design flare topics that don't \nhave an answer are colored in this uh \npinkish color and there's this checkbox \nit doesn't check next to them \nwell solve topics have up check box what \nthat means is that the topic has a \nsolution \nso if um \nour goal is to reduce the number of \nunfold topics \nwe are still have some work to do there \nbut some things are just not so \nclear-cut and there's that one short \nbut essentially what happens is every \ntime a topic has a solution the user Who \nprovided a solution \nin this case myself gets applied and \nthere is a leaderboard with these users \nat forum.video.io leaderboard \nand that redirects to this users page \nwith different typeframes so overall \nsince we launched the Forum GDP is \nnumber one congrats \nand then we have this shorter time \nframes \nwith month and quarter \nand this is where Sebastian will step in \nand a word some prizes to Winners who \nare outside of our team \nso there's somebody this is like in the \nlead for it for sure \num I'm not sure we're avoiding it right \nnow right now or or maybe you know hey \nit's a good excuse to uh send somebody a \nt-shirt already \num but yeah we should probably do it at \nthe end of every month uh check out uh \nwho's uh had the biggest contribution or \nif there's several people yeah let's \nreward everybody that's a cool game to \nplay \nand uh JP if you want to get a free Vivi \nt-shirt just resign and then continue \nanswering the questions for free and I \nwill send you a t-shirt how's that \nthat's so weird because I've sent you \nthat email already I've already quit so \nall right bye \nreject it I am not accepting any of that \nnice nice \num perfect yeah this is super cool I I \ndidn't even know that uh this course had \nthis feature for for the leaderboard but \nit's really cool to see you can also see \nwho reads a lot of the posts so that's \npretty cool yeah all of this is public \nif you go under users \nand you can sort by all sorts of metrics \nhere \nin the support category there is another \nway to sort by replies if you want to \naddress topics and perhaps bring that \ncheckbox and you can further filter by \nwhat's unsolved so take your Peak \nCommunity from here and help us \nreduce this thing topics \nperfect nice cool this is this was \nexciting \num \njust a little bit \num we had \nsome very interesting Thanos today and \nwe'd love to see them in the Showcase \nsection whenever they are made public \nI saw the running from localhost right \nnow but if you want to share them in the \nShowcase section we can also link to \nyour presentation during this live \nstream which has been recorded \noh yeah so Ricardo you already have your \nproject on GitHub right so you could \ntechnically create a post maybe even \nembed a small video or something yeah \nthat'll be cool you see you came here \nand learned something pretty cool how \ncool is that \nnice thanks for sharing this Dan uh cool \nand uh last but not least \num oh there is a compliment for Edward \nuh \nEdward this is great the mathematician \nin me wants to ask what distance metric \nyeah I just answered this it's called \nlike a default is cosine \nbut we have a lot of other things that \nwe that are available at least but I \ndidn't change to change the metric \nmetric it's cosine cool cool I also \ncurious how you highlighted those \nmatching words like knee pain as a match \nfor drain plane that's a good question \nso \num for my bachelor's thesis I wrote a \nhealthcare nmp pipeline that like \nextracts diseases and symptoms but also \nlike \npositive effects like sleep or mood and \nI just reused it like I just ran all the \nreviews on it and then so that for every \nreview I got like a list of \num like conditions or symptoms and I and \nalso like the position the character \nposition and I used it to highlight them \nso I used my NLP pipeline to like \nenhance the cool reviews \nvery nice and uh yeah and also on the \ntopic of distance metrics I am going to \nshare it but we actually have a blog \npost for it \nuh if you anyone is curious there's like \nthe distance metrics in Vector search \nunfortunately I can't post links in the \nin the chat or YouTube just doesn't \nallow us to share links in there but we \ncan always add it later in the video \ndescription \nperfect \nso uh leaving last or the best for last \nor how we say it uh JP tell us about \nAcademy because you teased it up in the \npast but we finally launched it so it's \nnow your moment to shine yeah thanks \nit's it's been a long gestating topic \nfor sure I'll keep it brief as well \num so we're launching this thing called \nwe be at Academy some of you might have \nseen it this is really really exciting \nand fun for me \num and obviously like doing Vector \nsearch and learning about it it's quite \na lot of things you have to learn about \nyou have to learn about like deep \nlearning language models or NN \nalgorithms or and even just how \ndatabases work right and it's just a lot \nand I was like amazed at how much the \nhackathon folks had got done within a \nday \num but if you want to sort of um you \nknow learn about abbreviate and all \nthese different topics that are \nperhaps less of a like a cauldron of \nhigh pressure \num this is kind of what we be at Academy \nis for so we designed it to be more of a \nholistic course from start to finish \num as you'll see these are arranged into \num names so these are topics what we're \ncalling courses and each course will \ninclude multiple what we call units so \nit's like subjects you know in the \ncontext of like learning units \num so you can go through that one by one \nit's sequential so it includes like \nvideo content unfortunately you're gonna \nhave to see more of my my mug so you may \nor may not get sick of me throughout the \nthroughout the course so there's content \nwith videos and the videos introduce the \num the the concepts as well as exercises \nyou've got to go through \nthrough the units and then courses so \nyeah that's that's kind of what it is \nand it's designed to design to be \nself-guided and self-paced which should \nbe \num sort of you know suitable for anyone \nlearning at any pace and you can skip \nunits if you've seen a lot of this \ncontent already \num so we've got the zero 10 BP course \nlaunched some of you have seen that in \nthe preview phase but it's now linked \nfrom the main website so under the \ndeveloper tab you can click on Academy \nor you can click on the little \num I never know what this hat is called \num the academic hat basically so you can \nclick on that icon to get there \num I thought that was a ninja star you \nknow because you always throw it at \npeople right or that's what I would I \ndon't personally you can't prove it \num so \nnot me \num and and there's also these like \nStandalone units which are coming later \nas well so we're gonna have Standalone \nunits on how to select vectorizers and \nhow to deal with media that's not just \ntext and document chunking which you \nalready had questions about earlier \ntoday I've been questioned to you know \nHawkins um Amazing Project as well so \nthe idea is to guide we get users and \nkind of like make it easier to learn \nabout all these different Technologies \nand Sciences behind the scenes which is \nreally really cool \num so yeah please feel free to check it \nout I will definitely encourage you to \ncheck it out and give us feedback on \nwhat you like what you don't like and \nwhat you want to see because we've got \nsome things in the pipeline that are \nbeing recorded and prepared but of \ncourse we'll listen to your feedback \nabout what you want to see more of or we \nyou know if you have feedback about this \nstructure as well \num so yeah that's that's me I'm really \nexcited to see where this goes and to \nhave people on this journey together \nperfect thank you JP this is super \nexciting and uh great work yeah great \nwork and um you know you can never have \ntoo much of JP's face right like so we \nare what you know I'm going on vacation \nliterally this is the last thing I'm \ngoing to do uh until I'm taking like two \nand a half weeks off and you know what I \nmay watch a cheeky uh one or two of JP \nvideos you know just for the fun of it \nlike you know why not learn something \nabout Vector databases so \num thank you all for watching uh this \nwas an amazing episode with loads of \ndemos thank you very much to our special \nguest uh Nathan Hawken uh and Ricardo uh \nwelcome all to Edward Edward thanks JP \nand Dan this was amazing uh by the way \nif you uh wanna you know find us like so \nwe shared even LinkedIn profiles for \nhonestly Nelson Ricardo and Oakland \nlikes you can always uh find them uh in \nuh some of them may be looking for a job \nyou never know \num so it's it's great to do that like \nlet us know how you like this episode \ndrop us some comments uh if you if any \nof you have something cool to share and \nshow uh you I would like to open the \ninvitation uh just like Dan mentioned \nearlier you know like get yourself on \nthat leaderboard maybe you can help us \nout and one of those cool t-shirts or \nmaybe even a better one uh so yeah we \nalready see like some people excited \nabout the episode The Yoga is going to \nbe be back that's great to hear and \ngreat team uh well great job team from \nErica this is actually the first episode \nthat Erica didn't participate in so uh \nbut it's good that we we had her you \nknow at least you know somewhere in the \nspirit so that's good to uh to see so \nthese are my final words uh thank you \nall for your time and then see you next \ntime \nbye \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Air - Episode #9", "path": "", "link":
