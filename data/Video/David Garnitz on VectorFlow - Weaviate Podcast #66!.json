{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the 66th Weaviate Podcast with David Garnitz, the creator of VectorFlow! \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching the 67th weave podcast with \nDavid garnets the creator of vectorflow \nreally quick before diving into it I \nwanted to thank David for joining the \npodcast and please show some love to \nvectorflow on GitHub leave it a star if \nyou don't mind open sourcing is always \nawesome and there are so many exciting \nideas in the space of at the highest \nlevel how do we get data into Vector \ndatabases like we say you take you know \ntext for example text has all these \nthings like you know how are you going \nto chunk the text metadata extraction \nbeing an interesting topic then doing \nthe embedding model inference and then \nyou know with weave we've explored \nthings like the spark connectors or grpc \napis just you know like how do you get \nthe vectors then into the vector \ndatabase and so I had so much fun with \nthis conversation I hope that you know \nyou enjoy listening to the podcast and \nplease check out the open source GitHub \nrepository uh Linked In the description \nof this video D Garnet vectorflow hey \neveryone thank you so much for watching \nanother episode of the weevier podcast \nI'm super excited to welcome David \ngarnets the founder of Vector flow this \nis a super exciting new company that's \nlooking at innovating on how data gets \ninto Vector databases like we've yet the \nwhole importing data data ingestion so \nwe have so many exciting topics there's \nsuch an end-to-end stack with this \nfirstly David thank you so much for \njoining the podcast \nyeah thank you so much for having me \nexcited to be here so could we kick this \noff with uh you know what inspired you \nto create Vector flow and sort of how do \nyou see the problems in the space \nyeah so that's a good question so like \nto just rewind a little bit on my \nbackground like I was a machine learning \nresearcher in grad school and I worked \non some developer tools and \ninfrastructure at companies like SpaceX \nand affirm and ended up going to work \nfor a pretty early stage AI company \ncalled file read and at file read we \nactually had to build like a massively \nparallelized Vector embedding pipeline \nbecause of the volume of data we were \ningesting \num and so I saw that pain Point uh with \nthe team there and realized that there \nwasn't really any good solution in the \nmarket and decided to um go off and \nbuild it myself \nyeah amazing I remember like talking to \nyou earlier about like load testing and \nand that kind of thing and yeah it's \ndefinitely something we see at weave it \nis like you know people who put just a \ncrazy large amount of vectors into it \nand you know like whether it's you know \nbillions of vectors and this kind of \nthing can you maybe talk a little more \nabout um yeah just how you see the \nopportunity like with you know like \nusing Vector databases with billions of \nvectors I think there's kind of like two \nsides of this like you could be you know \nsomeone who's hacking on your personal \nnote-taking app and you probably don't \ndeal with you probably have like you \nknow 100 000 or so but or you're looking \nat these big Enterprise cases where you \nhave just enormous amounts of data \nyeah absolutely so I mean we we \npersonally think at Vector flow that um \nyou know these these systems these \nretrieval systems are going to be \nubiquitous right because every large \ncompany has an incredible volume of data \nthat they can leverage both for external \ncustomer facing products but also \ninternal products to save money and move \nfaster \num but obviously the space is is Young \nand a lot of the Technologies need to \nmature and so there's a big challenge \nthere in terms of ingesting data at \nscale putting it in the store but also \nunderstanding which data is relevant so \nlike internal there's a lot of old kind \nof stale data internally these large \norganizations too \nso you have not just a challenge around \ngetting that in but figuring out which \ndata to draw from \nyeah definitely I think um maybe if I \ncould yeah this kind of old stale data \nthere's I mean yeah there are so many \ncomponents to the data importing into \nVector databases kind of conversation I \nlike this like you know maybe the llm \nknows which class so like maybe this is \npeople who are watching this podcast \nprobably already know that wevia uses \nthe class abstraction to kind of like \nyou know isolate some type of data you'd \nhave like one vector index per class so \nI like this idea that llms maybe know \nlike which class to put data in like if \nyou're importing from multiple sources \nlike a common thing that people are \nbuilding is like chat with your \ndocumentation where you might be \nimporting from GitHub YouTube say slack \nand maybe you route these to different \nclasses as well so that kind of I see \nthat as one thing as well as the you \nknow the stale data kind of like um you \nknow refreshes handing document update \nhandling document updates as being \nanother kind of part of this but um so \nokay so with our podcast I think it'd be \nreally nice if we could just kind of \ncome to an agreement on this end-to-end \nand what data importing looks like so I \nthink there's kind of like connecting to \nsources is one thing like you know PDFs \nnotion readers Google Drive readers then \nthere's kind of like um I see this kind \nof cluster of things where there's like \ntext chunking strategies like there's a \nlot of kind of naive text Splitters like \nthe you know just rolling window \nchunking stuff like this there's also \nlike maybe using llms that a language \nmodel would look at a text Chunk and be \nprompted like please split this up where \nyou see semantic gaps and then it would \ndo the chunking that way there's also \nkind of like this metadata extraction so \nit's kind of like that layer and then I \nsee once you have the chunks you now \npass this to the model inference to turn \nit into a vector and there's certainly a \nlot of innovation there and then I guess \nfinally the last leg of the mod um the \nlast leg of the mile is I don't know if \nthat's the phrase but is then plugging \nin those vectors into Eva so is that \nkind of like a good uh storytelling of \nkind of like the end to end what it \ntakes to import data into Vector \ndatabases yeah I mean I think that's a \ngood high level story I think one thing \nthat we've also encountered in our \nresearch and discussions with people and \none of the things that we're looking at \num actively building into Vector flow is \nalso this idea of like pre-processing \nthe data before you turn it into vectors \nso not just metadata like metadata I \nthink is it's useful for different kinds \nof hybrid search right but there's \ntrade-offs associated with using \nmetadata like it can make the upload \nspeed slower or maybe you have to use \nlike a different retrieval algorithm so \nwhat we've heard some people do is to \nactually pre-process the data to put \nrelevant information into the chunks \num or even uploading it to the vector DB \nor before adding any metadata or \nanything like that so that's another \nstage that I think is kind of emerging \nit's pretty immature \num curious to see though or hear like on \nthe weviate side like what are what are \ny'all kind of encountering in terms of \nlike usage of metadata and \npre-processing and things like that yeah \nwell I I think this is such an \ninteresting topic that kind of take the \nmetadata out to put it into the chunks \nthat just kind of build on that a little \nbit more I see that as like um you know \nif you're parsing like a legal contract \nand it's like you know clause \ns3001 and then you would take that \nheader and you'd kind of put that into \nthe text Chunk like you know this is a \npart of this clause and then you hope \nthat that Vector embedding is going to \nbe better it's also probably going to be \nbetter for the bm25 scoring when you're \nthen saying I don't remember the number \nlike s3001 something like that like that \nkind of adding uh metadata into the \nchunk for kind of vector search but \nthere's a few other ways of looking at \nthis and I guess another idea like what \nI like a lot and what I think is kind of \nunderrated is let's say I'm parsing Out \nWikipedia pages of NBA basketball \nplayers right and I would and I come \nacross like age like you know Jimmy \nButler is 28 years old I don't know how \nold Jimmy \nso like I would take that out and put \nthat as metadata so then if I want to \nask a question like um \nyou know it could be the semantic search \nkind of question where I have like a \nvideo of someone playing basketball and \nI'm like who does this guy play like who \nis older than 32 just a random question \nor it could be like an SQL style query \nwhere I say what is the average age of \nplayers on the heat so it's like I see \nthis kind of metadata extraction thing \nas being quite important I had a bit of \na disagreement with nose rhymers on a \npodcast where he was thinking that \nuh you know all this metadata can be \nkind of captured in the embedding in \nthis kind of thinking and you know I so \nyeah so let me just pass it back to you \nto get kind of what you think of this \nkind of metadata extraction from text \nchunks \nyeah it's certainly an interesting \napproach I mean so I think the thing \nthat we're trying to understand is like \nwhere do you how do you differentiate \nbetween putting things like say at the \nend of the chunks right so you talked \nabout age like you could you could \nliterally just put the age of Say Jimmy \nButler at the end of every chunk about \nJimmy Butler right but then are you \nouting the chunk \num \nyou know I think the benefit right is \nthat like you can use a more standard \nkind of like a n algorithm to retrieve \nthe vectors and then you can maybe have \nyour re-ranking pipeline or whatever to \nkind of like get a high fidelity result \nwhereas like with the hybrid search you \nhave to potentially Implement something \nslower or you need to store the data in \na different type of graph or something \nright \num so there's different trade-offs um \nbut what we're hearing is that in either \nscenario these things are really \nimportant to improve uh the Fidelity the \nresults and that's kind of like the \nbroader theme I feel like that that \nwe're encountering I'm curious to hear \nif um you guys are hearing the same \nthing but for us it's it's a lot of like \nwe we like the the systems they're good \nlike they're easy to use but how do we \nget the results as good as possible and \nso that's where we've been trying to \nunderstand where in the industry are the \nbest practices solidifying because it's \nit's still such a nascent field \nI agree 100 with that I think evaluation \nis nascent like absolutely like um you \nknow evaluating how well your search is \nperforming I feel like is more of an \nacademic exercise and something you see \nI mean like I do think it's picking up \nthough especially like um just yesterday \nwe hosted a workshop with arise Ai and a \nrise AI they're building like you know \nlike a visualization observability tool \nand so you kind of inspect like you know \nthe vector spaces of the nearest \nneighbors to your prompts and sort of \nstarting to get some evaluation metrics \nlike I I that we could definitely dive \ninto this thing about evaluation it's \nthat's another one of these major rabbit \nholes but so okay so but staying coming \nback to the data ingestion kind of topic \num so yeah metadata and I think we can \ndefinitely come back to that if we want \nto but I I really want to talk more \nabout uh kind of like vectorization like \nonce you have the chunks and now you're \ntrying to like manage inference of like \na hundred million I don't know a random \namount of vectors but like of text \nchunks and you're trying to vectorize \nthem all and get them into you know or \njust get the vectors to deviates then do \nthe deviates half of the indexing part \nhow do you see that space of like how \ncan we vectorize this as quickly as \npossible \nyeah I mean I think that's where a lot \nof infrastructure comes in right where \nlike you really need to \num build out a massively parallelized \nPipeline and that's kind of where we \ncome into play where we enable pretty \nmassive scalability as well as \nconfigurability leading up to what \nactually gets vectorized \num or embedded \num but the \nyou you need to spin up like a message \nqueue or you need to stream some in from \nan S3 bucket and you need not just to be \nable to do the calculations in a way \nthat's that's quick and efficient but \nalso cost effective but you also need to \nmake sure that you're not dropping \nanything you know that you have a retry \nmechanism built in and I think that's \nwhere you get into some of these \nengineering challenges \num and this is where like you know my \nwork at SpaceX and affirm is kind of \nhelpful in understanding kind of how to \nbuild out this infrastructure \num and it's part of why we we took the \napproach that we took at Vector flow \nwhere we said well we're going to be \nmore of an infrastructure first product \nso if you look at if anyone goes to our \nopen source repo they'll see you know \nDocker images to spin up \num you know a message queue in a \ndatabase and making sure that you can \nget all the information you need to in \nthe database if you're in the vector \ndatabases I think one of the one of the \nchallenges that people don't realize is \nan issue until they start to operate at \nscale I'm actually curious \num what you guys are hearing in terms of \nlike something something that we we hear \npeople say a lot in discussions is um \nyeah we thought this would be super easy \nwhen we were playing around with it and \nthen we have a follow-up conversation \nwith someone two or four weeks later and \nthey're like oh we actually tried to \nturn it on to production we realized \nlike oh we we didn't think through a lot \nof things \nyeah well I guess for me it's like um \nusing the open AI or cohere embeddings \napis I think that tends to work for most \npeople like they they really enjoy just \nkind of sending their text to the apis \ngetting the vectors back and however \nlike batching is handled within openai \nor cohere is however that's handled but \nyeah I do think once you then are trying \nto like you know you've maybe fine-tuned \na sentence Transformers model or you \njust want to deploy one of the models \nfrom hugging faces sentence Transformers \njust to try to save costs now you open \nup a huge can of worms of potential \npotential like problems to solve like \nyou you now become interested in like \nyou know the whole inference \nacceleration camp with things like the \nOnyx run time or maybe all the stuff \nneural magic is doing with like sparsity \nquantization of Weights just so much \nstuff there and as well as kind of like \nthe the load balancing between uh you \nknow different vectorization endpoints \nyou might have as well as maybe um \noh maybe you're dealing with like Ray \nactors and you're using gpus for these \ninferences and so no you've added like \nanother layer of thinking about this so \nyeah maybe so so it sounds like to me \nlike you're maybe more interested in in \nthat kind of Latter half of you have \nsome kind of vectorization model let's \nyou know let's unpack the box and let's \ntry to optimize all these parts of it \nyeah absolutely and I think um so what \nwe've heard is that when you really want \nHigh Fidelity results you actually do \nneed to use open source models because \nthere's a lot more Innovation happening \num in that space for specifically for \nembeddings like I think for the large \nlanguage models themselves the the \nclosed Source actors are still probably \num in terms of usability probably the \nbest products but I know um from \ncustomer conversations I know from my \nwork experience at file read that those \nopen source embeddings models actually \ndo especially for certain use cases give \nyou really high fidelity and when you \nare talking about moving a system to \nproduction really getting kind of the \npromised productivity gains and and \nthings like that you want to do every \nsingle thing you can to make the results \nbetter which is you know why you're \ntweaking different steps along the the \npipeline right so we talked about \nmetadata extraction and chunking and \nthis is another piece where like you can \nyou can take your open source model you \ncan fine tune it to continue to improve \nthe results \num it's definitely challenging though to \nuse them in in certain ways like some of \nthem are really big right like um I \nthink it's like the extra instructor XL \nor something you need like 24 gigabytes \nof vram or like you know just just not \nthat many machines out there that can do \nthat \num that are cost effective so you run \ninto these different infrastructure \nbottlenecks \num but I think we're going to continue \nto see that become more of a norm \nyeah I'm really curious about \num I guess one question I have is like \nwe just released our like text-to-back \ngbt for all where it's using the ggml \nacceleration like there's like llama C \nplus plus I'm sure everyone's aware of \nrunning llms on C plus uh you know on \nlike CPUs with C plus and stuff and so \nI'm kind of curious like is like what is \nwhat is the state of that like can you \nreally run it on a CPU instead of a GPU \nI yeah that's kind of one thing I mean I \nI don't know if it would be worthwhile \ndiving too into it I think the topic \nthat you brought up that would be more \ninteresting to talk further about would \nbe that um that fine-tuning your open \nsource embedding model kind of thing \nokay I know uh Gina AI they're doing \nsome awesome work with their fine tuner \nand I'm just curious like what you're \nseeing on um you know how common is it \nto fine-tune an open source text \nvectorization or you know any any image \nvectorization any kind of model I don't \nthink it's that common yet like we've \ntalked to a handful of people that have \ndone it and the theme that we've heard \nis like the the complexity is actually \nmore than you would think because like \nfrom what I can tell fine-tuning an open \nAI model is not super hard because they \nhave kind of a nice interface for it \nthey have like your notebook out but I \nthink when you want to work with an open \nsource model it's more challenging in \ncertain ways \num I think also it's it's not totally \nclear yet what what levers to pull in \nthe space in terms of like what's \nactually going to make your results \nbetter so I think I read that with fine \ntuning you have to you need 10 instances \nof something in the data for it to \nactually kind of appear in the model \nweights and so if you if you don't \nreally have well curated data to \nfine-tune on then it's not going to have \nthat big of an impact whereas like you \nknow altering the chunks or the metadata \ncould potentially have like a way more \noutsized uh impact on your search \nresults \nI think another theme in general though \nthat is just evaluating right how do you \nactually even you know figure out what \nsearch results are good or bad for your \ndata and your system \num I think is a general challenge \nyeah well I think what's so exciting \nabout the well I I've talked about this \nall the time because I love this topic \nwhich is like the um you know you can \nuse the language model to generate \nsynthetic queries for your documents and \nthen use that as you know jointly your \nfind e you'd use it as your fine tuning \ndata for embeddings or you could train \nlike a ranking model where the ranking \nmodels are like classifiers to take and \nquery and document as candidate and it's \nslower but it's high higher Precision \nyou know or you could use that kind of \ndata set to evaluate different embedding \nmodels like you know now you have a \nsynthetic test set so you can say okay \nopen AI cohere sentence Transformers \ncompute for my favor and you could do \nthat kind of thing so yeah what do you \nthink about that kind of you know llms \nto generate synthetic queries to measure \nsearch performance I mean I think it's \ndefinitely an interesting idea I've also \nlike played around with this myself like \nI also like in more traditional machine \nlearning tasks have played around with \nusing llms to label data basically \ngenerate synthetic label data I think \nwhere you run into a little bit of a of \na question mark in my view is that like \nno two kind of production grade data \nsets have the exact same statistical \nqualities and so how do you know that \nsomething is good for your data set if \nyou're using an llm to generate \nsomething synthetic because also like \nllms I mean depending on the settings \nright they're they're inherently \nstochastic and so like you're not \nnecessarily always going to get the same \nresults in and out so you sort of feel \nlike to really start to get something \nthat's meaningful in terms of a test \nresult you also have to run things \nthrough an llm a lot I'm curious to hear \nwhat you think of this idea like one of \nthe things that we've talked about with \npeople is if you know your data well you \ncan actually rather than use the L1 to \ncome up with the questions you can come \nup with your own questions and have \nstuff as a yes or no answer you could \nuse the llm to grade it or you could \ngrade it yourself and then you have a \npipeline and you run stuff through the \npipeline a bunch of times to kind of \ncover that stochastic variability and so \nlike let's say you have 20 questions and \nit's like yes you know or they're right \nor wrong you can have a score out of you \nknow 20 or convert it to 100 right and \nthen you can do that like \n10 or however many times and you can \nkind of give an average and you have a \nvariance and all you do is you just you \njust toggle one variable for each test \nand then you can really isolate for my \ndata how effective is tweaking the top \nyou know K and top K results for example \nor swapping the embedding model or \nchanging the the filtering mechanism on \nthe map the metadata that's how we've \nkind of thought about it but I'm curious \nbecause you guys are you're so deep in \nthe space too like maybe you have a \ntotally different approach \nwell I agree completely I mean it's like \nthe the the large language models just \nkind of like erased the the favor like \nthe popularity of like extractive \nquestion answering models where it \nclassifies the answer in the retrieved \ncontext so there's like no chance of \nhallucination with that setup or you \nknow just having the search route you to \nfrequently asked questions and then it's \nlike you know the embedding similarity \nof the new question with the uh the \nembedding of the frequently Asked \nquestion and then you know Neva had \npublished this um awesome blog post \nabout like uh question to question \nembedding similarity is a lot easier \nthan a question to answer because I kind \nof like the style and yeah I think \nthere's a lot of interesting things too \nyou know that kind of component for sure \nand \nyeah it's it's like a I mean there \nthere's so much Innovation happening on \nuh like what the search box looks like \nlike um you know I think by the time we \npublish this podcast I I don't know if I \nshould say this because then I like have \nto have the podcast publish after this \nbut let me just not say it so like we're \nworking on there is a project in \ndevelopment at alleviate that's like uh \nyou know building those UI components \nfor the search box with the site sources \nand like you know the UI for it there's \nlike you know a lot of collaborations \nhappening with like versel and replit uh \nyou know I'm personally not involved \nwith this but I'm watching this of like \nyou know trying to make it easy for \npeople to like plug in front-end \ncomponents and there's so much like you \nknow whether you're using extractive QA \nor whether you're putting it to a large \nlanguage model like how you do the user \ninterface is definitely a big \nopportunity you know like how we're \ntalking about Vector flow and uh \ningesting data being a new market \ncategory developing these kind of like \nfront-end components like if you have \nlike a library of react components \nthat's also a pretty nice little you \nknow as everything is developing further \nyeah one of the things I was going to \nsay we're actually noticing the same \nthing too where it's like with Vector \nflow we're even trying to understand \nwhat is what is the entry point to the \nsystem for example like you know we \nstarted out with an API uh as the entry \npoint to the system because that's um \nit's technology agnostic right \nvectorflow is designed to be Cloud \nagnostic too but we're also seeing like \nif you want to rapidly test and you want \nto iterate like you know you probably do \njust want a UI to configure stuff and so \nI think that's in some ways a sign of \nthe maturing of the space where like it \nstarted out right with a lot of people \nthat are research scientists data \nscientists traditional software \nengineers and now it's as it matures and \nit enters the mainstream we have to \nstart moving to thinking more about \nusability and approachability for the \naverage person to kind of get the most \nout of these systems understandability \nso I think there's a lot of \nopportunities in that \num the vector flow is is really useful \nfor running rap testing Cycles I think \nthe whole industry collectively still \nhas a lot of work to do around \nunderstandability why do you have \nresults that you have \num and kind of you know having you know \nTracer I think they call it Tracer \nbullets right in software engineering \nways to understand what Pathway to the \nanswer did it take how can I repeat this \nand yeah things like that yeah no I \nagree 100 with that like the the ability \nof the zero shot models to evangelize \nbuilding with deep learning tools for \nlike software Engineers has just been \nthe probably one of the biggest themes \nin the story of wevia in my view is like \nbeing able to just take the open Ai \nembeddings and then you can build a \nsemantic Search application without \nneeding to have the slightest idea in \nthe world about how you would fine-tune \nan embeddings model which I think is \nquite a difficult task and so this is \nkind of like I'm doing like a long range \nreference back to uh the metadata \nextraction and kind of uh chunking with \nL I really want to kind of get for like \nthis kind of um you know importing data \ninto Vector databases I think the \ninteresting thing is I think there's \neven more opportunity for zero shot \nmodels to be plugged into this workflow \nand particularly I'm curious what you \nthink about the idea of like an llm \nthat's been trained zero so obviously \nlike gpt4 could probably do this task of \nwhere you give it that Wikipedia passage \nof Jimmy Butler and you say hey what \nkind of like symbolic metadata \nattributes are contained in this passage \nthat you might want to extract and would \ngo oh you know age 28 let me take that \none out or this kind of idea of um you \ngive it like some messy chunk of text \nand you say uh you know where where do \nyou think you should split this text as \nanother kind of thing that an llm could \ndo one kind of idea is that \nyou know they're gonna \nfine-tune or specialize llms that are \nmaybe only like 15 billion parameters \nlike 15 billion parameters I think the \ncurrent state of the art in text to SQL \nlike zero shot so fine-tuning LMS to \nplug them into kind of that part of the \ndata importing stack \nyeah so I think um \nlike to if you think about higher level \nlike what kind of chunks you want to \nhelp with the search result right so if \nthere's different types there are chunks \nthat have like relevant information in \nthem there are also chunks where like \nyou know is it keywords in the chunks is \nit the whole kind of simple idea of like \nthis is a sentence or this is a \nparagraph right and then there's \num things that are more complicated so \nfor example like I'm sure you've heard \npeople talk about summary chunking and \nhow like you want to do summarizing and \nit's like you get into some questions \nabout like what are you summarizing you \nsummarizing a paragraph a page a \ndocument do you need to be smart enough \nto understand \num like oh this is you know section two \nyou know \num part four and so you wanna like \nhowever many pages or paragraphs that is \nyou want to summarize that and I think \nthat's where llm especially ones with \ndecent sized context Windows could be \nreally good \num I think that the trick is like chat \ngbt you know especially gpt4 can be \nexpensive \num sometimes the API goes down things \nlike that so if you have like a model \nthat's specifically designed to do \nsummarizing zero zero summarizing then \nthat could be a really useful thing to \ninsert into the flow \num likewise with kind of extraction \nright like you could have a model that's \njust trained specifically for that \num \nand use that to sort of like extract \nkeywords or extract themes um I think \nfor us one of the things that we're \nexploring that is kind of interesting is \nlike \num can you actually approach the \nperformance of a deep learning model \nwith something more traditional that's \nway faster and way cheaper so for \nexample like could you use xgboost to \num do sentiment classification and just \nput those sentiments in the metadata \nand that would be like substantially \nfaster and cheaper maybe it's not the \nperformance is not quite as high as an \nllm but you you get other benefits from \nthat approach that allow you to make \nthat trade-off \nyeah I I see kind of two things like \nthis summary chunking and let's maybe \ncome back to that I want to I want to \nstay on this XG boost for sentiment \nclassification this is what Nils uh took \napart with my argument on metadata \nextraction that I think is extremely you \nknow I I think it's bulletproof is like \nyou know if you're letting the llm just \narbitrarily decide what metadata to \nextract from each chunk then how do you \nthen query it whereas alternatively if \nyou have some kind of classifier that \ntakes a you know let's say you've \ntrained just like I don't know if this \nis the best example but you've trained a \nclassifier that takes in uh Wikipedia \npassages of NBA players and then \nclassifies the age if it's mentioned or \nmaybe the team they're on I don't know \nsome like maybe like how many seasons \nthey've played if that's maybe something \nthat's kind of ambiguous that you would \nneed to kind of derive from the text \nsomething like that right because if you \ntrain a classifier on one special kind \nof metadata attribute it's just so much \neasier to then interface it at query \ntime because you know that like you know \nhey there these many this many ages age \nvalues or teams I don't know what the \nmaybe we should have started with a \nbetter example of like a metadata to \nground this like or sentiment why don't \nwe just come back to sentiment like so \nthen then you know at query time you're \ngiving it a movie review you want to \nfind the most similar positive movie \nreview right because you have this kind \nof label on it yeah \nyeah hopefully that kind of said the \ntransition nicely like what do you think \nabout that kind of or just to keep kind \nof giving our thoughts on like this kind \nof idea of having a specialized \nclassifier for the particular kind of \nmetadata you want to label each of your \nchunks with \nI mean I think I think that's just like \na kind of a broader trade-off that you \nhave to think about making with any use \nof a large language model versus a \nbespoke machine Learning System like a \nfile read we we looked at using \ndifferent Technologies to parse um PFS \num and ended up building our own \nclassifier because like we had very \nspecific needs \num in order to be able to understand the \ndocuments and I think it's all about \nunderstanding the data right and so like \nyou're at you're using metadata as kind \nof a way to understand the data and then \nadd additional reference information to \nmake the search better and so it some \npart of it comes down to the the \nengineering requirements and the the \nbusiness requirements around like cost \nlike do you have time to train a custom \nclassifier is it easier in terms of the \ndeveloper workflow to just use an llm or \nif there are these off-the-shelf ones \nlike do they easily fit into the \nworkflow I think I'm curious to hear \nyour point on this but one of the things \nthat we're observing in our discussions \nis people are using metadata in really \ndifferent ways like it's not yet super \nclear like what fields are common and \nwhat things you want to put into \nmetadata so like I think to answer your \nproduct question that approach sounds \nlike it would work better right because \nI think for any specific machine \nlearning task you probably could train a \nmodel that could beat an LOM at doing \nsomething very specific it just is a \nquestion of like \nis that specificity what is needed in \nthe market \nhmm \nyeah I guess it's like um if I'm if I'm \nimagining I'm building a chat box or a \nsearch engine for like we V8 questions I \nmight want to classify them into \nquestions about importing data questions \nabout the query apis questions about \nlike replication scalability like Cloud \nmanagement stuff so I might have these \nkind of categories that I would put on \nthe chunk but like what Nils was saying \nthat I kind of agree with is like \num if you have some label that you can \nclassify from the content alone you can \nprobably capture it in the embedding as \nwell like the embedding model could \ncapture that kind of thing in its \nrepresentation \nand that that's kind of what I see yeah \nI I guess for me the the reason I like \nthis whole argument is because I like \nthinking about these systems as like \nlike I like to try to point people to \nthe weeviates aggregate API like we V8 \nit's a vector database but you also can \ndo symbolic queries in weba like if you \nwant to say what's the average age of \nNBA players you you can ask that kind of \nquestion to alleviate so that's kind of \nwhat I see is the clear value of the \nmetadata you know for for kind of query \nparsing and adding filters to queries \nI'm not sure I understand it all the way \nI understand definitely like as one of \nour earlier conversation topics like a \npart I imagine with the end-to-end \nimporting data to wevia is like you \nimport it from multiple sources like you \nhave tweets you have GitHub you have \nYouTube you have uh slack and so you \nmight want to put those into like you \nmight want to have a symbolic filter \nthat uh you know separates that at query \ntime \nyeah I mean I think \nthe space is so young right that I think \none of the things we're going to see \nemerge is sort of \nmore standardized access patterns let's \ncall them right and I think that's one \nof the kind of Visions for what we're \ntrying to achieve with Vector flow is to \nbe part of this process of like \nbuilding almost building like an HTTP \nfor for kind of querying your your uh \nsemantic your contextual data right so \nlike not HTTP itself but this idea of a \nprotocol standardized fields and things \nthat you're going to access so as the \nspace matures we might understand like \nthese are the types of metadata that are \nreally important and that most people \nuse and then it does make sense to have \noff-the-shelf classifiers uh to do those \nthings \nto extract those things \nyeah because I well yeah \nyeah well let me get your temperature on \nthat argument of if you can classify it \nin the content the embedding can also \ncapture it \nyeah I mean that makes sense high level \nI guess like for me it's like the \nvectors are so entangled like of you \nknow like you know Vector representation \nof an object like from open AI the 1536 \nDimensions there's you can't like point \nat two indexes of that vector and say \nthis is how much of a cat it is right \nlike it's it's completely entangled \nacross the entire Vector so that's \nthat's why I still see like if you \nclassify like give a picture of a dog \nand like yeah the embedding captures \nthat it's a dog but if you have a \nclassifier that uh does the like it \nmight be a dog jumping to catch a \nfrisbee or it's like in a pool or \nsomething and so it's kind of like \nentangled with like dog but also like \ndog swimming kind of like so so I see if \nyou have some kind of attribute that you \nknow is going to be super important like \nwhat kind of particular dog it is to \nclassify that and have that in addition \nto the embedding I could see that as \nbeing some kind of lever that could \nimprove your search relevance yeah \nabsolutely I think we're agreed on that \nI think one of the things that I'm \ncurious about maybe because we're so \nVector flow is more on the ingestion \nside right and I'm I think at a certain \npoint once you have the information in \nthe vector database you need to be \nclever about how you retrieve it right \nso I think that's for like also certain \nthings like re-ranking can come into \nplay where like okay you have all these \nthese different concepts of a dog in the \nvector embedding but it's like how do \nyou actually turn that into like the \nright kind of \noverall view of the information to \nextract \num yeah yeah \nno I think that's so it kind of comes \nlike into you you mentioned writing \ncustom code to parse PDFs and like you \nknow unstructured is a really exciting \ncompany that's doing like um one I mean \nI think there's a lot of cool parts to \ninstructure but one thing that Brian \nexplained to me on the podcast was about \nuh doing like a visual document layout \nand so you know you visually put the \ndocument and you would say like and it \nsay like this is an image caption and so \nbecause then yeah and then everything \nyou do at importing time then is going \nto impact what you can do at query time \nbecause then if you want to have some \nyou know it could be a filtered search \nwhere you only want to search through \nimage captions or you want to have like \na ranking kind of uh like a ranking \nequation where you say like boost the \nresults if it's a image caption I don't \nknow image caption is the best example \nbut like that kind of thing \nyeah absolutely I mean unstructured is a \nreally uh really cool tool we're playing \naround with adding it to uh to \nvectorflow to help with certain things \nfor example like how would you ask \nquestions about like a pitch deck or a \ncardboard slide and because maybe like \nyou know that's portrayed as it's \nuploaded as a PF which our system \naccepts PDFs \num but a lot of the information embedded \nin that might be visual or spatial I \nthink an interesting idea is like take \nthe idea of an infographic right how and \nlet's say you have a textual system that \nwill be very if you have an infographic \nin a PDF or a word doc or something how \ndo you convert that into something that \nyou can represent textually in the \nvector database for example and you know \nare you storing multiple modals in the \nsame index or are you is there a way to \ndo that transformation I think this idea \nof having tags about images as well \num could be could be another interesting \nway around that but um congestion \nproblem in general like there's so many \ndifferent combinations of things that \nit's really exciting to think about how \nhow you can best represent those in a \nvectorized form and make the the \nretrieval results ultimately better \nyeah I'm I'm so excited about this \nconversation topic infographic brilliant \nexample I haven't heard that before and \nquick shout out to instructed with the \nuh shout out I hate that word I hate \nthat I just said that but like a good \nguy like to unstructured who just did \nthe like um processing tables visually \nAnd Turning Tables into uh searchable \nthings that it's really inspiring work \nand so I'm I I want to kind of talk \nabout I had this idea as you were \ntalking like um you know with our whole \nconversation of metadata extraction \nmaybe it makes sense to create a new \nclass and weviate that only has like 50 \nobjects in it but they're really like \nsymbolically annotated and that's where \nyou would store the kind of information \nneeded for these symbolic SQL style \nqueries like you know if you have \ncountry music singers and like the \ningestion engine is parsing through an \nentire Wikipedia page maybe it just \nmakes like one data object to put in \nthis other class which is like symbolic \ncountry music singers I don't know and \nthen all that but then all the chunks go \nto this other class which is like the \nsector class and so you so you separate \nit into two kind of classes in sort of \nlike a weevia native way of thinking I'm \nsure all the vector databases do like \nsome kind of abstraction between classes \nsome something that sounds like that \nyeah absolutely I mean um I think how \nthe different information \nwill ultimately get tied together is \nstill an open question that's why I was \ntalking about like what is going to be \nthe solidified data access pattern \num \nyou know perhaps like it makes sense to \nto have certain information in the \nvector database and because the vector \ndatabase right it's not the result that \nyou get from the vector database you're \ngetting things that match your your \ninput query right but perhaps like in \nyour re-ranking pipeline or something \nyou then go and you hit your SQL \ndatabase to do certain kinds of searches \nthat they're more optimized for \num I think I I think these kinds of \nquestions will the patterns and the best \npractices will become solidified over \ntime but I think it's an interesting \nidea to see like what else could you put \ninto a vector database you know and I'm \ncurious for example like I brought up \nthis idea of multimodal like how how \nwell those things will play together you \nknow like in infographic in in a PDF for \nexample that has a lot of text \num it's not something that uh Canada \nwe've we've played around with yet but \nit's certainly I think an exciting New \nFrontier because if you think about like \nmost data in like a corporate \nenvironment it's probably going to be \nmixed \nyeah no it like it it like I feel like \nthe like with the world of vector \ndatabases I feel like there's kind of \nthe power in the hnsw implementation and \nthen all the database kind of stuff \naround making that like crud compatible \nand scalable and all that kind of stuff \nand then I see like these two layers \nwith like the importing data into it and \nthen kind of like the query engine the \nquery interface and then of course \nthere's like the language model which is \nanother like major like PowerPoint I'd \nsay because of how of like the mode of \ntrying to create another one but like \nthat kind of um the query engine part is \nquite interesting because you know \nthere's like the llm Frameworks Market \nwith like llama index Lang chain uh \nHaystack Gina and and others um maybe \nforget off the top of my head but like \nthat they they would do like this kind \nof um you know like one thing like one \nof my favorite abstractions in llama \nindex is the query router where the llm \ntakes the query and it says is this a \nsemantic search query or is this an SQL \nquery or maybe it's like a Knowledge \nGraph query too that's where I think \nthese when Frameworks will like always \nkind of sit in an interesting place \nbecause they can like combine SQL with \nVector search with like these Knowledge \nGraph or like graph database \nTechnologies and I think that's a really \ninteresting kind of component to it but \nI do think it's likely that um \nyou know and I'm like it's like maybe I \nshould like get to working on this right \nafter we hang up the call but like I \nthink it's quite likely that we can \nbuild some kind of interesting uh query \nrouter into leviate for this is it's \nlike a little interesting like how the \ndesign will work but we via has this \nmodule system where like you know we \ninterface our near text to do Vector \nsearch or hybrid search our hybrid you \nknow query API as well as re-ranking and \nso I think we can keep going up like do \nwe want to go so far up to have like \nChain of Thought and like Auto gbt style \nquery engines directly into weeviate I'm \nreally not sure but I do think that kind \nof query router thing \nit's gonna be a pretty important part of \nit I think I think I think you actually \nmight talk about this the first time we \nhad a discussion I may have also talked \nabout it with the the head of research \nfrom weeviate that like \num this idea of query optimization right \nit's like that's a that's a big thing in \ntraditional databases \num where you have you know entire \nin modules built into the system that \ncan kind of translate things to optimize \ndepending on what you want whether it's \nlike a smart way to index or you're \noptimizing for Speed or whatever and in \nin terms of the performance of the query \nlike as measured by the Fidelity the \nresult right I think that's actually a \nreally interesting Frontier for Vector \ndatabases and you know can you put um a \nquery uh sort of Optimizer in front of \nit and like you know you were describing \nas a router but what I almost imagine is \nsomething that can kind of reword things \nand whether that's like you know a \nmachine learning model like a large \nlanguage model of some kind that \nspecialized to that task or \num whether it's it's the exact approach \nI think is unknown but this idea of like \nonce you once you have enough data about \nhow different queries perform you could \nactually start to alter the wording \num to make to make them better I think \nis actually a really exciting Frontier \nit's it's outside of the box of what \nwe're what we're doing at Vector flow \nbut it's definitely something we've \nheard people ask for pretty consistently \nin the discussions it's like yeah we're \nnot exactly sure the best way to hit the \nvector database to get the best results \num and it would be cool if you guys \nbuilt that because you probably have all \nthe internal data to know like what \nactually does constitute like a good \nquery versus a bad query for the same \nfor the same index \nwell this is so much cool stuff in what \nyou just said I think start yeah like \nkind of yeah like the query formulation \nthing maybe just come on that and then \nand then hit it with the big payload \nthing guys change the conversation topic \nwith this but like yeah that kind of \nidea you take like people are sending \nprompts and so you don't want to just \nsend the prompt as the search query most \nof the time you'd want to like you know \nextract like what is a search query \nparticularly send that to the vector \ndatabase and then that's kind of how it \nall gets combined with the prompt and \nthe new search results but here so \nhere's kind of the thing that I think is \nlike really exciting uh so I'm still in \nthis term from Andy Pavlo who's a \nprofessor database is at Carnegie Mellon \nwhich is uh self-driving databases so \nit's about databases that kind of like \noptimize themselves the indexes they \nbuild based on the queries that they're \nseeing in coming in so like you know if \nyou're like uh uh like a payroll \ndatabase and you're seeing this \nparticular kind of you know let's say \nyou have like 30 tables you get like \nthis crazy complicated payroll and so \nyou're seeing this particular kind of \njoining pattern being queried a lot you \nwould start to like build up an index \nfor that join and so yeah I'm really \ncurious like this also comes into this \nother topic at we get that we like a lot \ncalled um generative feedback loops or \ngenerative feedback loops are like you \ntake some of your data you put it into \nan llm and then you save the resulting \ngeneration \nso so kind of marrying these ideas \nis like you're seeing particular kinds \nof queries coming in and then your llm \ncould kind of like transform your data \nin your database to better accommodate \nthese queries and I might I might be \ndiving in too much let me like get your \ntemperature on the idea at a high level \nand then we'll kind of go further into \nhow this might work I mean I think it's \nan interesting idea as long as you \nbasically accept the premise that a \nvector database doesn't provide the same \nset of guarantees that a normal database \ndoes right like you know with SQL \ndatabase you have like the acid \nprinciples like \num you know you want to make sure that \nthe data is always like the transactions \nguarantee the Integrity of the data and \ncertain things like that I think if \nyou're treating the vector database as a \nstore to to Really provide \nsome kind of system capabilities like \naround end user performance rather than \nlike we need this data for this system \nto kind of have its core operation like \nlike to store it \num to back up what's happened and to be \na member but rather like this enables \nlike the core flow I mean you accept \nthat those are different premises I \ndon't know if I'm describing it \num the most adequately but I think you \nget what I'm saying then it's a really \ninteresting idea because you can you can \nbasically tweak things to to give better \nresults and I think it's it's almost \nlike the opposite approach of what I \nsuggested where rather than optimize the \nquery once you figure out what the \naccess pattern is going to be you can \nthen kind of tweak it \num what you're almost describing to me \nsounds kind of like a like a recursive \nfeedback loop along like okay we have \nour initial chunks we put a bunch of \nstuff in them now we have this feedback \nloop built out and we see how people use \nthis let's \num you know let's alter these chunks \nlet's continue to evolve them where I \nsee some complexity associated with this \nis \nit's my expectation that what's in the \nvector database is not going to be \nstatic \num I think there's some scenarios where \npeople will ingest stuff once but I \nthink one of the problems that we're \nseeing is more like you have to sync \ndata you have to ingest stuff like one \nof the things we're building in a vector \nflow is like a dedupe mechanism so the \nidea that you're not gonna um you know \nadd duplicate vectors when you have to \nupdate and so how would this idea of \nhaving a feedback loop that alters the \ncore uh you know embedding in the \ndatabase play with the fact that you \nalso need to like constantly refresh \ndata in a production system \nyeah it sounds it is it sounds really \nexciting I mean I guess it's like maybe \nyour queries tell you something about \nthe data you didn't originally that like \nmaybe the queries are telling you just \nlike to add this kind of filter like \nlook for this kind of thing particularly \nbecause I'm seeing this feedback where \nthey like these kind of answers I kind \nof like that long tail versus the \npopularity kind of thing and yeah I \ndon't know exactly but I think really \nthe the the the key thing and how this \nties into like how you think about how \nyou import data is like um just probably \nuh I guess it's there there's definitely \nlike levers of control here like with \nthe um so kind of coming back to like \nthe self-driving databases in more of an \nSQL sense is like you can build up \ncertain index structures for different \nkind of properties but then speed up the \nlatency of making those kind of queries \nand Vector search has a similar kind of \nanalog with the hsw graph where uh if \nyou know that you're always going to be \ndoing this one kind of filtered search \nyou can like increase the connectivity \nof that kind of surf so you know we the \nway that filtered hsw filtered search in \nhsw is implemented is you have like an \nallow list and it says traversing the \ngraph and it's saying you know are you \non the allow list well no okay well I'm \nstill going to explore your neighbors \nbut you're not going to be in the result \nset and so if you know that you're doing \na particular kind of filtered search all \nthe time you could kind of connect those \nfilters and then that allow list will \nyou know be pop you know the result list \nwill be populated quicker and so you'll \nhave a faster latency \nso I see that kind of angle to it where \nyou're just trying to speed it up by by \nyou know what queries you're having so \nyou're going to index in advance but but \nthen there's maybe something to like \nthe queries tell you something about the \ninformation that causes you to think \nokay I need to change uh the information \nthat's in my chunks or like something \nlike that \nyeah I mean no it's definitely an \ninteresting idea I mean I'm just kind of \nthinking out loud here that like you \nknow \nif you have the capacity to do it like \nyour organization you know you can you \ncan afford to have multiple different \nuh versions of the data stored right \nlike you could even think about having \nthings in different actual graphs and \nsome sort of proxy layer in front of the \ndatabase that kind of decides at runtime \nlike which which index you want to hit \num I'm just kind of trying to connect \nthe dots with like I know traditional \ndatabases have proxies that do a lot of \ninteresting things it's more I think on \nthe performance side like connection \nthere sharing and things like that but \nlike could you combine this idea of like \nthe kind of self-driving database with \nthe proxy layer that that provides the \nyou know a smart interface \num \nto to actually make the the results \nas good as possible \nyeah no I that sounds really exciting to \nme because you like coming back to the \nhnsw thing like having two separate \nclasses one class is like this you know \noptimized for filtered searches and the \nother one is just the ordinary hsw and \nyou have like these two classes and you \nknow you have this kind of proxy \norchestrator that's saying you know I'm \nnot getting enough filter to search this \nanymore let me go ahead and destroy that \nbecause the memory overhead doesn't make \nit worthwhile anymore and \nyeah I did I think there's a lot to that \nI I think it's a pretty interesting kind \nof Direction and I the reason I think it \nmight be relevant to you know Vector \nflow and managing Imports is I think a \nlot about this kind of like uh \ndegenerative feedback loops and you know \nthis is Bob's idea I'm just like sharing \nit but like this like um having like a \nrest API around the generative feedback \nloop that would um you know like so like \none example is like when you're \ngenerating synthetic data from your for \nfor your task or whatever you every like \n10 you might want to like back up your \ndatabase because you're paying for these \nLM inferences you want to you know save \nit if you potentially have it crash but \nuh if I save it every 10 and you know \nnow I have like the the newest one after \n100 it's like go ahead and delete those \n90. that's kind of like the \ninfrastructure management task I see is \nlike okay I don't need these backups \nanymore go ahead and delete them it's \nkind of like like a garbage collector \nfor the data backups so I could see that \nkind of thing being managed by an \nexternal service rather than leviate \nitself \nyeah that makes sense I mean I think in \ngeneral it's kind of like the difference \nbetween the vector store and sort of \nthis whole Vector Ops life cycle \num and that's part of it along with just \non you know it goes into \num understanding when you want to \nrefresh the data and that's a big part \nof ingestion as well and so I think I \nthink the way that you see \num tooling built up around traditional \ndatabases I expect you'll see tooling \nbuilt up around Vector databases to help \npeople get the most out of out of those \nsystems I'm curious kind of like what \nare you guys sort of encountering on um \nthe the sort of educational side of \nthings because we're talking about all \nthese capabilities that we see and how \nwe could see stuff evolving but one of \nthe things I sort of notice in a lot of \nthe discussions that I have is that \npeople still need to really be \nintroduced to the idea of like what can \nyou really do with the vector database \nand why do you need to put it into your \ninto your system architecture \num so I'm curious like how do you see \nthis becoming more more approachable \nto like the general kind of community \nsoftware engineering community as a \nwhole \num well it may hopefully not too \nredundant but I do think that kind of \nthe zero shot model like what makes it \nmore accessible is the zero shot models \nsorry let me can I ask you one more \nquestion before we come into this topic \nis sure quickly I just wanted to ask \nabout uh the gbt cash idea where you you \ntake llm responses and then you cache \nthem and so now you take a new answer \nand a new question and you would map it \nto its nearest uh like you take a new \nprompt you map it to its nearest prompt \nthat's already been answered and then \nyou give them that answer and so I so \nsorry to let me like cut so back into \nthis conversation sorry if you don't I \njust I just want to get this last song \nand then we'll yeah and then I'd love to \ncome into the topic of how do you \nevangelize Vector databases but like \nthis um yeah gbt Cache is like uh you \nknow the llm does some kind of response \nwith your data and then you save it it's \nso it is like a generative feedback loop \nwhere you save it back in the database \nbut it's for the sake of you know \nquestion answering in the future sure \nyeah have you seen this kind of gbt \ncache thing yeah we actually looked into \nit um when we were first exploring like \nyou know different ways to deal with \nsome of these problems because like you \nknow you do part of getting the best \nperformance out of the vector database \nis like you know probably to do some \ncaching so that you don't have to hit it \nright tons of traditional systems have \ncaching of of one sort or another I \nthink the trick is like to to do smart \ncaching in a way that's not really \nexpensive or really burdensome in terms \nof the memory \num I think that's where actually this \nidea of like a zero shot llm that is \ndesigned specifically to to kind of do \nsemantic caching could be really \ninteresting where it's like you don't \nactually have to hit chat GPT maybe you \ncould have a a model that's you know \nmore parameter light that could even run \nyou know like on a much smaller device \nlike not on a GPU that just enables that \nto be really efficient because it's not \nthe problem right is it's not like a \ntraditional cash where you can have \num like a key Value Store you need to \nreally be smart about how you decide to \ncash \nand and what you decide to cash \nI it's interesting that that kind of key \nValue Store analog because I I know a \nlot of like you know researchers think \nof like you know deep learning is just \nlike glorified hash tables and you could \nthink of embeddings as kind of like a \nkey hash and so it is it kind of relates \nto that idea but I guess the the thing \nabout gbt cash and how I'm seeing most \npeople using it right now that I find to \nbe interesting with this more like \nautonomous self-driving database kind of \nconcept is like usually gbt cache is \ntriggered by a real person came and \nasked a real question and this is the \nreal answer that they liked therefore in \nthe future let's use that answer again \nwhereas imagining like an llm that's \njust like you know prompting itself with \nyour documents and creating more \ninformation and like would you ever want \nto return that information that's \ncreated by an out like an llm retrieves \nlike two parts of your documentation and \nit says I don't know write a comparison \nof these two or like think about how you \nmight combine like if it you take like \nAtomic apis and it's like how might you \nwrite a compositional API of these apis \nand and it creates like new data and \nwould and would you want to then index \nthat and maybe return that for a search \nso if I understand what you're saying \nare you basically saying like you you \nuse the Ln to populate the cache kind of \nit's like so yeah yeah \nyeah definitely an interesting idea I \nmean I think you'd have to like somehow \nhave some some human feedback in the \nsystem that's something we actually it's \na topic we've kind of skipped in this in \nthis podcast maybe the next one we'll \ntalk about it \nuh come into this system but it's \ncertainly an interesting idea and I \nthink it goes well with the general \ntheme of like at some point once these \nTechnologies mature you'll be able to \nkind of use them for recursive sort of \nimprovements where they can just make \nthem look better with some some human \nguidance and I think that the idea of \napplying that to cash is definitely an \ninteresting mechanism as opposed to like \nyou know the more crude caching \nstrategies that we have now you know \nlike least recently used and you know \nputting time and cash and having maybe \nbetter ways to assess like what really \nneeds to be stored hmm \nyeah yeah I love this topic it was such \na fun conversation and yeah I I think \nthere's so many interesting topics about \nall that and I think yeah I do like I \nthink this kind of external uh document \nmanager outside of wevia could eat up a \nlot of a lot of functionally what this \nkind of stuff ends up looking like but \nyeah let's take the step back I know \nthis is like dreaming into the future I \njust like I always like doing that but \nthis kind of topic of um you know how do \nyou evangelize these new technologies I \nmean maybe let me first ask you where \nyour head's obviously you know you're \nstarting this new company Vector flow \nand you know trying to you know get off \nthe ground get some content get some \nusers and all that is maybe like yeah \nhow do you see that in your focus and \nhow are you currently thinking about it \nyeah I mean I think it's um I think for \nus we're really trying to more \nunderstand the axis patterns around \nVector databases right now and that's \nwhy I was saying like you know we're \nstill waiting to see how those mature \nlike what are the common like we talked \nabout metadata what are the common \nfields or you know like what are the \ncommon data sources what are the common \nformats what are what are the main kind \nof issues that you're encountering with \ningestion because I think Vector flow is \ndesigned really to be sort of this \num like let's get to production quickly \ntype technology \num \nbut I think there's one of the things \nthat we're seeing is a lot of people \nusing llms that just don't really fully \nunderstand the power of semantic search \nand the wide variety of use cases right \nlike people know about to some extent \nlike this idea of ask questions of your \ndata but for example a lot of people \ndon't know that like you need to use uh \nsemantic searches for example in facial \nrecognition or like I was actually \nthinking this morning about how like \nthey maybe could use it for inspecting \nrocket parts right because like these \nRockets have I think I want to say this \nis a number off the top of my head but I \nwant to say there's like two million \nParts like Falcon and rocket and it's \nvery precise and like what's the \ndifference between a test part versus a \nflight part like it's minute and could a \nconventional model by itself just doing \ninference detect that or would you also \nwant to do some kind of more complicated \nsimilarity search I'm kind of going down \na rabbit hole here but it's like \npeople still don't know about the broad \napplicability so I do feel like there is \nsome degree of Education that we have to \ndo as well because we are a pipeline \nthat is dependent on Technologies like \nLevy so people need to first know like \nwell what should I be using bb8 for it's \nlike oh okay I need that well yeah and \nalso like oh that makes sense and if I \nwant to get stuff in easily and get to \nproduction quickly like oh Vector flow \nyeah yeah that that um that inspect the \nuh rocket parts that that's one of the \nuse cases I've seen with levia that just \nalways stuck in my brain is um it was uh \nAirline manuals and like searching \nthrough a particular kind of \nconfiguration of that it just it always \nmotivates me to talk about this metadata \nthing and grounds my thinking and \nchunking just because of seeing what \nthat kind of thing ends up looking like \nbut yeah so exploring all the different \nuse cases that can exist of uh you know \nVector search technology very broadly I \nI completely agree I think like I don't \nthink we have a good sense of what \nmultimodal retrieval augmented \ngeneration is going to look like yet \nwhere you know I imagine it in the \ne-commerce case where I'm like you know \nshow me what I would look like with a \nwhite pocket hat it's something like \nthis like where it retrieves the images \nof me and it like fuses that with the \nimage search of bucket hats and it like \ncombines these like this kind of \ncombination of like um modalities in \nretrieval augmented systems that yeah \nthe applications certainly are still \ngrowing yeah well I I would like to \npitch you one more thing kind of like \nfuture looking thing about what I think \nis going to heavily impact how you \nevangelize Technologies broadly is the \ngorilla large language models so with \nthe gorilla large language models what I \nwould imagine a user doing is you tell \nme a little bit about your data like \nyour data Maybe gorilla designs a schema \nfor you and then you say okay build me \nan ingestion flow from my notion to \nleviate using Vector flow and gorilla is \nan llm specialized on the apis that you \nknow like levia in Vector flow \ncollectively build and gorilla does all \nthe intermediate stuff so like you know \nwriting all the python code for doing \nthis \nyeah what do you think about that kind \nof idea I mean it's definitely an \ninteresting idea I mean I think like \nit'd be interesting to see how that \nwould fit with Vector flow because our \nwhole like one of our overarching design \nprinciples with sector flow is like to \nto just try to limit system complexity \nand it's definitely a challenge because \num you there are a lot of things that \nyou need to tweak and so our idea is \nlike minimizing how much code you have \nto write having you know just a simple \nAPI endpoint or a config file and so I \nthink um if there's a way to even remove \nthat complexity it gets you to \nproduction faster I think the other \nthing like vector flow is really useful \nfor testing right we were talking about \nlike the need for more kind of \nformalized testing strategies and um the \nidea that you you probably need to to \nreally figure out which hyper parameters \nwork best for your retrieval system you \nneed to test a lot of things in \ningestion so this idea of the gorilla \nmodel just enabling you to go through \nthat cycle really quickly or even doing \nit for you could be super super cool it \ncould basically just remove a lot of \nlike more grunty aspects of setting up \nthese systems in figuring out exactly \nhow well uh like the best way to make \nthem play nicely together I think is a \nsuper interesting idea \nyeah because I think like with Vector \nflow you know you're going to create \nthese this documentation that shows you \nhow to do the particular syntax and then \nif you have a language model that I can \njust tell you like you know roughly what \nI want to do and it just translates it \ninto the vector flow apis now the \nlearning curve for me a new Vector flow \nuser becomes a lot lower \nI think for weviate and like you know \nit's a bit more interest like we it's \npretty interesting because like for us \nlike uh users need to learn like the \nsearch API so like you need to learn the \nsyntax to like put two filters on your \nvector search query and so that \nparticularly that language of being like \nadd these two filters and it generates \nthe graphql that that excites me a ton \nyou know it's kind of like the text SQL \nstuff but yeah \nbecause I feel like it just when you're \nevangelizing your new technology you \nhave this like learning curve like you \nknow learn my syntax learn my new you \nknow my library that kind of thing \nyeah definitely I think that's that's \nwhy we we're we tried to stick with HTTP \nas the first way like an entry point \ninto the system \num but it's there's a lot of different \nthings to tweak for example like you \nknow a lot of traditional tools like \nallow you to pass in Python scripts to \nrun specific \num Transformations and I think one of \nthe things that we are exploring \nactively right now is like what is what \nis the main flow you know and what is \nwhat what where are the real barriers to \nto entry in terms of getting things to \nproduction we know that one of those is \ninfrastructure which is why \num you know we're building what we're \nbuilding but I think anything that \nreduces that friction whether it's a \nlarge language model or just you know a \nwell done integration between two \nsystems I think is ultimately going to \nallow people to extract a lot more in \nvalue from these systems \nyeah yeah I agree 100 yeah and I just \nthink kind of the thinking about the \nfuture of what these Integrations are \ngoing to look like is pretty exciting \nlike how yeah like you you mentioned \nlike HTTP and like networking protocols \nand it's I guess it's almost like that \nlike if language is the interface now \nbetween all software tools for \nintegration sort of like how you know \nHTTP requests are the interface between \nlike networking endpoints it's and \nthat's kind of how I see the future of \nthat kind of part of it but yeah anyway \nso yeah I love talking about the \nGuerrilla language models because I just \nthink it's a pretty cool topic but \nanyways uh David thank you so much for \njoining the weba podcast \nyeah I I really liked our kind of \ninitial tour of like jointly \nunderstanding the end to end of \nimporting from you know connecting these \ndifferent data sources the kind of \nmetadata chunking visual document \nparsing all those that kind of topics \nand then how do you vectorize and then I \nguess the the last networking to get it \ninto the database it's such an exciting \nspace and you know thanks to the \nconversation around the self-driving \ndatabases generate a feedback loop I had \nso much fun discussing that and you know \nthank you so much good luck with \neverything yeah thank you so much for \nI'm super super cool to do a discussion \nlike this where you just um you know \nyou're in certain ways \num getting a very specific exposure that \nI love to hear that the new ideas that \ncome up and then we can chew on those \nand think about how we could put them \ninto our system so it's a lot of fun \nsuper excited to see uh what happens in \nthe space \n", "type": "Video", "name": "David Garnitz on VectorFlow - Weaviate Podcast #66!", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efAvOsO8Gik", "timestamp": "", "reader":
