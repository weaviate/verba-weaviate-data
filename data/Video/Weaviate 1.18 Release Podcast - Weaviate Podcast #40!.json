{"text": "Thank you so much for tuning in to another Weaviate Release podcast! Weaviate 1.18 is packed with new features! Bitmap ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching another weeviate release \npodcast I'm super excited about Ouija \n1.18 the big theme of this is being \nspeed memory savings some ux \nimprovements like adding filters to \nhybrid search uh so I'm super excited to \nwelcome we've a CTO and co-founder Eddie \nand dylocker to explain some of the new \nupdates to Eva 1.18 \nhey Connor thanks for having me \nawesome so we have such an exciting list \nfrom bitmap indexing and update to hsw \nwith adding product quantization and \nthen the wand algorithm for bm25 and \nhybrid search so can we kick things off \nby diving into bitmap indexing and \nwhat's new about that yeah sure bitmap \nindexing is is one of those things that \nthe first time we saw it was almost too \ngood to be true \num I think at some point I I tweeted out \nwhere we had like a thousand times a \nspeed Improvement on filter query and \nthat was not just some marketing stuff \nthat was really we had a filter in a \nspecific combination on 100 million uh \ndata set where a filter could take uh I \nthink something like five seconds and \nnow that same filter would take five \nmilliseconds so it's really a 1 000 \ntimes Improvement and the idea is \nbasically we use for for filtering we \nuse the inverted index and the inverted \nindex is basically the the ground truth \nof what is allowed or disallowed and \nthen we pass that we call internally we \ncall it an allow list we pass that allow \nlist to the hnsw index and say like hey \nthese are the X number of objects that \nyou are allowed to to use in your search \nbasically \num and the problem there was if a filter \nsuddenly matches the entire database on \n100 million objects then you would have \nor you would spend so much time building \nup that filter from the inverted index \nthat all of a sudden like even if the \nvector search for for a filter that \nmatches the entire database the vector \nsearch doesn't really care right it's \nlike it's almost the same as an \nunfiltered one or it is the same as \nnon-filtered one if it matches literally \neverything in the database but that mere \nfact of building up the filter that took \nso much time and then we thought okay \nwhat what's going on what what is uh \nhappening with our current \nimplementation and what could we improve \nand we came across roaring bitmaps which \nis basically a a perfect sort of fit \nbecause bitmaps or bit sets in general \nare made exactly for this like is \nsomething contained yes no and uh it \nworks with with basically with \nincreasing IDs which is exactly what we \nhave because with the inverted index \nalready so perfect fit only problem \nthere was \num that sort of if you store your your \ninverted index in a specific way and \nthen you convert it into a roaring \nbitmap which is what some other \ndatabases do then you still have that \ncost of storing it in a in a different \nway basically you still have that \nretrieval cost and we said hey there's \nthis one thing and and that's that's \nanother tweet that I put out where at \nsome point I said like we made that \ncrazy decision to basically build \neverything from scratch in nvidate and \nand that is one of the points where it \nreally really pays off right now because \nwe just put those roaring bitmaps \nstraight into the storage layer like in \nour LSM store itself and that means we \nwe don't have to do any kind of \num and he kind of retrieve then turn \ninto a bitmap so so so for example \num if you you could do it that way if \nyou had um say a classical storage \nengine that would just Store The Roaring \nbitmap then you could still sort of \nretrieve the Roaring bitmap and you \ncould do fast intersections like for an \nand or or operations once you have the \nbitmap that would still be fast but \nyou'd always have that that cost up \nfront but because we could build it \nstraight into the LSM Store that cost is \ncompletely gone and that gives us \nlatencies in the in the single digit \nmilliseconds for that that Filter part \nso I think on the the 100 million was um \nour evaluation case because there before \nwe ran into those five second latencies \nand then on that same case now a simple \nfilter that matches everything is \nsomething like a millisecond or maybe \ntwo and then even if you have like some \ncomplex operations like like range \nqueries or or merging different filters \nthis and that or that like with multiple \noperands that's all super fast right now \nwhich is is incredibly cool \num one more thing to say about this \num of course this is this is a very \ndifferent way of storing and handling \ndata in VBA in 1.18 than it was in 1.17 \nso listeners might now think wow what do \nI have to do like is that is that going \nto break my my entire VBA instance the \ngood news is no it's not so if you don't \ndo anything if you just upgrade to 1.18 \nit will just fall back to what it's \nalready what it's already used to but \nthen you also won't have the speed \nbenefits but we also have a migration \noption which you can basically run one \ntime you just start a bb8 with an option \nsay like hey migrate my my index is to \nRoaring bitmap indexes and then it will \nrun through your objects once basically \nwith the first time it starts up and vv8 \nwill be in in read-only mode during that \nphase because of course when it rebuilds \nthe entire index then you can't have \nrights coming in but you can still use \nit normally it's it's only read-only and \nonce that is complete a readout only \nmode is gone and you have the benefits \nof super fast filters in VBA 1.18 with \nyour data that you imported in in 1.17 \n. yeah that's extremely interesting and \nyeah that detail is super cool that you \ndon't that you can just kind of update \nit and um yeah so maybe kind of coming \nback into the application and motivating \na little further I remember like reading \nyour article about pre-filled about \npre-filtered uh Vector search and 50 \nmilliseconds and this kind of thing and \nI always thought initially this idea of \nadding symbolic filters to the vector \nsearch was such an interesting idea \nlearning more about how you use this \nallow list structure with the hsw like \nhow technically that's implemented so \nmaybe kind of talking a bit about the \napplications and the tests a little more \num I really like these things like when \nwe interviewed Sam bean from you.com he \ndescribed this idea of like a vertically \nintegrated search engine so say you want \nto search through just Reddit or just \nWikipedia that's one case where you then \nwould put this filter on the vector \nsearch and maybe if we could just talk \nthrough some more examples of filtered \nVector search and what that looks like \nyeah that that's a great example \num one that I always think of because I \nthink where where users are most used to \nfilters is e-commerce like if you order \nsomething from a web shop you would \nlet's say you would filter the price \nrange because you want your object to \nmatch a specific price range or you \nwould filter it by a specific uh product \nattributes so if you're looking for a \nnew uh VBA t-shirt it has to be navy \nblue and then you put navy blue on it \nand then you'll you'll get the the right \none \num not not for me I only wear black \nshirts I guess \num no but but these are these are the \nkind of applications where users are so \nused to applying filters maybe without \neven being aware of it because it's just \nit's just natural and then yeah as you \nsaid I really like this idea of having a \nmassive data set and sort of narrowing \nit down on the Fly you're saying well \nnow I just want to filter by yeah only \nonly search through through Reddit for \nexample and um by having that that sort \nof big Vector space and having the \nability to set those filters on the Fly \nyou also don't necessarily need to know \nup front right because you could also \nsay if say a vector search engine \nwouldn't support filtering you could \njust say okay I'm going to split it up \nup front I'm just going to here is my \ncollection for Reddit here's my \ncollection for uh I don't know the next \nthing \num and then you search them one at a \ntime but that only works if you can \npredict entirely what these kind of \ncombinations are but if you can \ndynamically sort of combine these \nfilters and that is also something that \nthat that vv8 already supports but that \nwill be way faster with bitmap indexing \njust because it's so cheap such a cheap \noperation to do like an intersection on \na on two bitmaps basically so you can do \nthat dynamically so it gives you sort of \nmore uh flexibility later on like yes \nthere are cases where you maybe want to \noptimize something by splitting \nsomething up up front like I'm not not \nsaying that those don't exist like in \nthose hyper optimized cases for when you \nuse case but in the general just throw \nsomething at it let VBA deal with it and \nfigure out what you want to do later \nwithout being sort of blocked by a \nprevious decision that's that's nice and \nthat's going to be much faster now than \nit was before \nyeah that example of uh chaining \ntogether the wear filters is so \ninteresting like uh Navy like a t-shirt \nnavy blue uh price between 20 and 40 \ndollars I'm not sure how much a sure it \ncosts but but we're using my shirt but \nyeah so another question I got uh when I \nwas at the New York Meetup we get Meetup \nwas about role-based access control uh \nwould this enable that \ninteresting interesting uh question yeah \nso so yes and no so \num there \nif you want to do \nor it depends a bit sort of where you do \nyour role-based access course so maybe \nfor for people who aren't aware \nrole-based access control is basically a \nvery fine-grained Access Control \nmechanism where different users have \ndifferent roles and then one role grants \nyou rights to specific things so \nbasically by default you have no rights \nto do anything but then you could have \nright it could have specific roles and \nbasically through those roles you \ninherit permissions to to access \nsomething whatever that something is \nthat could be something in in the \ncontext of of the application could be \nsomething in the context of a vv8 \nbasically a specific object so if you do \nset such a property on your vv8 object \nand then in your application you would \nmake sure that you \num that you set those filters to match \nthe specific either the specific roles \nor the specific permissions you could \ndefinitely do that with with those \nfilters the sort of downs are maybe not \ndownside is just so if it's a it's an \nengineering decision and it has \ntrade-offs and basically what you need \nto do then is make sure that the user \ncan never find a path where they can \nbasically skip that kind of filter \nbecause like if if for example there was \na way that they could all of a sudden \nhave an unfiltered search and they would \nthey would search across \num basically everyone's data which is of \ncourse what you want to prevent so um \ndepending on your kind of security \nrequirements it may also make sense to \nhave the the role-based access control \ndirectly in the database and not sort of \non top of it but that that that's \nbasically that that you need to decide \nthat from a use case to use case \nperspective perspective of how you would \nwant to integrate this this by the way \nalso a question that also comes up um \nevery once in a while and I've been \nmeaning to write a blog post about it \nbut I haven't yet is multi-tenancy \nbecause I guess sort of the the \nrole-based access control is very \nsimilar to to the multi-tenancy case \nwhere you would have \num say your users are grouped by \nsomething and then how do you represent \nthose user groups or their companies or \nwhatever it is that Associates them to \none thing how do you group that in bb8 \nand typically \num what we do there is we do it on a on \na class basis because that sort of gives \nyou and and that's why I'm bringing this \nup as opposed to doing it in a sort of \nMonolithic large class and then set \nindividual filters if you have it per \nclass then you have that separation like \nthe the way that a class is created in \nmediate it's very it's like everything \nis isolated basically it's it's a \nseparate folder on disk it's separate \nfiles on disk and there's basically no \nway that that one tenant could influence \nanother attendant \nbut that said multi-tenancy is also not \nthe exact same thing as a sort of \nfine-grained access control so but but \nthese topics overlap so I thought that \nwas \nthat would be worth mentioning as well \nat that point yeah that's extremely \ninteresting so I think that's a great \ncoverage of uh bitmap indexing um you \nknow beginning with the technical \ndetails and then you know talking about \nthe applications the filtered search and \nI yeah just I think it's important for \npeople to know that you can filter the \nvector search it's not just Vector \nsearch you can also add these symbolic \nproperties add things to your data like \nyou would with any kind of data \nmanagement system and you can achieve \nfaster Vector search by filtering with \nthe properties and that's probably one \nof the most exciting things that we've \nin my opinion I love this kind of filter \nVector search thing uh so so then \nstepping into the meat of the vector \nsearch the vector index so H and swpq \nwhat does product quantization add to \nthe table \nyeah such a such a cool big topic and \nI'm so happy that we we finally have the \nuh the first release so I think we we \nteased something late last year already \nwhen when all of us were together in \nItaly and this was one of our our \npresentations that we had there \num where the overarching goal is \nbasically to reduce the operating cost \nwhich is mainly driven by by memory \nconsumption so sort of goes hand in hand \nlike if you want to look at it from Tech \nperspective we want to reduce memory \nusage if you want to look from the \nbusiness perspective we want to reduce \noperating costs but really it's the same \nthing \num that was driven by by sort of okay \nhow can we get the the usage down \nbasically without without sort of any \nmaking any sacrifices I mean what you \ncould do is turn off the vector index \nlike that would that would reduce your \nmemory index but it would also make it \nkind of pointless to to use VBA \num so so yeah how can we give the same \nkind of uh uh quality to the user while \nmaking it a bit cheaper to run and there \nwe have basically this this two-step \napproach to it in hnswpq is that the \nfirst step the two step or the second \nstep starting with the the sort of \nlonger goal is a fully disk based \nsolution so disk based solution \nbasically means what's on disk doesn't \nhave to be in memory so therefore it's \nit's cheaper and ssds are fast and if \nyou optimize it for ssds there are \ncertain ways where you can you can make \nbenefits off those disks and still have \na very similar \num experience \nthat said there's also sort of like you \nyou can you can never run any kind of \nprogram without memory right like if \nevery little thing was loaded from disk \nthe minute or the second or the \nmillisecond or nanosecond that it was \nused it would become very very slow so \nyou can basically put parts to disk and \nyou keep some parts in memory and put \nsome parts to disk and the kind of idea \nin any disk based system so so Abdel for \nexample published this comparison of \nvamana which is what what Microsoft's \ndisk and uses which technically is quite \nsimilar to hnsw because it's also graph \nbased single layer graph instead of \nmulti-layered graph but it's still still \nvery very similar so basically with all \nof these systems you need to keep \nsomething in memory and and the idea is \nyou keep sort of something small and \ncheap in memory and have the large \ninexpensive stuff put to to disk and now \nto loop back sort of what is the the \nsmall and cheap stuff that you can keep \nin memory and what you find in all of \nthese these ideas is compressed vectors \nand this is where product quantization \ncomes in so we had matiz Do's on on the \npodcast uh who which is basically just \ndiv dive into into product quantization \nso he explained this way better than \nthan I could and then I could in in like \n30 seconds but the general idea is that \nthat product quantization is a form of \ncompression it's lost full compression \nso it's not lossless compressions Lost \nfull compression and you can tune it um \nin in the simplest case you would have \num a single float 32 Dimension which was \nwhich originally in the continuous \nVector is four bytes would be turned \ninto a single byte so we you'd have a \nfour to one compression but then you can \nyou can basically compress it further by \nhaving a multiple multiple Dimensions \nper segment so you could get to like \neight to one sixty to one thirty two to \none \num and this comes at the cost of \ndropping recall so as with anything \nthere's some sort of a sweet spot which \nis if you if you want to have the exact \nsame kind of quality as you have with \nhnsw right now then The Sweet Spot is \nprobably four to one compression \num but if you say well I care less about \nrecall I care about running billions of \nvectors cheaply then maybe your personal \nsweet spot is at eight to one or sixteen \nto one or thirty two to one and where \nabdell is currently working on a blog \npost \num illustrating these these kind of kind \nof trade-offs anyway long story short \num compression is a vital part of any \ndisk based system and we we thought well \nwe we we're currently developing this \ndisk based system and it has a certain \ntimeline but can we create value for the \nuser sooner than that and then we \nthought like well \nhnswpq is basically half of this picnics \nlike the 50 of this skin and it has the \ncompression it still has the the uh the \nvector index and the only difference \nreally is that the the vector index is \nstill in memory and not on disk but the \nvectors if they are compressed four to \none then fictional example let's say \nyour current memory usage is 10 \ngigabytes of those 10 gigabytes two is \nthe vector index and eight are the the \nvector embeddings then \num and now I'm glad I chose round \nnumbers that are easy to calculate then \nif you compress those eight gigabytes of \nvectors uh by four to one and then they \nwould turn into two so basically your um \nyou still have the two gigabytes for the \nvector index plus the two gigabytes for \nthe compressed vectors so instead of 10 \ngigabytes overall you now have four \ngigabytes so you basically had a sixty \npercent reduction in memory usage and \nfour to one is such a low compression \nthat you're probably not even going to \nnotice the the the um the drop in recall \nso it's like almost almost free almost \nfor free you've got a 60 reduction in \ncost and then said you can drive it even \nfurther \nyeah that's incredible and ABDO has done \nsuch an incredible job with this blog \npost I'm not sure if this is uh the blog \npost is published when we're publishing \nthis but I highly recommend people \nchecking this out uh this blog post \nreally helped me firstly understand the \nmemory requirements of hsw uh the blog \npost describes the calculations of uh \nwith hnsw you have this Max connections \nparameter and then you have to store \nthis number of parameter uh connections \nand with like n16 and describing the \ndetails of what that creates an overhead \nas well as the compressed Vector as your \ncalculation with the eight gigabytes two \ngigabytes and that reduction um yeah and \nthen I really liked what you said about \nlike if your goal is just to run a \nbillion vectors compared to a million \nwith the recall trade-offs uh basically \nyou have this decision of whether how \nyou want to group the vectors so like if \nthis is a 32 dimensional Vector you you \nknow segments of two right and so that's \nthat's how whether you increase that \nyou'll compress it more but at the cost \nof lower recall and it comes back to \nthat I think a n benchmarks thing you \ndid with the you know showing the recall \nof approximate nearest Neighbors \nyeah I think all that is just so \ninteresting um something I'm really \ncurious about is explaining further the \num the K means and how that's used to \nCluster the vectors and kind of what the \noverhead and the thinking is behind that \nyeah so for for the compression \nalgorithm basically to reduce the amount \nof data you need to sort of build groups \nyou you just uh said that example of \ntaking two dimensions and putting them \ninto into like groups of two so then the \nquestions becomes what identifies a \ngroup like how do you pick your groups \nbecause you could pick them very very \nbad basically where the distance between \ntwo points in a single group would be \nvery large and then if you put all of \nyour your groups served on top of each \nother in a graph all your groups would \nsuddenly be identical and then you'd \nhave the problem that that well what's \nthe point of having this many groups if \nthey're all the same so basically you \nneed to to pick your groups for and \nwithout going too deep into what uh how \nproduct quantization works under the \nhood but basically you need to \ndistribute your data in groups that have \nno overlap and where something that's \nwithin a group is actually similar \nbecause if you if you use that for \napproximation \num then yeah if if it's dissimilar then \nbasically you you that's why you recall \ndrops and k-means is a very simple \nclustering algorithm to that basically \ndoes exactly that so if you imagine all \nyour your vectors like a 2d graph plot \nit somewhere there are naturally going \nto be clusters and then k-means is just \nan algorithm that identifies those \nclusters and it's it's by no means \nperfect but um it has like a an exit \ncondition basically where it stops \nrunning if it can't improve further \num and then you have ways to to \num sort of run it over and over again to \nto find like the the the best possible \nclusters and that is essentially what's \nused in PQ these kind of kind of it's \nlike the I would say the initialization \nin PQ is is this K means uh or these K \nmeans clusters because these clusters \nthen represent the individual segments \nin in um in product quantization and uh \nthen something that that I think that \nwill also be uh mentioned in uh abdel's \nblog post or has been mentioned \ndepending on whether it's been published \nalready \num \nyou don't need you don't necessarily \nneed all your vectors to produce good PQ \nproduce a good PQ code book or good uh \nPQ clusters so in the example that he \nruns in his blog post I think he uses 20 \nof the data and um then it runs under \nthe assumption that the remaining 80 of \nthe data is distributed in a similar way \nas the initial 20 and like this this \nassumption becomes true depending on the \nsize that data set and of course if you \nif you think of um \nyeah if you think of your your data set \nin real life topics if your first 20 \nhappen to be about \num navy blue vv8 t-shirts and then your \nremaining 80 percenter all of a sudden \nabout a car parts or something \nthen that distribution that that \nassumption doesn't doesn't hold true but \ntypically that's not the case like \ntypically you have like a slice of your \ndata that's somewhat distributed and \nthen if you add a like a light blue \nt-shirt then it makes sense that that \nyou would find the existing group for \nfor the light blue t-shirt and then if \nyou add a new uh I don't know headlight \nthen the headlight the LED headlight \nwould be close to the the \nwhatever incandescent headlight that's \nalready in the not sure if they're still \nused anymore \nbut uh yeah it kind of runs under the \nassumption that um \nthese clusters still make sense and \ntypically they do which is nice \nyeah that that notion of like \ndistribution shift and how it applies to \nVector index structures are super \ninteresting I've read this paper Ood \ndisk a n that yeah touches on this \nproblem and I definitely think that'll \nbe something that uh to keep an eye on I \nI found that find the k-means thing to \nbe so interesting uh like for example we \nwere comparing k-means with umap on our \nBert topic podcast and in the case of \nBert topic you're trying to Cluster \nVector spaces to understand the \nsimilarity between clusters so uh so \nk-means has a bias on trying to evenly \ndistribute the space with the centroids \nwhich makes a ton of sense for product \nquantization because you're trying to \ncompress the vectors with the centroid \nIDs so it works great for that whereas \numap is better for like if you want to \nhave some odd shape where Martin uses \nthis example where it's like a circle \nwith a dot in the middle and K means \nwould just try to like cut that up \nrather than um \nyou know clustering the circle around \nthe dot so it's very interesting to \nthink of the trade-offs between the \nclustering algorithms is very cool to \nsee the k-means implementation in go \nLang and leviate and seeing the \nclustering coming as a part of the \nvector uh analysis stuff as well so so \nawesome so I think that's so exciting \nthe opportunities with reducing the \nmemory requirements of vector indexes \nand yeah all that making it more \naccessible to create billion scale maybe \nif we like dream a bit about this like \nhow much how much can these kind of \nsavings help people with you know \nscaling up their clusters or the things \nthey imagine doing but limited with the \ncost and thus needing optimizations like \nthis yeah yeah I I think the the biggest \nuh sort of enabler or this is going to \nbe a big enabler for cases that don't \nnecessarily have a lot of traffic but \nhave large data sets so if you think of \nthe other data let's say someone's \nbuilding a new type of search engine and \nthat would hit millions of requests per \nsecond they would probably probably not \nmind that the setup is relatively \nexpensive because just to be able to \nserve millions of requests per second \nyou need large infrastructure anyway so \nit doesn't matter if the memory \nrequirement is a bit higher because you \nhave I don't know tens or hundreds of \nCPUs anyway so that kind of goes hand in \nhand but for those cases that are maybe \nand I think we also find them a lot in \nthe sort of more analytical space and \nmaybe on the research side where you \nhave a massive data set but your \nrequirement is not necessarily to get \nlike real-time information if the query \ntakes a bit longer you do it async \nthat's fine your your goal is basically \nto get that information and then you \ncan't justify having a cluster that \ncosts like multiple thousands of dollars \na month then you need a cheaper way and \nand in that case you're also probably \nvery happy to to trade off performance \nbecause well you don't have that many \nconcurrent queries and that is I think \nthese cases are going to be enabled \nbecause you can easily just say like \nokay here 50 60 70 cost reduction and \nthat's only the first step right like \nwith um if we get the the go for for the \nfull blown disc based solution then the \nreduction will be even further but \nalready \num I think we we can enable these these \nkind of cases where vv8 maybe right now \nwould be sort of a nice solution but \njust isn't viable and then it becomes \nmore viable for for these \nyeah that's super exciting uh super cool \nso if we're pivoting topics a bit uh we \nhave two more uh like kind of update \nthings then coming back into a speed \nImprovement another algorithm to talk \nabout um could you explain the cursor \nAPI and what that adds to aviate yeah so \nwe have I think in in this release and \nthe other one we haven't talked about \nyet but in this release we had the two \nhighest or most requested feature \nrequests from our community and uh the \nsecond one that we're going to talk \nabout later um is now the the highest \nthe most upvoted one but before that was \nthe case this one the cursor API was the \nthe most upvoted one \num and the the cursor API is if you \nthink about it it's a super super simple \nconstruct but it's so uh useful so \nbefore the cursor API existed if a user \nused vv8 as their primary database \num then at some point they they might \nhave a requirement could be for for \nauditing purposes could be for something \ncompletely different but basically the \nrequirement is how do I go or the \nquestion that they would ask is how do I \nget all of that data out of vv8 again \nand then in the past we would say well \nthat's kind of like maybe it isn't \ndesigned to get your your data out maybe \nit is designed to to get your data in \nand then search your data and you can \nlike if you find the right search \nqueries you can find everything that's \nthat's in that uh database but there was \nbasically no no way to get it out and \nthen um people would try to use like the \npagination feature as a workaround but \nthe pagination is is built in a way \nwhere basically each each higher page \nbecomes more expensive than the last so \nyou could do that to a certain degree \nbut then typically after 10 000 elements \nyou would run into some sort of an error \nmessage where V8 would tell you um \nyou've reached your I think it's called \nquery maximum results and you could \nincrease that but there's also warning \nthat that comes with higher costs and \nthat you shouldn't necessarily do that \nand now if you want to get a million or \n10 million or 100 million objects out of \nbasically there there just was no way \nand then you could build a workaround \nwhere you would every 10 000 object you \nwould assign a a field to a unique value \nso you could set like a a page property \non your object like a fictional page and \nthen every 10 000 you increase the page \nand then you could set a filter give me \npage seven or something and then you \ncould get those 10 000 that would match \nthe the fictional page seven but that's \nof course super complex so all of that \nthrow it out of the window don't have to \ndo it anymore now we have the cursor API \nthe cursor API is a super super simple \nconstruct you basically start somewhere \nwith an ID and if you don't know where \nto start then you just start with \nnothing basically with an mtid and you \nsay give me a thousand objects from the \ndatabase and then from that list a \nthousand objects they are in a specific \nguaranteed order and the last one you \ncan take the last ID and then you can \njust take that ID for the next page so \nto speak to bb8 and say give me the \nresults after this ID and then you get \nthe next ten thousand and the cool thing \nis that this this query has a constant \ncost so it doesn't matter if you've \nalready retrieved 500 million objects \nand now you want the the I don't know \nhow how many if page basically to get \nthe number next object it always starts \na new sort of retrieval process at that \npoint that you specify and now you can \nin constant time basically get every \nobject out of your database which makes \nit we've added the backups feature which \nallows you to get every object out if \nyou want to get it back into Eva \nbasically but now you can also if you \nwant to pipe it into a different system \nlike you could you could use that to \nstream your data to something let's say \nyou would have a specific or let's say \nyou want to train a model Based on data \nthat's in bb8 then how would you get all \nthe data out of it you get well you can \ndo that now with the cursor API and you \ncould either do it in one go and \nbasically just export it and put it \nmaybe in a parquet file and use that or \nyou could yeah do it on the Fly and sort \nof go through the cursor and do \nsomething with it \nyeah that case of training the model is \nwhat inspired me to click on the thumbs \nup on the on the roadmap thing and uh \nyeah it's very interesting like getting \nthe data out like imagine like just for \nthe case of you maybe just want to have \nyour data somewhere else again just \nbecause it's your data and you want to \nhave it as secure as possible and as \neffective as many times in as many ways \nas you can think of I guess but um this \nkind of idea of getting the data out for \nthe machine learning models I think \nthat's so interesting I I also think you \ncould use we V8 to retrieve the next \nbatch of training data kind of similar \nto Mosaic ml released this streaming \ndata set thing and I think we could be \nused in a similar way to get batches of \ndata for training so so yeah all of that \nI think is extremely interesting um so \nif we also come in now uh pivoting \ntopics again um so adding the filters to \nhybrid search uh maybe first we could \nstart with just like what it is and then \nI'm very curious what the technical \nchallenges behind this were \nyeah so this this is the other one that \nwas most requested so in in 1.17 we um \nreleased \num or we had bm25 support before already \nbut I think it was considered \nexperimental and we removed that flag \nand then we said like here it's General \navailability in in 1.17 \num but it did not support setting \nfilters yet so it's exactly the the same \nkind of use case as you as we talked \nabout before on unfiltered Vector search \nso same we can use the same example of \nthe navy blue t-shirt or combine it with \nprice tags and everything \num and you couldn't do that on a bm25 \nsearch and in turn because a hybrid \nsearch is both a bm25 and a vector surge \nthat also meant you couldn't do it on a \nhybrid search so in one at 17 we have \nthis awesome new feature um of hybrid \nsearch which um we we see that it can \nimprove the results running it over over \na specific data set benchmarks to enable \nit you see that you can get a higher \nndct score and higher recall and \neverything which is super awesome \nbut now you're missing that kind of \nother functionality that Vivid already \nhas for for Vector search so it was only \na matter of time and um this was \naccelerated by I think our community of \nvoting that ticket like crazy and it it \nreally became the the most upvoted \nticket \num very very quickly and \num yeah that's that's in Viva right now \nso you can now nothing changes from a \nsearch or if you let me put it this way \nif you've used a filter in vb8 before \nyou already know how to use the new \nfeature like it's literally the same \nwear filter and the only thing that's \ndifferent now compared to 1.17 is that \nthat error message goes away that tells \nyou uh filtered search is not supported \nyet \num and then now you can you can do it uh \nfrom an implementation perspective \num \nfilter filtered bm25 search is actually \nnot that difficult because we already \nhave the inverted index which we use for \nfor Vector search which by the way also \nmeans that that these features that \nhappen in parallel like if you set a \nfilter that's uh that's using the bitmap \nindex that we talked about before then \nall of a sudden these will also now be \nmuch much faster so there the good thing \nis that these two parts are a bit \ndecoupled so that wasn't necessarily A a \nbig change to get them working into vv8 \nhowever we've also completely Rewritten \nthe way that we do bm25 scoring because \nin 1.17 the initial release was a um \nsort of a let's call it a primitive \napproach where we'd literally score \nevery term that was matched um but now \nwe've introduced the wand algorithm \nwhich is um yeah another way to to \nimprove the retrieval a bit and then \nthat tied in nicely with the filters \nbecause we just did that that all in \nonce \nsuper cool and um yeah awesome so yeah \nthat's very interesting how the like I \nwas very curious like how the allow list \nkind of concept generalized to the bm25 \nscoring with the inverted index and the \nother connection to the bitmap indexing \nthat's also interesting um so yeah so \nmaybe stepping now into the wand \nalgorithm um I I had to give Dimitri \nKhan credit for he's the first one who \nkind of taught me about this kind of \nidea where he's like oh you could \nprobably have some way of uh sorting the \nterms so when in bm25 you have a query \nlike how to catch an Alaskan pollock I \nlike this car and you like um you know \nyou start scoring how to catch with the \nmatching and you can probably you know \nhave some efficient way of scoring the \ndocuments like these have matched so \nmany words so far that it's like highly \nunlikely that the match would be high \nenough so I don't know if that's the \nexact algorithm behind Wanda could you \nexplain like uh what what the idea is \nwith one scoring yeah yeah that's \nexactly the idea so you have in a bm25 \nindex or in a in a let's say in a in \nfull text search and this is something \nthat traditional search engines have \nbeen been uh or have provided for for \nquite some time already now you can also \nget that in in viviate in full text \nsearch you have specific keywords so so \nin very simple terms TF IDF or bm25 \nbasically rewards terms that are rare So \nin the how to catch Alaskan pollock uh \nthe the \num how to is probably super super common \nand doesn't really add any any value uh \nto the the um the search query but \nAlaskan already sort of narrows it down \nquite a bit so ideally in your search \nand so so maybe to to step one step back \nscoring everything that's in that term \nhas a certain cost right so if we \nbecause we use the inverted index that \nmeans the inverted index will tell us \nevery single document that contains a \nspecific term so for for Alaskan that's \nvery few documents compared to overall \nunless your entire database is about \nAlaska and I guess you know that that \nwouldn't um be true anymore but but then \nyou you'd have another query in that \nterm that would be or if your entire \ndatabase is about phishing then yeah \nsame thing so so basically there's \nalways going to be frequent and rare \nand ideally you want to give more weight \nso to speak but I'm not talking about \nweight in the sense of of um changing \nthe calculation because the calculation \nlike the score is going to be the same \nbut more weight in the sense of I want \nto tackle this first because it adds \nmore more value and then maybe I can \nskip something else so that's why it's \nalso called Dynamic pruning algorithms \nbecause you you want to prune the stuff \nbasically that that you don't need so if \nin a classical inverted list or inverted \nindex a kind of scenario the the \ndatabase doesn't know upfront which \nterms which right like it doesn't have a \nsort of semantic understanding and it \ndoes with hybrid search because of the \nwhole Vector search part \num but the the full text part doesn't \num so so now you have these like how \nwhich matches so many documents then you \nhave Alaska I'm just going to narrow the \nquery down for for example say it's just \ngoing to be how Alaska now doesn't make \nsense anymore of it makes it easier to \nexplain \num that then um yeah basically you have \nthese mini matches for for \num for how in these few matches for \nAlaska and you know how much each term \ncan potentially contribute to it based \non uh the the bm25 scoring so basically \nthere's a maximum and this is from this \ntfidf calculation it's also part of bm25 \nthere's a maximum contribution that each \nterm uh can make so now if you've let's \nsay you've not had one but you've \nalready started scoring 20 documents \nmaybe \num and your your top K so basically the \nuser defined limit is let's say it's 20. \nso you already have 20. that means you \nnow have 20 scores already so now you \nknow basically that let's say the bm25 \nscore of the the worst of those 20 \nobjects that you have is 17 made up \nnumber now you know that if an object if \na new object cannot reach score 17 you \ncan discard it and how would you find \nout if a new object can can reach 17 is \nbasically you look look at the maximum \ncontribution of each term so let's say \nthe word how and this this gets nicer if \nyou have a longer example let's just say \nI'm going to stick with this how we'll \nask him let's say the term how has a \nmaximum contribution of three and the \nterm Alaskan has a maximum contribution \nof I don't know 15. then if those two \nare combined that's 18 that's good but \nif they're not combined if you only have \nhow you can no longer reach your \nthreshold so basically what that tells \nyou and this is everything the one \nalgorithm does it tells you skip every \nobject for how that doesn't also match \nAlaskan and and this means that if you \nhave the these like sort of relatively \ndense list which is the one with how \nwhich is dense because there's so many \nmatches and then you have the sparse \nlist for Alaskan which is rare at some \npoint those lists are going to overlap \nand basically it allows you to to sort \nof move that pointer ahead to the next \npoint where they're overlap where you \nhave the the minimum possible score to \nreach and then \num same same goes on basically let's say \nyou managed to skip 5 000 matches for \nhow because only then you would find the \nnext ID that matches both how in Alaska \nand then after that there's another 5000 \nwhich only match how can do the same \nthing again in this way you can reduce \nthe amount of scoring drastically like \nin the most extreme case you could \nreduce it to the number of scores for \nthe word Alaskan and almost sort of \nignore the word how but of course if the \nif if the difference is not that extreme \nthen you still you don't want to \ncompletely ignore it you just want to \nsort of yeah not score it if you know \nthat it's mathematically impossible to \nreach a higher score and then you want \nto want to skip it and and that is what \nmakes that algorithm super cool because \nin the context of vector search we deal \nwith approximate algorithms a lot but \nthis is not an approximate one this is \nreally a just a smarter way of scoring \nbasically in the the score in the end is \ngoing to be exactly the same \nyeah that is so interesting to hear \nabout this sparse scoring algorithm and \nmaybe uh talk a little more about as far \nas vectors but just quickly like I've \nplugged in this wand test into the beer \ntest with natural questions and for me \nevaluating natural questions is 2.6 \nmillion documents and this time is how \nlong it takes to evaluate the ndcg of \n3500 queries and the difference before \nand after wand is like five and a half \nhours to like 14 minutes and this lets \nyou yeah I missed so I was like wow this \nis pretty exciting just anytime you see \nthat kind of thing it's similar back to \nwhen you had the Thousand speed up with \nfilters \nyeah those things are always like the \nEureka thing to see but yeah I think it \nis very it's so interesting like um I \ndid a little research into one and I saw \nthe paper from 2003 that uh proposed \nthis and I think it's so interesting to \nsee it uh still being used and I also \nsaw this other idea of splade sparse \nvectors or used deep learning models to \nuh to create sparse vectors so the idea \nbeing uh you have how to catch an \nAlaskan pollock and you put the language \nmodeling head on each of the tokens and \nthen you get a distribution over the \nvocabulary that comes out of the \nlanguage model so I think Pollock would \nprobably be the best one because maybe \nlike in addition to Pollock the language \nmodel might have thought it was like \nsalmon that would make some sense right \nso it would um so you'd have this sparse \ndistribution and it would be the same \nkind of scoring building blocks as far \nas I understand for uh how you would \nindex those that particular kind of \nsparse vector \nand then you know retrieve it \nefficiently but yeah the whole thing \nhearing about the thresholding algorithm \nit's all so fascinating um so super cool \nso yeah I think uh coming out of the \nsome of the speed things and now \nsomething that is into the database \nthing uh so what's new about replication \nyeah yeah so I think today \num like uh depending on on who the \naudience is either you have to wait a \nvery long time to to uh to get to the \nparts that are interested in or they're \nthey're going to learn something \ncompletely new because we we have so \nmany like this is such a diverse kind of \nrelease like we have we provide value in \nso many different areas like the the \nbitmap indexing I guess was sort of also \nmore on the database side but maybe \neasier easier to to grasp and uh yeah \nthe the \num PQ is sort of completely in the in \nthe nitty-gritty uh um Vector indexing \nthing kind of side but yeah coming back \nto sort of the the good old uh \ndistributed system kind of \num uh um yeah replication topic so we \nreleased replication in 1.17 and and \nsomething that we made very clear in the \nbeginning is basically this is the \nfeature set of what replication can do \nand this is if you if this is sort of \ngood enough for you then use it this is \nwhat we're going to do in the next \ncouple of releases and if you have a \ncertain point where you say okay I need \nthis particular feature then you can you \ncan sort of start using it that specific \npoint it's just going to get better and \nbetter over again so sort of the the \nidea is to release this in in chunks or \nin increments \num where it constantly gets better and \nyou don't have to sort of wait over and \nover again because \n1.17 probably covered 80 of cases but \nthen you have those remaining uh 20 \nbasically that take take much longer but \nalso that there may be a requirement for \nit for some cases depending on what you \nwant to do with with replication \nreplication to me is is such a an \ninteresting one because \nthe the motivation of why someone needs \nreplication in their database can go \nanywhere from they have a specific \nfailure scenario that they need to \nprotect and where they need to make sure \nthat if a happens the database doesn't \ngo down and then a database can still \nread or can still write into these kind \nof things all the way to they need to \nsign off some sort of a corporate sheet \nwhere there there's some sort of a \ncompliance policy that they cannot use a \nsystem that has a single point of \nfailure so everything needs to be \nreplicated and we're really seeing we're \nseeing all of those we're seeing like \npeople who who need replication for the \nactual value of replication we're seeing \npeople who just need replication so they \ncan take some sort of box and say like \nokay vvn has has replication \num and yeah depending on on \num where you sit on that that line I \nthink different different points and \ndifferent features add more more value \num that said that was all these sort of \nthe long introduction of how we release \nreplication in in smaller chunks but \nwhat's new in replication in this \nrelease is we now now have tunable \nconsistency for every single input or I \nthink almost all endpoints and and this \nis um so tunable consistencies is \nmodeled after Cassandra which in our \nopinion like basically we looked at okay \nwhat's out there in the space and what \nbehaves in the kind of way that we want \nVBA to behave and then Cassandra with \nits hyper scale kind of capabilities \nwith a very good good role model for for \nthis basically so tunable consistency is \nsomething that's modeled after Cassandra \nwhere basically you as the user can make \nthat kind of trade-off how consistent \ndoes this read or write have to be and \nthe the most extreme case would be all \nwhere you say like you have your \ndatabase replicated three times and then \nyou make a a write with consistency \nlevel all that means that request is \nonly going to be successful if every \nsingle one of those three nodes \nacknowledge your your right and if one \ndoesn't then the request fails but then \nyou could also have the Other Extreme \nwhich would be consistency level one \nwhere the idea is that only a single \nnode has to acknowledge right that \ndoesn't mean that only that node owns \nthe data like the data is still going to \nbe replicated to the other nodes but \nlet's say node 2 failed and now it can \nonly be replicated to node well let's \nsay you're hitting Node 1 and it can be \nreplicated to Note 3 that and node 2 is \ncurrently down this would still be \nallowed with with a consistency level of \none so basically in this case your your \nrequest would still succeed and that can \nbe desirable because this gives you a \nkind of scenario where you can still \nwrite even if a note is down and why \nwould a node be down well could be \nbecause it actually like Hardware \nfailure or something is broken but it \ncould also be something that's that's \nplanned where it's down for a very short \ntime for example because you're doing a \nrolling update so you could say like I \nwant to upgrade vb8 from 1.17 to 1.18 \num then each node would be in this this \nrolling restart kind of fashion would be \ndown for a very short time and if in \nthat short time period something happens \nnow you have a full control do you win \nstrong consistency then you you you \nprobably right with consistency all \nwhich means this request will fail and \nyou have to retry once it's back up \nagain or you could do it with one where \nbasically it will be replicated later or \nyou could do it with a quorum which were \nthe idea behind a quorum is basically \nthat that it's it's a fancy term for a \nmajority basically so a majority of the \nnotes has to be present and then if you \nuse the majority both during writing and \nreading then you always have to \nguarantee that that it has to match \nbecause if a majority of the nodes have \nreceived an update and have confirmed \nreceiving an update then when you read \nwith the majority there's mathematically \nno way to get the the old stale data so \nthese are the kind of um trade-offs that \nyou can do and and really configure this \nthis for your for your needs and then \nthere's the the second new part which is \nread repairs which to me is like the \nfirst time I used it I was blown away by \nhow simple it is and how effective it is \nso if we're sticking with this kind of \nsituation where a specific node was down \nduring an update and you accepted it \nbecause you said okay my the consistency \nlevel is say just Quorum or maybe even \none then how do you deal with it when \nthe node gets back like because at some \npoint that that node is going to be out \nof date right and if then you you read \nwith just consistency level one and \nthere's very good motivation to read \nwith just one because that means your \nthroughput can go up like if you if \nbasically every data is always \nreplicated and you read with just one \nthen now you have not one node that can \nserve all the data but now we have three \nnodes and you could also add a fourth \nand a fifth and so on so there's there's \nvery good motivation to read with with \nconsistency level one but now what \nhappens if that node is is out of date \nlike is it if you happen to hit the note \nthat didn't receive the update you would \nbe serving stale data and you can \nprevent this by setting a a higher \nconsistency level of course but also \nthis is where the eventual consistency \nof of \num a VBA basically you know that that \nwhole design comes in if you don't want \nto read immediately with the high \nconsistency level because it has a \nhigher cost and lower throughput you can \nrely on the fact that eventually this \nwill be consistent and one way to repair \nthe data and this is new in 1.18 is the \nread repair in the read repair basically \nsays if you query the object with a \num let's say with a quorum consistency \nlevel and VV it realizes that let's say \nthree nodes and two are queried and one \nof them is out of date viviate will just \nrepair it and VV it knows exactly based \non on timestamps and based on other kind \nof metrics of what happened DV8 knows \nwho of those two nodes is basically is \nwrong who who missed the update and then \nif you query it with that read repair \nby the time that your query is returned \nthe data is already repaired so you \nwon't even notice like you can query \nexactly the note that had the stale data \nbut as part of the query and that's why \nit's called a read repair basically as \npart of reading the data VB had already \nrepaired it in the background you you'll \nreceive the right request and that was \nthe moment when I tried this out for the \nfirst time like I tried to to \nspecifically get my my database in an \ninconsistent state by actively killing a \nnode then making an update making sure \nthat the node missed it we started it \num try to query it and and forgot to to \nset the the one consistency and then \ndefault it I think to to either Quorum \nor all and immediately it was already \nrepaired by the Moon that I I got the \nresponse and I was like wow this is \nexactly how it should be like this is \nthis is so cool because \num yeah if you really want to fine tune \nyou've got all the ways but also if you \njust want your data not to be out of \nsync then let's just read it just just \nlet it repair itself yeah it's amazing \nand I really liked how when we first \nstarted talking about um replication you \nhad like the um the Black Friday \ne-commerce example and understanding \nthese kind of uh trade-offs with read \nwrite and when you need certain levels \nof consistency yeah that read repair \nthing is so interesting I think this \nwould be also a great transition of \nyou've recently given this amazing \nlecture on our journey to build a vector \ndatabase and go and this is published on \nYouTube if people are interested in \nchecking this out um so a question I \nhave with uh replication these kind of \nthings is um you can touch on what \nfeatures of the golang programming \nlanguage help build things like this \nlike distributed database systems \nyeah \num that's nice because my my uh talk was \nbasically about what what features of go \num are hindering us from building the \nbest possible database no that's not \ntrue because it also it also has \nsolution for all of those challenges \num features in in go that really work \nwell is I think the main two things that \nthat um come to my mind right now is one \nis dealing with concurrency because \nespecially if you have these kind of \nkind of background operations you may \nhave to spawn like in in go you don't \nspawn a new threat but you spawn a go \nroutine a go routine is basically like a \nlightweight threat but then you can have \nbecause it's so lightweight you can have \nway more than than actual physical \nHardware threats and then the go runtime \nwill just manage it for you and it gives \nyou lots of tools to basically make sure \nbecause the moment that you have \nconcurrent processes there's always a \nrisk of data races and the whole tool \nset and go both during development as \nwell as for for how the language is \nstructured really makes it easy to write \nthreat safe or or sort of safely \nconcurrent code \num so that's that's one of the parts \nthat that um really really helped while \nthere \num the second is the strong standard \nLibrary so this is something that \ndepending on on so I way back before I I \nstarted writing go \num I used node.js because that was sort \nof the thing at the time and and I also \ndid some front end work and then some \npoint moved into back-end work and then \nit was yeah it was node.js and in \nnode.js you have the exact same opposite \nthe exact opposite sorry um so so \nbasically \nanything that you do you have to import \na package there was this I think it was \ncalled the left pad Fiasco at some point \nwhere \num a day a package that would pad a \nstring on the left side which is like \none line in any language even in \nJavaScript that's just one line that was \nan external package and then this \nparticular package had a security \nvulnerable or I think it wasn't a \nsecurity vulnerability in this case I \nthink it was just deleted I think it was \njust the author decided to delete this \nthis package uh but the problem was that \nthousands upon thousands of packages or \nor a node uh programs and packages that \nwere used everywhere in production \ndependent on that one package and all of \na sudden all the bills started failing \num so coming from node like way way back \nin the day like I was an early adopter \nof go so that I don't even remember when \nthat when that was but it was really \nlike like way back coming from node to \ngo seeing how strong the standard \nlibrary and go is and not needing these \nkind of third-party dependencies and and \nthese these kind of third-party packages \nthat was such a such a both an \neye-opener that you can do it just with \nthe standard library but also such an \nenabler because there's all of a sudden \nyou don't have to learn framework after \nframework after framework anymore you \njust know that the the standard library \nof go and it is it is somewhat sort of \nlimited but over time you you yeah \nyou'll feel like you know all of it \nthat's probably not true it's probably \nway bigger than what people typically \nuse but um it gives you a nice yeah sort \nof the the com commonly use things you \njust know how to use them and don't have \nto look stuff up and just by either by \njust typing it or relying maybe on your \nyour code editor IDE to do some \nautocompleting you can build basically \nan entire database and that's that's not \neven a fictional example because that's \nbasically what we we do in in V8 and to \nto loop back in the beginning when we \ntalked about bitmaps we said that we \ntook that crazy decision to um to build \neverything from scratch and not have \nmany external dependencies and that \nworks super super well with go because I \nthink that's also the philosophy and go \nthat the language is so powerful on its \nown that you don't need these \nthird-party tools but just with the \nlanguage provides is there and very \npractical example in replication because \nwe're we're dealing with the distributed \nsystems where nodes have to talk to each \nother there's so much Network traffic \ngoing on and then there's multiple ways \nof how to do that um but basically being \nable to do all of that just with tools \nthat the standard Library provides is is \nsuper powerful and really he keeps the \niteration time down so those would be my \nmy two favorite points about go um for a \nfeature such as replication \nyeah that's that's so interesting it's \nso interesting like going into the \ngolang and yeah I mean the whole end to \nend as we start off by talking about the \nbitmap the P hsw like vector search deep \nlearning and then coming into the \nfeatures of golang It's amazing And \num maybe one other detail on your talk \nthat I was curious about is um see as \nyou mentioned you you're talking about \nthe hindrances of going in them and one \nthing was the um the stack versus the \nHeat memory escaping to the Heap and and \nI know we talked about the garbage \ncollector uh maybe talk a little more \nabout like the state of I know the go \nmem limit and all these kind of things \nand like uh how that's been because I \nunderstand that it's getting better and \nyeah yeah let me try to answer that from \nthe perspective of a vv8 user amazing \nbecause I think the vb8 user has two \ninterests well or basically in in V8 but \nin turn then also in in go uh one is the \napplication shouldn't just randomly run \nout of memory like that's that's \nbasically the worst case you you sized \neverything correctly you plan for \neverything and then all of a sudden vbh \njust goes bam out of memory kill and the \nother is you want high performance and \nand these these things are closely \nrelated because \num performance in go often is a topic of \nof memory management which may not be \nsuper obvious because if you think of \nperformance you think like the \nbottleneck is your CPU right like if \nyour CPU does this many things per cycle \nuh then it's it's fast and if you can \nreduce the amount of things that it has \nto do per cycle or I don't know use a \nsmarter way of doing it like in the talk \nI talked about simd for example where \nyou could do eight operations for the \ncost of same operation that is what you \nimmediately think about but in a garbage \ncollected language like go often it's \nit's not even it's not CPU but or it is \ntechnically still CPU bound but because \nof something that you do with memory and \nthat is where where memory allocations \ncome in and um the idea between or the \nsplit between the stack and the Heap the \nstack is basically represents your \nfunction Stacks so as you move through \nfunctions you move through that stack \nand you have variables with a very very \nshort life cycle they they are as you \nstart calling the function basically the \nvariables are created or are avoiding \nthe word allocated right now but they're \nthey're assigned basically and then when \nthe function is over those variables can \njust go away so they have a very fixed \nlifetime whereas the Heap is everything \nand that's why go uses the term escaping \nwhich I kind of kind of like because it \nescapes that clear function stack and \nnow and this could be for example \nbecause it's shared between different \nfunction calls or because the lifestyle \ncycle is meant to be longer than these \nindividual functions called so basically \nsomething escapes and this escaping \nmakes it way more costly so both the \nprocess of escaping because now the the \ngo runtime Master like okay this is this \nneeds to be tracked basically and this \nneeds to we need to find some space \nsomewhere on the Heap \num but also then it needs to be \ndeallocated again because it's it's it's \nlike now now that it's escape the \nfunction stack it's no longer in this \nkind of predictable life cycle of when \ncan we free it and if you couldn't or if \nyou would ever lose that kind of \nAssociation of how it could be free then \nyou'd essentially have a memory leak \nyou'd have memory that's assigned \nsomewhere that you don't need anymore \nthat's still around and and then your \nyour memory starts ballooning and you \ndon't know why and that's that's \num yeah there are some things you \ndefinitely want to avoid and then to \navoid this basically go use the garbage \ncollector it's a very good garbage \ncollector but nevertheless something \nthat's allocated on the Heap is always \nslower than something that's that's \nallocated on the stack so this is the \nthe kind of perform performance a \nbackground \nin this kind of setting but then I also \nsaid you don't want your application to \njust randomly run out of memory and this \nwas the the biggest change in go 1.19 \nI'm almost getting confused with the \nversions of like bb8s at 1.18 right now \ngoes ago is actually at 1.20 right now \nat some point we have to start releasing \na releasing V8 faster than goes so we \ncan hire her numbers which I think that \nthe bb-8 release Cycles are way faster \nso that's only a matter of time \num but yeah in go 1.19 uh the go runtime \nintroduced this go mem limit thing that \nwe have a blog post about \num also and go mem limit does something \nthat's that's actually is one of those \nthings that are super simple in in \nhindsight or once you know and it's \nsuper simple go mem limit just says this \nis the limit of memory that you have \navailable in the garbage collector will \ntry to respect that limit and now the \nquestion is like Why didn't it before \nthat like why wouldn't the garbage \ncollector do that before and before the \ngarbage collector had um a tuning \nparameter that was relative to the \ncurrent Heap so basically in the default \nwas a hundred percent which would mean \nthat if you have a machine with 64 \ngigabyte of memories and you currently \nhave 33 gigabytes of memory allocated \nthe next hundred percent increase would \nbe to 66 gigabytes bam out of memory so \nso now you're at like 51 usage and just \nbecause of the way that the garbage \ncollector would try to allocate or try \nto um \nThe Collector doesn't allocate memory \nbut it would just delay running again so \nbasically now would say like okay I'm \ngonna run again once the memory is at 66 \ngigabytes but your machine only has 64. \nso that that doesn't work and all that \ngo mem limit does is basically give the \ngarbage collector that kind of hint of \nwhere the the limit is and go call this \na soft limit because it's really it's \njust a hint to tune the garbage \ncollector \num to to run faster \nand now the garbage collector basically \nknows okay I'm at 33 gigabyte my limit \nis 64. so I'm not going to wait till 66 \nbut maybe I'm going to run at 60 already \nand all of a sudden like you you made \nuse of that memory that that memory \nis there to yeah to serve whatever \npurpose you want whether it's a \npurposeful Heap allocation so for \nexample in bb-8 uh the vectors or with \nagents wpq also the compressed vectors \nthey stay on the Heap because that's \nwhat we want right we want them to stay \naround \num but something that we do for example \na filter that's used as part of a part \nof a single call stack that doesn't \nstick around so we don't want that that \non the heat but either way no matter \nwhether it's intended Heap or unintended \nHeap now with go mem limit vv8 can can \nor or any Go app basically can respect \nthat and make sure that it doesn't \nquote unquote accidentally run out of \nmemory again because that's really what \nit was like it it was it just set the \nwrong target basically \nand that's that's prevented with that \nand I think at some point we also added \na a feature into vb8 specifically that \nmarks your objects as read-only if if \nthat if you get close to that threshold \nso I think it's it's getting more and \nmore like as vv8 improves and as as go \nimproves it's getting more and more \ndifficult to actively manage to run out \nof memory which is awesome for a user \nbecause that essentially means it's it's \nmore stable and and harder to kill and \nif you still manage to kill it then you \nhave replication and then all is good \nbecause that that one note death doesn't \nmatter because it's replicated so \nyeah it's so amazing it's so amazing \nlike the depths of the languages that \nbuild databases the features of \ndatabases and then the whole search \ntechnology more broadly and uh so \nawesome Eddie and thank you so much for \nanother weeviate release podcast it's \nvery inspiring for me working on Wi-Fi \nto hear the depths of your knowledge \nwith all these things and I'm sure it \ninspires people who are using levator \nalready or are interested in checking \nout alleviate and I think we've 1.18 is \npacked with so many awesome features \nwith this bitmap indexing to have these \nfilters just as these like thousand \ntimes faster is obviously like just so \nincredible the wand the way that speeds \nup bm25 and sparse search I've seen that \nmyself it's incredible and hswpq all \nthese things replication and that's just \nso exciting so Eddie thank you so much \nthank you for for having me and also big \nthank you of course to the entire team \nthat that actually built this I am just \nhere basically summarizing everything \nthat that we've done as a team in this \nthis print but of course we have these \nindividual experts on on all of these \ntopics and and then that that allows us \nas you just said to have a a release \nwith so many different topics that \nprovide value in this is this is really \ncool and I'm super happy \num with our team and super proud of our \nteam so thank you everyone both both \ninside bb8 but also of course outside or \nCommunity for for all the input and for \ntelling us \num what the kind of features you need \nwhat kind of features you benefit the \nmost from and and yeah any kind of \nfeedback like use vv8 and tell us \nwhether you like it also tell us if you \ndon't like it so we can improve it but \nplease also tell that tell us if you do \nlike it because that's that's awesome to \nhear \num so it's so motivating both for for me \nand I think everyone on the team to hear \nthe success stories with bb-8 and this \nkind of there was a tweet the other day \nwhere uh sort of Father and Son uh \npairing did some experiment with with V8 \nand just reading that and reading the \nactual stories this is so cool to to \nyeah change people's lives one at a time \nwith reviate \nyeah that was an awesome tweet be yeah \nthe whole the moment of like the \nfather-son hacking with Ouija amazing \nawesome thanks everyone for watching \nthank you \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate 1.18 Release Podcast - Weaviate Podcast #40!",
