{"text": "SeMI Technologies Co-Founder and CTO Etienne Dilocker returns to the Weaviate podcast to describe what's new with Weaviate ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nchecking out the we va podcast we have a \nsuper exciting episode eddie and \ndilocker is back on the we vva podcast \nand we're going to be announcing what's \nnew about wev8 version 1.14 \nin this podcast format so hopefully this \nkind of style of having this \nconversation around the new changes is a \nnice companion to you know announces of \nnew software and things like that and \ni'm really excited about kind of uh \nrolling out we vva version 1.14 in this \nkind of style so eddie and if you had \nsay one sentence to explain the what's \nnew about wev8 what would it be \nyeah hey connors thanks for for having \nme i would say this is the most boring \nrelease that we've had so far and i'm \nsuper excited about that so what i mean \nit's it's all about uh reliability about \nrunning vb and in production so all that \nfeedback we've recently passed a million \ndownloads and all that feedback that we \ngot from our users running it either in \ntheir evaluation setup or in production \nuh they discovered a lot of issues and \nand we fixed them all and basically this \nis all in this release so i'm i'm super \nexcited about it \nso we have so we have the uh bullet \npoints of the different topics that are \ngoing to be covered in the chapters of \nthe podcast as well for people listening \nif you want to jump ahead to the \ndifferent parts of the release that \nyou're the most interested in but eddie \ncan we start with um what's new about \nmonitoring and observability what what \ndoes that entail yeah yeah so \nobservability i think in in any new \nsoftware project it's like always one of \nthese things where you know like you \nneed to design software in a way that \nit's observable because well if it's not \nobservable you don't know what's going \non and then it makes it super hard to to \nrun it like in a production setup where \nuh yeah you can't monitor it as as \nclosely and uh with vv8 i think for the \nlongest time we've kind of said yeah \nit's coming it's coming it's coming and \nit's finally here so with this release \nuh we're adding uh prometheus compatible \nmonitoring so prometheus is a sort of a \nvery standard i would say industry \nstandard for for monitoring tools um \nessentially it's just a format it's just \na format of how the metrics are are \npresented but it comes with that whole \nprometheus ecosystem so you can \nbasically just plug in standard software \nlike your standard prometheus a time \nseries database standard grafana for \nvisualizing those metrics and all of a \nsudden you have like insights into eva \nthat you could never have before so you \ncan get all these these dashboards and \nand really for everything so it's i \nthink over the past couple of weeks we \nhad like a rough plan of what metrics we \nwould need but we just we kept on adding \nmore and more metrics because it's just \nso easy to add new metrics now so a very \ntypical example case would be importing \ninto vba so let's say you're importing a \nrelatively large say i don't know 100 \nmillion plus \nand all of a sudden it starts getting \nslow so that was definitely one of the \nand also when we talk about the \nreliability fixes later on that was one \nof the of the topics that could appear \nin the in the um \nin the past so a community user would \nmaybe say maybe say it's suddenly slow \nand then we would go oh well that's not \nsupposed to be like that but it's kind \nof hard to tell what's going on because \nwell \nnot only is it not us running that \ninstance like maybe it's self-hostable \nso so users can run it themselves um but \nalso they how would they know basically \nand with the monitoring setup this is \nnow super easy because every request \nthat comes in so for example a batch \nimport that is split into its individual \ncomponents so it's being imported in the \nvector index and the object storage \nmaybe the inverted index if you if \nyou're building that up as well and and \nthen all of these components are split \nup further but that gives us a super \neasy insight to just say oh look we can \nsee that the vector index is fast but \nthe object index is maybe uh slowing \ndown so ever since you crossed i don't \nknow 100 million objects because you can \nof course also overlay that so you could \nsend okay at that point you had 50 \nmillion objects imported and all of a \nsudden there was a jump maybe in the \ntime to to import one additional object \nand uh that gives us and then our users \nand then everyone operating vb8 a lot of \nconfidence and a lot of insight in into \njust \nfiguring out what the issue is and \nfixing it so it could easily say like oh \nlooks like you have an issue with your \ndisk maybe or um something else in the \nsetup like yeah before it was a lot of \nguesswork and now it's it's i guess \ndebugging is still it's still detective \nwork but now the detective has like \ntools and has hints to \nto basically uh yeah \nfigure out what's going on \nyes i'd really love to dive more into \nthe incremental build up of the h s w \ngraph and get back into the technical \ndetails of that topic but uh just just \nso just one more time so prometheus it's \num it's like a visual dashboard kind of \nlike uh like a graph where you say have \nuh you know you have this much ram has \nbeen used uh this many vectors are \nwhat kind of what does the visual of it \nlook like yeah yeah so basically uh vva \nitself just comes with those metrics and \nwe can like everything that's going on \nwe can basically measure and prometheus \nis kind of the format but prometheus is \nvery typically used in combination with \ngrafana which is this dashboard provider \nwhere you can you can so users can \ndefine their own dashboards they can say \nokay i want to combine this metric or \nmaybe \nsee like how a metric changed over time \nand these kind of things \num and of course we also have like we \nhave a couple of sample dashboards so if \nyou want you can have like this one \nclick setup where you say um hey so we \nhave in our vba examples repository we \nhave this the setup you just spin it up \nand it has everything pre-configured and \njust you start using vva normally but \nnow you can open up that grafana \ndashboard and you can just see what's \ngoing on so so yeah it's a very very \nvisual way you can of course also use \nthose metrics programmatically if you \nwant but like with grafana it's super \neasy to just visualize it for yeah for \nthe users for the people having to \noperate it for for everyone that's \ninvolved in sort of making their case \nwith vb8 as a success case \nyeah it sounds super exciting especially \nfor like you know very big scale i \nimagine that it's very useful to have uh \nso does this relate to say the \nhorizontal scalability idea we talked \nabout earlier where uh you're using more \nthan one machine with wev8 and does this \nhelp you kind of monitor that as well \ndid those kind of play together a little \nbit yeah yeah yeah exactly so so \nprometheus is really i would say sort of \na cloud native tool um so it does stuff \nlike orchestrating across nodes it does \nthat very well so you can like you can \naggregate basically you have two ways \nlike you could say uh is there something \ngoing wrong on maybe one specific node \nand then prometheus just adds a label to \nit for for each node has a name or has a \nhostname or these kind of things so it \ngives you a label to to narrow it down \nor you could just say well i want to \ntreat this vvate setup that's composed \nof multiple nodes as one unit basically \nfor for my use case and just tell it to \nto aggregate those those metrics as one \nand you can do it as well so that's \nthat's basically this granularity \nwould be \nyou start with the setup like like you \ncould let's say you would have a \nmulti-tenant setup of like multiple vba \ninstances and that would be like the \nhighest one where you would say maybe uh \nas a as a vba user uh you yourself have \nlike different users and then each user \nhas like its own vba instance for \nexample then that would be the first \nfirst level of granularity then per user \nyou would have this one vb8 setup there \nyou video setup itself might have \nmultiple nodes on each node you would \nhave maybe multiple vb8 classes they \ncould be compromised of individual \nshards so basically you can you can go \ndown as deep as you want until you have \nlike individual objects or even even \neven deeper on disk or you could go like \nvery highs and this gives you um sort of \nthe the ability and prometheus does that \nvery well to to just aggregate those \nindividual labels um yeah across \nwhatever you want including including \ndistributed notes in a cluster setup \nyeah super exciting stuff and i \ndefinitely want to talk also about uh \nmultiple classes and uh you know to \nquickly kind of background this for \nlisteners we have this kind of \nsemantic relation data schema design \nwhere you could say uh have one class \nwould be say tweets and then you could \nsay like has article link and then maybe \nyou want to store like an article as \nanother class like has image has another \nimage so it's a way to do multimodal \ndata it's a way to say decompose your \ndata if you have a scientific paper and \nyou say want to have a has introduction \nhas related works has methodology you \ncan break it up into multiple classes \nand then you could have h sw structures \nfor each of the classes if i'm \nunderstanding that correctly but uh so \ncould we kind of uh come back into the \nincremental build up of h sw and i think \nit ties into the monitoring as well just \nto maybe get a little more into what's \nhappening so so with h w my current \nunderstanding of it again is we have \nthis proximity graph \nand um \nso you can take me through how you \ncompute the proximity graph and then \nand then how you incrementally build up \nthe neighborhood graph to facilitate \nnearest neighbor search at massive scale \nyeah yeah yeah i'm gonna gonna try to \nkeep this as short as possible so we \ndon't exploit the entire podcast because \nyou know i love talking about this um \nbut but no in in general uh the idea of \nthe the proximity graph is that a \nnearest neighbor in the graph basically \nis the nearest neighbor in the terms of \nnearest neighbor search so that the \ndistance and that that may also be a \ngood segue to one of the other topics \nand when you talk about distances later \non um the distance between two neighbors \nin the graph is lower than the distance \nbetween \na neighbor where you'd need two hops \nthrough the graph \num and that that is the same like if you \nimport two objects or maybe three \nobjects or five objects or if you go to \nhundreds of millions like there is a \npoint where if you want to you can chart \nthis up into like multiple instances or \ninto multiple uh yeah indexes basically \nif you say \num \nfor example \nwith this very large machine i can hold \n500 million on a single machine but the \nmachine is simply not big enough to hold \nmore than 500 million but i need three \nbillion for example then you could say \nokay i'm going to split this up into six \nmachines that each hold 500 million and \nthen each of those machine would have \ntheir own hmsw graph but from a user's \nperspective you wouldn't really notice \nbecause the the results basically if you \ndo a search it would search all six \ngraphs in parallel and then because we \nall have this distance metric it's \nbasically in a sense it's re-ranking i \nguess kind of a fancy term but yeah it \nbasically just means we take those \nresults from those six graphs and and \nbasically uh aggregate them yeah and \nwith the with the monitoring you can you \ncan watch uh the graph grow basically so \nyou can see live like how how many \nobjects are imported and um it also has \na couple of so so the the graph itself \num basically it grows exponentially so \nyou need to reserve memory and and this \nkind of growing operation is a bit \ncostly in the sense that while it's \ngrowing nothing else can be going on so \nit's like for for the highly concurrent \nsetup you need synchronization and just \ni'm just throwing in buzzwords now so \nbasically you need to need to lock this \ngraph \nand this is something that that um yeah \nyou could you could see before um or or \nthat we couldn't see before because we \ndidn't have the monitoring that the way \nthat we grew this graph um that that \nwasn't necessarily optimal uh because it \ncost too much time and and now with the \nmonitoring we could say like okay yeah \nthis is like this or growth interval of \nthe graph is too low in comparison to um \nto how far we've already made it and \nthis this was to the the point um so \nthis is one of the the the reliability \nfixes that we have in this release to \nthe point where um we did a load test \nourselves and i think beyond \n50 million it it just it was very \nnoticeable that it slowed down like \nthere was no problem isn't you couldn't \nimport more than 50 million objects in \nvva but going from zero to 50 million \nwas super fast and going from 50 million \nto 100 million was all of a sudden \nreally slow and the culprit was actually \nthe the way that we grew the the h w \nindex which was super super easy to \nvisualize like in our monitoring this is \nnow just like or it was like a graph \nthat was just like steps basically how \nthe the index would grow and then you \ncould easily see that just sort of the \namount of data that we imported compared \nto the the growth cycles just didn't \nmake sense so all we had to do is like \nchange this from a linear to an \nexponential \ngrowth uh setup and and now um yeah the \ngrowth operations are relatively rare \nbecause i think it grows by like 25 \num so if you already have 100 million \nobjects imported the next growth \noperation would go to 125 and then um \nyeah you wouldn't wouldn't have to grow \nit again for the next 25 million imports \nand that was the entire reason for for \nwhy imports slow down so it's something \nsomething as significant as well vv8 \nslows down after 50 million you know \njust simple change in the growth and \nthis is something that in this case we \nas the engineers could tell basically \nfrom the monitoring but all kinds of \nthese these things i think like whenever \nyou have a problem with v8 in the future \njust look at the metrics and just see \nlike what's what's going on and \ntypically if you have a bit of a feeling \nfor a bit of experience with vba it will \nbe very easy to just pinpoint okay yeah \nthis is this is the reason \nyeah i love that and i love that the the \nnumbers behind it when you start \nthinking like uh you know 50 million 100 \nmillion you start putting some numbers \nbehind how many vectors can i load and i \nthink um \nmaybe come back to our a n benchmarks i \nlove how that puts some numbers to you \nknow you have a million vectors you want \nto search through it the vectors have \nthis dimensionality this is how long it \ntakes i think having these numbers out \nthere really helps just understand \nwhat's happening and \nso i think with the wikipedia example \nit's like uh 280 million uh paragraphs \nor something like that \njust kind of thinking about some some \nthings we can do like putting all of \nwikipedia into wv8 and \nyeah yeah i think it's a bit bit smaller \nthan that at the paragraph level i think \nat the sentence level it would probably \nbe in the in the hundreds of million i \nthink it's in the tens of millions but \ni'm not entirely sure um but yeah but \nbut just yeah this this kind of scale \nlike it's it's it really is big data in \na sense i mean that's just i'm really \njust throwing in buzzwords today \nlike what is big data but yeah that is \nlike \nmillions tens of millions hundreds of \nmillion billions and we're we're talking \nabout like at the billing scale we're \ntalking about okay what are the kind of \noptimizations that we can make to to uh \nsort of make that \nless resource intense in the future but \nwe're never talking about like can i \nachieve it at all because yeah it's it's \nthere you can do it right now \nyeah amazing so it's the idea of like \nsay putting all of archive into eva and \ni love the big data and kind of what \nthat unlocks and uh and yeah i'm sure \nthere's a lot of uh so i think kind of \ngoing from this topic now i think that \nwas a \ngood coverage of monitoring \nobservability understanding and maybe \nquickly to clarify it so the h and sw \ngraph you build up as you scale up \nhorizontally you'll split the proximity \ngraph and you'll have separate proximity \ngraphs for each node and so kind of \ncoming back into the approximate nearest \nneighbor search it's kind of like that \nstochastic algorithm where you have \nthat kind of approximation so is that a \ncorrect understanding quickly before \nmoving on yeah yeah yeah absolutely and \nit's it's really the important thing \nhere is you can configure it in whatever \nway you want it \nthere is a disadvantage of splitting out \nmainly because you're you're spending \nbasically your resources twice if you \nhave to look to traverse two graphs in \nparallel um \nso there is probably a point where it \ndoesn't make sense and you don't have to \ndo it but it's it's full control to the \nuser so it's really you can sort of \nbuild up in the same sense that that \nhmsw itself also has hyper parameters \nwhere you could and i think our \nbenchmarks page really visualizes that \nnicely where you could use different \nbuild parameters to to sort of get a \ndifferent \ndifferent uh yeah performance metrics \nout of the the graph and i think uh \nsharding it into smaller segments is \njust one more of those sort of build \nparameters in a sense \nis so is this approximation is this \ncaptured in the a n benchmarks does does \nthe a n benchmarks have the scale where \nyou where you do this kind of thing \nuh it's currently all a single single \nchart in there so that's that's not \ncaptured yet but that's a that's a good \npoint like we could \nwe could add a sort of a very large \nscale benchmark and and that's \ndefinitely something that we have on our \nroadmap anyway um and we could we could \nyeah sort of capture that as well like \nwhat how does it change if you build it \non let's say a single very large machine \nas opposed to like three or four large \nmachines or something like that so yeah \ngood idea \nyeah really exciting and maybe just one \nmore thing on the a n benchmark some i'm \nmaybe just like um a little bit of i'm a \nlittle curious how you have the \nbenchmarking script and the server \nscript and then the hdf5 files where you \nhave the \nuh ground truth and how people can uh \nyou know contribute their own data sets \nto a n benchmarks uh you tell me take me \nthrough the setup of that like if i have \nmy wikipedia vectors right and i want to \nadd it to and benchmarks with wv-8 how \ndo i do that \nyeah yeah uh the the format that you \nmentioned hdf5 and this is \ni think hdf5 in itself is basically just \nlike a container format where you can \nlike um yeah put data \nvery similar to like a folder structure \non on disk just like in a single file \nand uh the reason we chose this is uh \nbecause of a n benchmarks on the great \nwork that uh eric benhertzen has been \ndoing there already \nand just all the data sets that are \npresent there are in this format so this \nis basically the reason why we chose \nthat format um so all you would have to \ndo to run or to contribute your own \nbenchmark is put that data set in that \nsame format and then for the for the \ncontents basically um yeah you need to \nhave the the vectors obviously so all \nthe all the the vectors you want \nimported and uh what's great about those \nexisting data sets is that they have so \nsimilar as you would have like a train \nand test split when training a model \nthey also have like this this sort of \npredefined these predefined queries uh \njust to make sure that everyone that's \nrunning that independently is really \nasking or is really comparing the same \nthing so it will always be the exact \nsame queries and i think it's typically \nin those data sets it's something like a \n10 000 queries as part of the set so \nlet's say the set has like 10 million or \n1 million or 10 million or something \nlike that object and then you create the \nsame 10 000 uh \nvectors \nand because it's the same the same \nvectors that you query all the time that \nalso means that you expect the same \nresults and this is what the ground \ntruth is so the crown truth is basically \njust using a non-approximate nearest \nneighbor well not algorithms not really \nan algorithm anymore but basically just \nbrute force search \nacross the data set um which is which is \nslow but it's basically only done once \nfor for each query and then for each \nquery we know the exact nearest \nneighbors which are the ground truths \nand then all we have to do is basically \ncompare this and this is this is \nthe what the the benchmark script then \ndoes so we have a very simple script \nthat basically it spins up vba with \nspecific configuration you can of course \nyou can tune that \nit's very simple actually i think the \nthe only sort of non-standard \nconfiguration in there is we've slightly \ntweaked the the garbage collector to to \nbe a bit \nmore aggressive in reserving memory \nbecause we've sized the machine \nrelatively largely so so we don't \nbasically don't get interrupted by \ngarbage collection cycles um but that's \nan optimization that everyone can do so \nthere's no no sort of secret magic but \nthat i think's the the only thing um \nyeah and then the benchmark script \nbasically just takes that hdf5 files \nextracts the individual vectors and just \nimports them and and after importing it \nqueries them and for querying it uses \nthe the query vectors \nand \ncompares the results that vba will give \nyou to those crown truths \nand then basically the overlap is the \nrecall so if um \nout of those \n100 results \nonly 98 are part of the crown truth list \nthat basically means you're missing two \nso you'd have 98 recall \nyeah i think this is also exciting you \nknow how what's the recall looking like \nuh how fast is it how many vectors can i \nload into ev8 having this monitoring \nobservability seeing it get uploaded so \nyou're not just like looking at it \nloading and you see \nyeah all of this is really bringing it \ntogether not \nputting some numbers behind it i was so \nexcited so so in our podcast of our \nrelease we're now going to kind of pivot \ninto a \ndifferent topic now so uh so let's talk \nabout vector distance functions cosine \ndistance l2 distance dot product what's \nnew with that yeah uh yeah so in uh if \nyou've seen the the benchmarks there's \nactually i think some data sets are \nangular distance which is cosine \ndistance \nand then one is using uh l2 or euclidean \ndistance and that is something that's \nactually new so this was kind of a \nsilent release before the version that \nwas released with the benchmarks already \nsupported that but it wasn't officially \nsupported yet so you'd not not find \nanything in our documentation about it \nand the reason for this was we we had to \nsort of we we had to figure out how to \ndo this in the apis correctly because in \nthe past um there was like one sort of \nsingle number that always controlled all \nthe distances and that's the certainty \nso whenever you get a result back uh you \ncould display the certainty and the \ncertainty was always guaranteed to be a \nnumber between zero and one zero would \nessentially mean like it's there's \nthere's absolutely no match so it's like \nin in uh in an angular space you could \nsay it's the opposite vector so if one \nvector points in one direction that \nwould be the vector pointing in the \nexact opposite direction um in not not \nall spaces basically oh yeah that that \nthat's a good point of sort of why we we \nneed something else \nso basically you have this bounded score \nbetween zero and one which works \nperfectly for for cosine distance \nbecause cosine distance yeah it's an \nangular distance and an angular angle \ncan only have like \n360 degrees basically so \nit's a limited range in a sense \nbut now if we're looking at a euclidean \ndistance for example um if two points \nlike two points can be infinitely far \naway from one another so this this uh \ndistance basically there's clearly a \nminimal distance that they can have \nwhich is zero if they're identical uh \nbut there's no maximum distance because \nyou could always basically have \ncoordinates that are higher than other \ncoordinates so the distance would \nincrease so what we're noticing is that \nthat general idea of saying you have a \ndistance score between zero and one that \nkind of breaks with other distances and \nand uh euclidean distance is just one \nexample you could also have \nhave a dot product for example where \nit's then the opposite way like dot \nproduct uh um basically the the closer \nthey are the higher the dot product but \nit's also not entirely correct but a bit \nof an oversimplification but uh here \nbasically you have a higher number if \nthey're if they're more similar so \ngenerally what we're noticing is that \nthis idea of just putting it in a number \nbetween zero and one that's nice that's \nthat's easy to understand but it's not \nvery flexible with different distance \nmetrics so what we're doing right now in \nin the 1.14 release is we're introducing \nan actual field that's called distance \nand what you get back in that field is \njust the raw distance so so if you're \nusing a different distance metric and \nthis is this is the really the new \nfeature that you can use different \ndistance metrics um if you're using \ncosine nothing changes everything is the \nsame you can still use certainty um but \nif you use a distance metric that simply \nisn't bounded in that that's a small \nrange \nthen uh you can just use the raw score \nand you can interpret in whatever way \nyou want if you you could for example \ncome up in your application with a way \nto normalize that into a specific range \nthat's all fine but basically we as bb-8 \ndon't want to say like yeah we're doing \nsome elaborate calculation here uh where \nthen users asking like okay i'm using \ndot product why is this number like why \ndoesn't that match the raw dot product \nthat i could uh calculate outside of vba \nso general idea is just \nless magic just sort of pass the actual \nvalues through and users can interpret \nit in in any way possible and that was \nthe major reason of why uh we didn't um \nrelease the distances uh uh previously \nyet because yeah we said okay we need to \nwe need to figure out how to do this \nproperly in the apis for like a a proper \nuser experience for for custom uh \ndistance metrics \nthat's yeah that's the the first part of \nit \nuh then there's \nthere's something else that that i \npersonally and this is the the engineer \nin me speaking and that i find super \ninteresting about distances \nis \nthe most cpu time that we spend in vba \nis typically on calculating distances so \neven with these these uh a n indexes \nsuch as h and sw \nit's basically just a smart way to \ncompute fewer distances but in the end \nhow many distances you can compute and \nhow efficiently you can compute those \ndistances really determines the the \nperformance and throughput of the whole \nthe whole vector search engine \nand um there \nwe have center specific and this is \nsomething that we're also releasing now \nwith the new documentation for 1.14 \nthere's a clear overview of what kind of \noptimizations are in place for for vv8 \nso to \nvery quickly dive into how this works \nfrom from a coding perspective vva is \nwritten in golang and that is \nunfortunately a bit limited with these \nlike really low level um \nlow level optimization so in c plus plus \nfor example you get this this \nvector intrinsics api that you can use \nto to do like parallel computations on a \nsingle cpu cycle golang doesn't have \nthat so we had to be a bit creative and \nhad to write that in assembly um which \nalways yeah this is this is the moment \nlike where the audience typically goes \nyeah so we had to to do this in assembly \nwhich i think it's it's cool that we \nhave it um but at the same time um this \nthese kind of assembly optimizations \nthat you do you always do them for like \none case so you would say that this is \nfor example for dot product on amd 64 \ncpu architecture \nfor uh \nlet's say \ni don't know cpus that support the avx2 \ninstruction set which is typically intel \ncpus for example so um long story short \nwe have that like completely transparent \non the documentation and my hope is that \nmaybe someone out there in the community \nwho really likes dealing with this like \nreally low level stuff is like hey look \nat that combination like for example \nthere's missing an optimization for \nmaking this up a or m64 i know how to \nuse that instruction said i'm going to \ncontribute something so that would be my \nmy dream \nto get a couple of open source \ncontributors to really help us uh figure \nout like what the the yeah what distance \nmetrics can still are not distance \nmetrics but distance computation \nfunctions where they can still be \nimproved and uh yeah make it a a an even \nfaster experience for everyone out there \nyeah wow the that part of the arm is \ninstruction that's over my head i'm glad \nto be on your team where you know \ni have someone who knows that kind of \nthing because i don't think i would ever \nfigure that out but that is so \ninteresting how you can go low level to \noptimize the distance calculations and \nyou know speed these kinds of things up \ni find that whole thing to be so \nfascinating and \nmaybe we could return a little bit to \nthe first part about \nthe user experience and kind of usually \nwhen i think of user interfaces i think \nof you know these visuals and you know \ncss and that kind of thing but these \nlittle these little design decisions \nlike uh certainty or distance and kind \nof what that relays to you like you know \ni like using the when you have the near \ntech search you get the certainty \nunder the under uh \nunderscore additional certainty that \nthat shows you the distance and it's \nreally useful for say earlier we \nmentioned re-ranking if you want to see \nthe distances from your query the \ndocuments and maybe have some extra \nprocessing based on that and yeah having \nthat um distance just the just kind of \nhow it uh helps people understand it \nbecause maybe i was curious about the \noriginal design of certainty because um \ndo you think about uh vector distances \nin that kind of probabilistic sense like \nwhere you have this kind of \nuh certainty of saying i'm i'm this \ncertain that this vector is similar to \nthis vector kind of in the same way \nbecause i think when you have like a the \nquestion answering example \nthe certainty is very like uh clear you \nhave a good sense of what that means but \nwith vector distance um how do you think \nabout that kind of like use of certainty \nor distance just just a little naming \nand what that tells people about what \nit's doing yeah yeah yeah and i think \nthat that was exactly the the original \nidea of of not going with a raw distance \nbecause way back sort of before vv8 \nversion 1.0 uh before we before \neverything was modular and before um \nyeah the whole uh sentence transformers \nwere a thing um \nwhat you would typically uh or what you \nwould do with vva then was \nyou would only use it with the \ncontextionary so basically we were in \ncontrol of that whole sort of uh \nmodel uh uh uh space \num and there was there was just one \nthing and then our general idea was like \nokay like \nif if all of this is abstracted away the \nuser does not need a distance they just \nneed \nsomething to indicate them yeah like \nokay the model is somewhat certain that \nthese things are close matches whereas \nin other cases the model isn't as \ncertain obviously we've come a very long \nway since then you can still use the \ncontextionary as a sort of simple \nuh \nyeah simple model with vba but also \nthere's there's this whole \nresearch out there new models sort of \npopping up every day and you can use any \none of them and that makes it a bit more \ndifficult to to claim that something is \nmore or less certain than something else \nbecause every model will do that \ndifferently so you have sometimes you \nhave models where like everything is in \nthe 0.99 to 1 uncertainty range and then \nyou have another model where like a \nperfect almost identical result has like \na certainty of 70 percent so that kind \nof highlights that that yeah as we we've \nopened up vba and we're making more \nflexible and where we're enabling all \nthose cool data science teams that have \ntheir own models um yeah it's really \nit's very hard to to make this one claim \nof like yeah this is how certain uh \nsomething is um \nbut of course you can use you can still \nuse certainty in the future on on \nanything that uses cosine distance um \nbut yeah you'll also just get the raw \ndistance to \nsort of have an un \nun uh opinionated way of basically just \nhaving an objective number and you can \nstill sort of put something on top of it \nof saying like yeah distance larger than \nx means certainty y \nyeah super cool \nand yeah the the i love the graphql \ninterface for how you access these \nthings too just kind of maybe come back \ninto the whole design of thing but so so \nback to our release podcast and pivoting \ntopics so um so this now the next \nchapter is about uh reliability and bug \nfixes and i'm so i'm so interested to \nhear also about how the uh the community \nplays into this i i'm so impressed by \nyou know your ability mars and stefan \nand everyone's ability to answer these \nquestions that come up on slack i see \nthese questions come up in the slack \nchat and i'm like well that would be \nlike a day for me to try to figure out \nbut it seems like you know you all can \njust answer the question quickly and so \ni'm really curious to hear how that \nwhole ecosystem plays with developing \nthese things \nyeah it's it's i think it's it's first \nof all thank you very much this is super \ngreat to hear because i also think like \nour community is our strongest asset in \nthat sense because um yeah we've now \ncrossed a million downloads which is a \nlot of users and um \nwe've \nsort of i think uh vva 1.0 has been out \nfor like one and a half years so \nthere's there's just a lot of usage out \nthere \nand that gives sort of that gives users \nthe guarantee that what they're using is \nsomething that's that's sort of that \nthat's battle tested and at the same \ntime every single user using vva is \nessentially a qa engineer for us because \nthey're really their stress testing is \nand like no one is as creative as as our \ncommunity in in trying to find ways to \nbreak vba and that is awesome that is \nexactly that is exactly what we what we \nwant and what we need um so that that's \nalso how uh sort of how we can be so \nenthusiastic about barb reports because \nlike \ni think so someone's asked me at some \npoint like ah aren't you would you like \nthree new bug reports this week aren't \nyou sad or something or aren't you \nunhappy i was like no this is awesome \nlike the bug was already there now it's \nvisible and and if if a brand new piece \nof software that that is sort of doing \nsomething so revolutionary if that's not \ngetting bug reports then i'm convinced \nthat she's not getting enough usage \nbecause like um \ni i don't think vb8 is any better or \nworse than our competitors with regard \nto preventing or not having bucks but if \nit's being used then bugs are being \ndiscovered and then they can be be fixed \nand um yeah huge shout out to to our \nteam that's \ndoing like \nspending so much time reproducing that \ntogether with our community users and \nreally identifying all these these sort \nof from smaller issues to to larger \nissues so for me \nthat the worst i think there was a \nperiod in in bb8 history that luckily \nthat's that's gone now but there was a \nperiod uh where you could get vba to \ncrash in a specific way that it wouldn't \nbe able to recover and that was that is \nfor me that's the worst because \nwhat do you do like yeah that's the one \nthing that you don't want to happen in \nyour database is that it just stops \nbeing stops being visible and you \nbasically have to throw your data away \nand start to start from scratch it's \nfine if you're evaluating it but that's \nnot fine if you're running in production \nand that is luckily that has been fixed \nfor for a couple of versions so i'm i'm \nnot aware of any more reports of people \ngetting into this kind of situation \nwhich is super super important but there \nwas one uh um sort of that i would still \nconsider a very critical buck that we've \nnow fixed with the the um \nwhat not 14 version um this box so uh \nmartin's always joked that this buck \nlike it has many names because it was \nlike it was very simple bug but it \nresulted in yeah you could say like in \nin what was perceived as data loss like \nyou would you would query your data but \nyou wouldn't get a proper result or \nsometimes there was like a a mismatch in \nin the way that how you queried it like \nyou could retrieve that object uh if you \nused a filter that matched its id but \nyou couldn't retrieve the object by its \nid and this is like this is this is the \nworst for a database this is really it \nreally shows like yeah you've managed to \nsomehow uh \ncorrupt your index and by saying you \nthat doesn't mean that the plane was on \nthe user not at all like they they \ncouldn't do anything about it that was \njust a bucking media and as with all of \nthese bugs this bug was it was \nessentially like a one or two line fix \nthat was just really like one edge case \nthat was somehow uh missed and uh i want \nto plan like a a twitter threat about \nwhat is exactly going on with that bug i \nthink that's a bit too detailed for the \nfor the podcast um but yeah it it just \nmakes me super happy that we can we have \nusers finding these things then we get \nthe help from the community to to \nreproduce it and then it's sort of this \nthis nice interaction back and forth of \nour engineers and our users to to really \nidentify these these um \nthese bugs and and then really fix them \nand and of course also add the testing \ninfrastructure to make sure that we \nnever regress on those of those kind of \nbugs like if it's if a bug is discovered \nand fixed once like we we never want \nthis bug to to to reappear and we're \nadding the tests and we're adding like \nnew and creative ways of internally we \ncall them like stress pipelines or chaos \npipelines where really we're just trying \nto to basically trying to simulate users \nthat uh make heavy use of vva like for \nexample they're importing a lot they're \nquerying while importing and then the \nserver crashes every minute or something \nand then like the the goal of the \npipeline is first of all it needs to \ncome back up uh but also when it comes \nback up it needs to like that the data \ncan't be corrupt like everything every \nwrite that was acknowledged to the user \nneeds to be \nare actually written to to the database \nand these kind of things um so these \nthese pipeline help us tremendously to \nto really guarantee \nsort of yeah this this battle-testedness \nof bb-8 \nby sort of automating what we're getting \nfrom the community and every release is \nis better than the last and uh i really \nthink that that 1.14 \nas like if if i had to point at one \npoint in our timeline would say like \nokay \nfor whatever reason i was waiting with \ngoing to production with vv8 when should \ni go then like this this is the point \nright now this is um \nwhere we're getting all that feedback \nfrom \nfrom uh semis uh uh uh sort of uh \ncustomers so paying customers and users \nfrom the community uh from our own \nsetups that we're testing internally and \nand we fixed so i i don't know the exact \nnumber right now because we're recording \nthis slightly before the actual release \nis out so the number may still go up but \nwe're somewhere in the range of like 25 \nplus issues that are fixed in this \nparticular release and some of those are \nsuper critical like the one that i just \ntalked about for for the data loss some \nof them are just some small edge cases \nwhere maybe if you set a different uh \nspecific parameter in some sort of \nfilter you would get an error message \nand then okay you could fix it by just \nsetting something else so it's like a \nmix of very large and very small issues \num but yeah just all of them coming \ntogether and all of them being fixed \nright now that makes me so proud of our \nteam and so proud to to yeah sort of \nannounce vb8 1.14 \nyes so it's so interesting the flywheel \nof of community and open source software \nand \nlike pull requests issue raising and the \nway that it's all organized that whole \nthing i think is such an interesting \ntopic \nso um \nyeah \nso i guess is there so yeah 25 issues \nmentioned and i think it was a great \ndetailing of particular bugs and i \nimagine the monitoring and observability \nthat probably helps a lot right with um \nespecially with importing and querying \nwhile importing as you mentioned \nyeah hopefully content like the podcast \nalso and just kind of content generally \nhelps educate people and just \nmake the flywheel spin faster with the \nwhole the whole scope of the thing so um \nso i think that's a good coverage of um \nreliability and fixes and i think this \nnext topic in the update is kind of \nrelated is it with the um api changes \nand namespace update is yeah yeah yeah \nin a sense in a sense you could say that \nthis was also a bug but it was more of a \ndesign box so \num this is this ties very well into \nwhich you mentioned before with the \ndifferent classes so you gave the \nexample of like a tweet and maybe that \nhas a has a link to i don't know post or \nsomething so you would have two separate \nclasses \nand um the concept of having different \nclasses or different collection or \ndifferent namespaces and databases i \nthink that's that's as old as databases \nso if you if you spin up a mysql \ndatabase uh there i think they're called \nthey're called databases if you um spin \nup elasticsearch they're called index so \nso this this kind of concept of \nisolation \num is very yeah it's very useful like if \nyou want to do multi-tenancy or if you \njust want a separate like even if it's \nthe same tenant but if you just want a \nseparate data somehow it's it makes \nsense to to isolate stuff um \nand there was one problem in vva which \nis \ntechnically everything is isolated on \ndisk already so so these never as you \nsaid before also we built a different h \nand sw index for each class \nand not just the agents w index also the \nthe store around it everything was \nisolated on disk but then there was one \npoint in the api where actually that \nisolation was missing and um most \nnotably so this was basically for the \nthe um \nthe \nv1 objects and then id endpoint \nif you would create it wasn't really a \nproblem because in your payload when \ncreating an object you would specify a \nclass name so basically you would have \nthat isolation which is the class name \nbut now if you deleted something you \nwould just delete object id without \nspecifying the class name so if your id \nactually existed in multiple classes \nwhich should be fine because we're \nsaying these are separate collections so \nwe're saying like yeah that's that's \nfine like you can you can no need to to \nkeep ids globally unique because these \nare separate \nthen what should happen because this is \nthis is and this is what i'm saying like \nit's a design but because i think there \nis no good answer and way back we had a \nbug where i think bb-8 would delete the \nfirst object that it would find with \nthat id which is this i mean this is \nhorrible because like what does that \nmean like you you meant to delete one \nfrom one collection \nbut it would just delete the first one \nthat i found and then at some point we \nwe \nfixed this and then fixed is really in \nin quotes here because it was more like \na workaround or saying like okay \nthe delete function will actually delete \nevery object that has that id so it kind \nof gives you the guarantee that the \nobject with this id is deleted but it \nwas still a mess because like \nif that id really existed like in three \ndifferent classes and you wanted to \ndelete just one all of a sudden you \nwould delete like three objects which \nmeans two of them you might not even \nhave wanted to to delete so long story \nshort this is actually a very simple \nchange all we're doing is changing that \napi and by changing um there's no \nbreaking change so all the old apis are \nstill going to work you'll probably see \na couple of deprecation messages in the \nthe coins but everything is still \nstill working but we're simply changing \nthis api to include the class name and \nand that's that's basically it it took \nme 10 minutes to explain but now you \nhave that that isolation and now \nbasically all of these problems are are \ngone because anytime you reference an id \nyou also reference the class name with \nit and now we have that that completely \nseparate name spacing basically \nso could you tell me a little bit more \nso um so when you're saying isolation \ni'm thinking you mean isolation of the \ndifferent classes so tweets articles but \nthen there's also the vector index and \nthe object index \nright is there \nso what goes into the object index i \nknow we talk a lot about the vector \nindex but is there any particular \nstructure like maybe like i've heard of \nlike inverted file is that the correct \nthing to say yes \nyeah yeah so i think we can we can split \nit up even further and could basically \nsay there's three parts there's the \nvector index which yeah we've talked \nabout quite a bit um then there's the \nobject store which is basically just a \nkey value store so every object has an \nid and you can retrieve that object by \nits id you can delete it you can you can \nupdate it replace it these kind of \nthings \nand then we have the inverted index and \nthe inverted index is sort of it's very \nsimilar to the object store in the sense \nthat it's also an lsm store to throw in \njust yet another buzzword here so that's \nthat's the architecture behind it um it \ngoes too far to to explain what that is \nuh for now i think um so so they're very \nsimilar in the sense that they're both \nlsm stores but the purpose is quite \ndifferent so the inverted index \nbasically is there for uh for filtering \nso for for anything that's structured \nsearch basically so uh if you would have \na a property color and then it would be \nblue red green and you would set your \nfilter in your search color blue \nthen \nprobably should have used color pink as \nan example or color uh whatever the name \nof our vba green and blue is so well \ngreen blue is in there yeah just just \nred was the one should have been pink um \nso so if you set that uh filter to to \nsomething like color blue uh then the \ninverted index would be used to to \nnarrow the search down basically so in \nthe inverted index that's why it's \ncalled inverted you would have an entry \nnot per object but per value so that's \nthe the inversion basically so there \nwould be an entry for blue and then it \nwould point back to all the objects that \nare that are blue basically that have \ncolor blue set and um \nyeah and these are these are technically \nseparate instances on disk \nbut vba combines them in a very uh yeah \nin a very intuitive way so so you can \nset a filter and you can set a vector \nsearch and then basically the inverted \nindex would create what we call this \nallow list which is just sort of a list \nof objects that may be contained in that \nsearch and it would pass it on to the \nvector search and then a vector search \nis optimized to sort of work within uh \nthat allow list in this way you have \nlike combined filtering of uh your \ncombined vector search and filtering \nyeah really interesting \nthat kind of symbolic filtering on the \nvector search i think is a huge part of \nit definitely an interesting part um \nso i kind of wanted to ask so the lsm \nthing i don't want to get too into it \ncan i understand it as being like a \nbinary like a b tree kind of right some \nstructure like that where you um is that \ncorrect like where you \nit serves it serves the same purpose as \na b tree or as a b plus tree but it's \nactually a slightly different different \nstructure because b plus trees basically \nhave that and now now we're in a big \ndata area again so b plus trees have \nthat problem that the more you import \nthe slower it is to import something \nbecause basically the tree grows and \ngrows and grows lsm trees sort of turn \nthat or i think they probably shouldn't \nbe called trees \nbut i think that's the official name um \nbut lsm stores basically do it in a \nsense that whenever you import something \nyou always import into a fresh segment \nit's called a segment and then once a \nsegment basically is is flushed to disk \nso the segment is first held in memory \nbut no data can be lost because parallel \nto writing into the in memory segment \nyou also write into a right ahead lock \nbut once this memory segment is \nbasically flush to disk \nthen an async process sort of merges \nthat segment with existing segments so \num the the the write speed is pretty \nmuch constant like doesn't matter how \nmuch how how many objects you already \nhave it's constant and this is super \nimportant for these like hundred million \nplus scales because uh way back uh i \nthink in version before version 1.4 or \nsomething we actually used a third-party \nlibrary that was based on a b-plus tree \nand back then i think we were talking \nlike very different differences so cool \nto see where we've come like when we're \ntalking about the hundreds of millions \nand the billions and back then i think \nwe were i don't know i remember like a \nmillion was a barrier and like the b \nplus tree would really especially if we \nalso use the inverted index like a \nmillion plus was really the point where \nthe b plus tree sort of slowed down um \nand that's when we made the change to \nthe ls m tree and uh yeah now we're \ntalking about the hundreds of millions \nand billions \nso so can so so does it have a lot of \noverhead would it be would some users \nwant to turn that part of it off and \nhave no inverted file just the vector \nindex and that kind of thing \nthat's that's a viable option like if \nyou if you i don't think it has massive \noverhead um but maybe if you \nso essentially the overhead is the \nnumber of properties that you have \nbecause for each property \nlike one bucket and a bucket is the the \nunit within the the inverted index one \nbucket is basically created for each \nproperty so let's say you would have \ni don't know 100 properties on your \nobject but you're ever only querying two \nof them or ever only ever using two of \nthem in filters then there's absolutely \nno need to index those remaining 98 ones \nso you could absolutely turn them off \nyeah that's a that's a good point \nyou can in that sense you could turn off \nthe entire inverted index \nif you just ignored if you skip \nbasically every every property \nyou would lose the ability to filter but \nyeah that's a that's a viable case if \nyou know you don't use filters during \nyour search like don't need to spend the \nthe time on indexing it don't need to \nspend the disk based on indexing it yeah \nso it's absolutely absolutely viable \nthe object store itself you cannot turn \noff because like whenever you get a \nvector search like you don't just get an \nid background you get the whole object \nback so that that needs to be there \nbecause that's that's in my opinion that \nthat's one of the distinguishing factors \nbetween an actual database and like a \nsearch library you could like a search \nlibrary would tell you uh the the \nresults are id 17 id 19 and id22 and \nthen you would have to use like a \nseparate database to retrieve whatever \nthat id represents but because vba being \na sort of vector database uh you could \njust get the whole object back \namazing thank you so much eddie and i \nlove our podcast hacksaw it always \nreally increases my understanding of \nwebv8 and and the whole database thing \nreally and i you know i really enjoy \nthis and \nversion 1.14 to quickly recap changes in \nmonitoring and observability reliability \nand bug fixes support for non-cosine \ndistance l2 dot product and also some \napi namespace changes so \nlisteners i really hope you enjoy this \nkind of like podcast style of doing a \nnew release and it's something that \nwe're going to hope to keep doing and \nthat and i think it adds a nice kind of \nuh you know flair conversational flair \nto it and i hope that also kind of this \nlike uh \nyou know teacher student with eddie and \nteaching me these things and hopefully i \nask questions that you know you also are \nat that level if you're not quite on the \nexpert level and \nit clarifies these ideas so so thanks \nagain eddie \nthank you very much i definitely enjoyed \nit hope our listeners too \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Etienne Dilocker on Weaviate v1.14 Release! - Weaviate Podcast #19",
