{"text": "Weaviate Academy Unit 2: A Look Inside. \nhey and welcome backin this section let's dive deeper intoVector searches to see how wavy it helpsto make the magic happen behind thecurtainswe've covered a lot of ground in thisunit alreadywe've learned how to use get andaggregate functions to retrieve objectsor compile informationyou've seen different ways of PerformingVector searches like near Vector a newobject and near text and learn how touse filters such as wear limit andoffsetnow let's take a moment to explore thevector search process in a little bitmore detailyou might have noticed that even thoughall three of them near Vector new objectand near text are vector searchparameters you don't actually provide avector to aviate with near object ornear textbut regardless of whether you use nearVector near object or near text theactual search is always based on avectorthe difference with new object or neartext is that the input is converted to avector by waviatewhen using the near object parameterwaviate retrieves the associated Vectorfor the object which then becomes theinput vectoron the other hand when using the neartext parameter where the 8 converts theinput text to a vector based on theapplicable vectorizer moduledepending on your settings it might beusing an external API or a local modelwe'll cover more on vectorizers verysoon but for now just know that they arewhat we V8 uses to convert objects liketext or image to a vectoryou'll see in this section ademonstration of this by taking nearobject or near text searches andconverting them to equivalent nearVector searchesand we also talked about filteringbut when does the filtering exactlyhappendoes wavy feel to the data before thevector search or afterwe V8 implements pre-filteringwhat this means is that the specifiedfilters are applied first result in anallowed list of objectsthe vector search then Returns the mostrelevant objects from this allow listthis approach combined with efficientfiltering methods enables wevia toreturn the right number of results andfasteven when restrictive built is appliedto large databasesso a visualization of the vector searchprocess might look something like thisan input is provided containing filtersand Vector search parameterswith the filters wavier performs apre-filtering step to obtain an allowlist of objects on the other hand thevector search parameter is used todetermine an input Vector which mayinvolve an additional step such asretrieving the object's Vector with nearobject or vectorizing the input textwith near textthe input Vector is then used to performa vector search from the objects in theallow listreturning the most relevant objects oran aggregation to the usernow this is something of ansimplification but hopefully this givesyou a good mental model of how a vectorsearch works in leviate in terms of bothhow filtering Works in conjunction withthe vector search and how those Vectorsearch parameters workthat's it for this video thanks forwatching and we'll see you soon", "type": "Video", "name": "Queries - A Look Inside", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTCENuuK3FU", "timestamp": "", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
