{"text": "Hey everyone, thank you so much for watching the 54th Weaviate Podcast with Andrei Bondarev!! Andrei has contributed an ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching another episode of the wevia \npodcast I'm super excited to welcome \nAndre bondarev Andre is uh works at \nsource Labs a consulting firm and he's \nrecently built a ruby client for wegate \nand Lang chain so I think this will be \nsuch an interesting podcast diving into \nyou know the the nuances of uh AI \nsoftware Consulting with these new waves \nand deep learning tools like you know \nLang chain leviate and obviously like \nthe llm apis and all these things so \nAndre thank you so much for joining the \npodcast \nthank you hey super excited to chat with \nyou today awesome so could we kick \nthings off with uh Source labs and sort \nof what you're seeing in the kind of uh \nConsulting space with the new uh AI \ntools \nsure uh swear \num sorry we're on a small software \ndevelopment firm uh it's called Source \nslots uh so we build custom applications \nTechnology Solutions for uh small medium \nbut also large Enterprises so we work \nwith both uh \nuh venture-backed startups uh we worked \nwith Y combinator uh companies Tech \nStars uh accelerated companies but also \nwith uh all the way through Fortune 500 \ncompanies \nwow that's interesting um I haven't \nheard too much about like um this is \nkind of like a like a like a stat I've \nheard of like Staffing contracts where \npeople need to build some like say you \nneed to build a weba database so you \nwould you know a start up like a y \ncombinator startup would hire these \nfirms to like quickly build the new \ntechnology can you maybe walk me through \nmore about like what the business of \nthat looks like \nsure so we don't uh \nwe we do some staff augmentation where \ncompanies just want to pour more fuel \nbasically on the fire and kind of \naccelerate the development of their \ntechnology or \nuh the execution over technology roadmap \nbut we also love to do Greenfield \nprojects and and kind of come in and \nassess what the problem is what are the \noutcome what are kind of business \nobjectives you're trying to reach and \nand how to how to get how to get you \nthere \num and we've been uh this year we've \nbeen especially hyper focusing on AI uh \nML and llms of course yeah I'm super \nexcited to dive more in into the AI the \nnew kind of Stack that's the emerging \nbut quickly could you tell me like \num like maybe for you know entrepreneurs \nlistening to this podcast like how did \nyou get into this kind of space \nyeah so actually uh we just finished \nexecuting on a large uh project for a \nclient uh I'm not going to disclose who \nthe client is but it's a uh it's a \nwell-known public company \num and they have a set of tools \num that they built \num that provides the data analytics \nlayer on top of public policy both \nNational and global \num all around the world \num so public policy like laws rules \nregulations Etc \num and we just concluded in a massive \nproject where we rebuilt our whole kind \nof application and a large part of it \nwas rebuilding their search engine uh \nand so we built that in \num uh in the last six surge \num and we did both the the front end the \nback end work the setting up the data \npipeline \nconfiguring the indexes \nuh the apis ETC and \num as soon as we finished it uh late \nlast year \num I kind of uh came to a conclusion \nthat you know what we had built is \nessentially kind of outdated now \num and this was uh hap you know and \nas as the vector search database has \nkind of started uh \nbeing uh very popular in the market \num you know I figured that \num \nbuilding a purely a keyword search \nuh is uh as a as a core feature of your \nproduct is no longer very attractive I \nmean uh when you're building a search \nexperience now uh you need to make sure \nthat when a user interacting with your \nsystem your large data sets \num that the system also understands the \nintent the the meaning and what you call \nthe the semantic search uh and this kind \nof led me down the path to \nuh explore the the current capabilities \nthe current systems the vector search \ndatabases uh and I I discovered weeviate \nand prototyped a couple kind of pet \nprojects with weavate \nuh so I love hearing that background \nI've learned so much from like uh the \npeople at open source connections and \nthat that whole Community around and uh \nByron vorbeck has recently done a talk \non from keyword to Vector at Berlin \nbuzzwords and this kind of evolution of \nthe uh the way I understand it is that \nelasticsearch was quite a massive thing \nand you know a lot a lot of Consulting \ndeveloped around helping people \nImplement that and add key research and \nnow this this kind of the shift to \nVector search and yeah I've done all \nthat so interesting I love the The \nMention Of You know the semantic Surge \nand fuzzy meaning intent understanding \nall that kind of uh like abstract stuff \nbut yeah so quickly I think kind of \nstaying on this topic um with your \ntransition into Vector search what was \nkind of like your Eureka moment like \nwhat got you over there \num again uh some of the some of your \nproducts I've I've prototyped \num it it seemed like \num you know I didn't when I'm searching \nthrough a large data set as I mentioned \num I no longer have to search for exact \nkeywords uh exact keywords that are \nfound in in those data sets right I can \nI can search for synonyms and similar uh \nsemantic Concepts right similar Concepts \nthat are uh Concepts that are similar in \nmeaning \num and get to information that that I \nneed \nuh and I've really enjoyed I've really \nenjoyed we V8 uh so I've looked at a \ncouple different solutions I really \nenjoyed we need like I love the module \nsystem \num so I kind of I I like how it's uh \nit's an end-to-end solution \num \nand there's a lot less uh there's a lot \nless Plumbing that you have to do as \nopposed to as opposed to some of the \nsome of the other Solutions and \num and uh \nmy my uh tool of choice although I've \nplayed with a lot of different languages \nthroughout throughout the years \nthroughout my career my tool of choice \nuh has has always been Ruby uh I love \nthe language I love the ecosystem and \nand \num kind of my my journey into the vector \nsearch and the open source work uh \nuh was kicked off by by me just writing \nuh a uh we V8 uh API client in Ruby \nuh that's super cool really quickly \nbefore I obviously we're gonna dive into \nRuby and that's so interested in the \nclient um so it sounds like you know \nyou're exploring these new tools and I \nlove to mention the module system \nbecause I think it'll tie so nicely with \nthis as well as I want to then \nunderstand uh how you like came into \nLang chain and sort of your early \nthoughts on using that \nyeah so obviously \num it's not a I I think the space is so \num is so young right \num and people are prototyping and and uh \npeople are doing a lot of prototyping \nand exploring different approaches \num it's not exactly a plug and play just \nyet right so some of the things you need \nto think about when you're indexing your \ndata into a vector databases like the \ncontext window for example right and how \ndo you determine the perfect uh context \nsize how do you split up your data right \nA lot of times you can't just split on \nuh a certain \nuh character \nuh uh limit threshold uh because you you \nkind of lose the the semantic boundaries \nright so for example \nuh you know a lot of times like when \nyou're searching for an answer uh an \nanswer might be a combination of the \ndifferent different chunks uh different \nchunks of data so so there's that \nproblem it's very chunking \num and uh also there's a lot of kind of \nunderlying configuration uh that needs \nto be set up when you're configuring the \nthe vector search databases like the the \nuh the what what kind of embeddings \nyou're using uh what kind of uh what \nkind of formulas you're using whether \nit's cosine or dot product to kind of \ncalculate the uh the similarities \nyeah I think uh something like um well \nfirstly I think I'm curious about the \ntext chunking things and the solutions \nto that offered in Lang chain sort of I \nknow about like the recursive character \nsplitter that particularly I think it's \nyou know like \ndelimiters that are cooked in like if \nyou're splitting up python code or stuff \nlike that or markdown where it looks for \nthese particular symbols and and then \njust has the 512 tokens but uh is there \nmore and you know it for maybe a little \nmore context in the wevia podcast we've \nhad Brian Raymond from unstructured \nwho's presented this idea of you know \nusing these like visual document parsing \nmodels to maybe extract the structure of \nlike you know this this chunk of text is \nan image caption these kind of things \nlike like what are kind of the \nInnovations in text chunking that are \nthat you're seeing \nyeah so \nyou can actually so one approach I've \nseen uh and you know I think I think \nfolks are coming up with new approaches \nuh weekly uh one approach I've seen is \nwhere you would actually feed some data \nto an llm \nand and app and prompt it to suggest the \nchunks based on based on uh the meaning \nthat that body of text represents \num \nalso uh you know one approach that we're \nexploring within uh the project that uh \nwe're we're going to talk about shortly \nuh link chain RB is is actually \nsplitting up on uh on a custom function \nso for example passing passing a Lambda \npassing up function and then writing \nyour logic uh that would split the text \num \nwhen it's being parsed right so one \nexample I'll give you is for example uh \nif you're importing a legal document \nright and it has several different \nProvisions uh you know intellectual \nproperty non-compete in terms of service \nuh \nEtc \nso for example you can uh uh you \nprobably want to split that document by \nthose specific sections and it's not you \ncan't configure a set character chunk uh \nbut you could say that uh as the text is \nbeing parsed right if you encounter this \nstring which is uh an enumerated heading \nof that contract section then slice it \nright uh so that's another approach \nyeah I think we we get lucky with like \nweb pages where you'd have like that you \nknow like angular brackets slash UL or \nat the end of a list and then you know \nright don't split this list into two \nseparate chunks for embeddings but yeah \nas you mentioned just kind of detecting \nlike that kind of shift from free text \nlike if it's um yeah like laws and it \nstarts like the new the title of a new \nlaw and so you know and the chunk even \nif it was only 100 tokens then it's just \nnot just like a 500 token window and so \nyeah that's super interesting and I \nthink one more topic on Lang chain I \nthink actually it makes sense to kind of \ncover this before coming into the Ruby \nthe Ruby ecosystem particularly is so \nwith Lang chain you mentioned um you \nknow the configuration of the embedding \nmodels the configuration of the vector \ndatabases uh so so all right my \nunderstanding is you're seeing the value \nof a framework like Lang chain as it \nlets you you know rotate out those kind \nof things is it it's like the \nI don't know what a good word for that \nis but it's the orchestration behind \nOkay cohere has a new embedding model so \nswitched out with open AIS or you know \nalleviate you know want to tweak \nsomething here so you can easily tell me \nmore about how you see that \nyeah so I I think there's always uh \nthere's a lot of benefit about uh \nuh about using an opinionated framework \nright and actually again we're going to \nget to uh the Ruby World shortly uh a \nlarge uh part of Ruby development is uh \nRuby on Rails right so building uh web \napplications uh apis \nuh in a extremely opinionated framework \nright and that's and and that's and \nthat's uh that's why and how it uh it \ntook off and became so popular because \nyou didn't have to think about all these \nlow-level decisions right \num the whole approach was that hey we've \nyou know we think these this is the best \nway to build 95 of the uh web \napplications you know it covers 95 \nuh of use cases it fits 95 of the use \ncases \nuh and and this is the opinionated \nframework that uh I think would work \nreally well so \num so they so I'm drawing a parallel to \nbuilding llm uh based applications is \nthat I think uh developers uh can also \nbenefit from this opinionated approach \nyeah I think that's the um in our \npodcast on llm agents um uh Colin Harman \nwas describing this idea with like \nsymante Colonel and how it's a little \nbit more like decided on you know these \nare the these are the abstractions and \nand rather like whereas contrastively uh \nllm framework like Lang chain is a \nlittle more open-ended where it's a \nlittle more open source Community Driven \nless of um you know a rigid \nconsolidation of you know these are the \ntools to use it's more the discovering \nyeah I think that that whole thing is a \nreally interesting uh just thinking \nabout like what is a software framework \ngenerally as like kind of a market \ncategory what kind of thing does it \nstrive to do I found that learning about \nthat is all really interesting I'm super \ncool so I think it would be great to \ndive into Ruby and I'll try my best to \nkeep I know a little bit \num yeah so as as I've mentioned uh Ruby \nhas been uh a tool of choice \num \nof mine for a very long time I've tried \nuh lots of different languages uh and \nkept coming back to Ruby \num \na lot of people talk about developer \nhappiness \num uh and I will also mention that uh \nIt's always important to use the right \ntool for for the job and and I found \nthat uh the problems that I that I was \nsolving that uh Ruby was was was uh \ngreat at solving those problems \nand so \num \nRuby's still very popular \num there's still a lot of companies all \naround the world using Ruby uh they're \nbuilding they're supporting maintaining \nexisting products or starting and \nbuilding brand new applications in with \nRuby uh obviously Arabian rails is uh \nhuge within within the Ruby community \nso \num \nI \nthought that as as a ruby Community we \nought to have uh a solution for building \nllm based applications uh because \num as as this \num \nAI wave uh has been kind of rolling in \num I think product managers are coming \nto their engineering teams now and are \nasking hey we're aware of these \ncapabilities we'd like to add some of \nthese capabilities to our existing \nproducts \num here's a business case for it \nhow can we accomplish this right and \nthen as engineering leadership team \nleads Architects uh \nuh \nthey have to decide whether you uh add \npython right as kind of the most popular \nlanguage within that space in the mix \num and if you do that you need to you're \nspinning up additional containers \nadditional compute uh separate Services \nright you have to figure out whether you \nwant to support additional complexity \nadditional overhead \nand also whether you have capabilities \non staff to do that \num or uh if it's a ruby shop \num whether you'd like to uh use a \nsolution that your engineers would be \nfamiliar with right \num and I think there's also and this is \nthis is a uh uh a larger conversation I \nthink there's also \num kind of uh \nuh people are reflecting on and on all \nof these complicated uh microservices \narchitectures now \num uh this this path that uh we as uh \nthe software development Community have \nuh gone down \nuh people are looking at all that \ncomplexity and and are you know thinking \ntwice now before uh before doing that \num so I I see a lot of people kind of \nconsolidating \nuh their architectures into into a \nmonolith uh into a model of uh \napplication architecture because it's \nslot \num uh a lot of times it's a lot easier \nto manage \nso taking it apart a bit because I don't \nunderstand this too well so a \nmicroservice architecture is where you \nlike containerize every function and \nturn it into like an API and then it and \nthen the system interacts with it that \nway and then that way if something's in \nPython it's you know it's just a \ncontainer with an API so it's \nlike whatever compared to where a model \nis where the whole thing is in Ruby so \nyou put it in and it's all one \napplication right right right right uh \nanother way to to think about it is uh \nthe microservices architecture is when \ndifferent parts of your application \num are \nstrung together uh \nuh by Network boundary basically have \nNetwork boundaries right so from one \ncomponent of your application to talk to \nanother component of your application uh \nthere needs to be a network call right \nuh and you know it needs to be a request \nfor example Over The Wire \num whereas a monolith application is \nwhere different a monolith architecture \nis where different parts of your \napplication different components of it \nare are hosted within a single uh with \nwithin a single kind of memory unit \nso then you know where with my deep \nlearning hat on I'm thinking about like \nmodel inference serving and so are you \nable to I know like they \nso I I know a little bit about like \nbindings where you could you know like \nyou can have the inference in C plus \nplus and it can have python bindings to \nit can you so can you do that kind of \nthing to run inference of a deep \nlearning model within Ruby so that the \ninference lives in the same application \num \nso any any of those libraries where \npython wraps uh underlying uh C \nfunctions \nuh \nyou can theoretically rewrite those same \nlibraries in Ruby \num and and call into those same C \nlibraries \num \nyou know does it does it make sense to \ndo that uh you'd have to think really \ncarefully about that yeah it's so \ninteresting I mean I guess I'm just \nthinking about like um \nI guess like some some things with \nweeviate it's like I think about if we \ncould have like a model inference \ndirectly in the database compared to \ndoing networking requests like if we \nwould want to just like to throw out an \nexample like if we wanted to do this \nkind of like re-indexing idea where you \nhave a model and now you fine tune it \nand you have a new model and you want to \nupdate the vector space like if we could \ndo that inference directly and we get \nthat's what kind of motivates me asking \nthis question about like when you would \nbuild in model Arc model inference into \nsome kind of software architecture \ncompared to uh you know like API \nrequests across the wire and uh I guess \nit's like where my head's at with that \nkind of thinking but uh pivoting topics \na bit I'm really curious about \nlike clients in general like you know a \nruby client on top of a database how do \nyou think about like database clients \num well uh so for example in in uh if we \ntake if we take we V8 right \num so you guys currently have a uh an \narrest endpoint and HTTP arrest endpoint \num and a \num for schema management \num also indexing \num and largely the capabilities for \nquerying the database are uh there's a \ngraphql layer in front of it \num and I don't personally find graphql \nto be super convenient uh in in terms of \nconstructing queries \num I think Json just just feels a lot \nmore intuitive but also \num more in line with kind of the data \nstructures \num that are native to different \nprogramming languages \nso \nyou know actually and that's that that's \nexactly the reason why \num I uh initially wrote the the Wii V8 \nuh Ruby API client is to abstract away \nsome of those complexities like \ncommunicating with a graphql client \num \nso so because like I know with python \nit's like you get back the request then \nyou parse it where you're like you know \ndata get so like they're they're you you \ninstead of have having to unpack the the \nJson that comes back from the graphql \nyou already kind of parse it out and \nthen and and then you just create like a \nsyntactically nicer kind of interface to \nthe database is that generally the idea \nright right correct so I think the other \ntopic uh is you know I understand very \nlittle about this Eddie and explained it \nto me and I just kind of nodded along in \nthe podcast like this difference between \nuh like graphql rest API grpc apis like \nlike what is really the difference I I \njust kind of for me I just think about \nit as like what the input output looks \nlike yeah so it's it it's basically \ndifferent uh communication protocols \nuh so grpc there's a couple different \nFrameworks uh \nI'm personally most familiar with Apache \nThrift \num \nand \num it's it's \num \nit's quite flexible \num you can configure uh you can \nconfigure uh \nyour transport layer \nuh to send data in lots of different \nformats uh binary uh \nJson uh Etc \num I find I've found that it's a little \nbit challenging to debug actually \num \nand it's also there's there's also \num an overhead in in maintaining it \nbecause basically the way it works is is \num uh kind of the the API server the API \nhost declares an interface \num and then you compile that interface \ninto \num uh client libraries and so you need \nto make sure that all of the clients \nthat communicate with that \num \nwithout server have the latest version \nof those client libraries so there's a \nlittle bit over overhead in terms of \nmaking sure that all those client client \nlibraries are synced \num \nbut there's also there's also benefits \nto using a uh jrpc \num \nto string Services together \num you know I think I think \num uh the obviously the the most common \nway of stringing Services together is \nstill \num is still uh HTTP uh Json apis \num and I find that to be uh most uh most \nconvenient to kind of program against \nmaybe just like a quick thing out of I \nknow extremely little it is there more \nopportunity to kind of innovate on that \nwith respect to like \nbecause I've heard about like streaming \nTechnologies I also don't really know \ntoo much about what is under the hood \nbut from the perspective of you know \nlike vector database your your trying to \nsend your data to this embeddings \ninference API as fast as possible and \nget the vectors back or you know say \nyou're sending prompts and you're \ngetting the response back from the large \nlanguage models is there like a lot of \nopportunity to kind of interface on how \nyou do that networking \num in terms of streaming data from \nVector search databases \nI I suppose just I'm broadly asking \nabout the technology the whole like the \nwhole entire networking technology \ncategory and if this particular like you \nknow how how we're currently thinking \nabout you know how apis provide the Deep \nlearning embedding and then language \nmodel inference Services if that is \nalready as optimized as it can be or if \nthere's room for yeah \nyeah it's a good question \num I know \num the \num large language models a lot of them \num \nuh I know open open AI does this uh you \ncan you can stream completions right you \ncan stream chat completion and so it's \nsending you it's sending you tokens as \nit's producing them \num \nuh within our open source uh project \nwe've added uh We've added uh support \nfor uh a couple uh a bunch of other uh \nLMS \nuh so for example we support Google Palm \nuh I haven't I haven't seen assuming \ncapabilities within Google pawn yet uh \nalthough it should definitely add that \nso I think \num so I think VL alums themselves are \num pretty optimized \num obviously when you're uh when you're \nadding a lot of data \nuh when you're adding a lot of data to a \nvector search database uh I think \nthere's an opportunity to stream stream \nthat data yeah um as as uh as is being \nindexed \num \nbut I'm not \num I'm I'm not sure what what's some of \nthe other kind of uh opportunities are \nyeah it's it's really interesting I \nthink that whole category of model \ninference just the whole all the \nsoftware behind it whether you're you \nknow doing the Onyx optimizations of the \nmodel or like you know the \nTriton servers neuromagic is interesting \nor say you step into like the \ndistributed computation you know area \nwhere you have like Ray and Spark and I \nthink there's so much to that kind of \ntopic um yeah so so kind of coming out \nof this topic a bit I I think it would \nbe really interesting to just kind of \ntalk about to transition back into just \nthe meta around the evolving software \nspace can you talk about like your \nexperience in software and how that's \nchanged with the latest you know \nbreakthroughs in large language models \nand Vector databases \num \nyeah so \num one \num really big use case uh that also I've \nreferred to earlier is obviously uh \nsearch experiences right so \num building the keyword searches uh no \nlonger \num \nadequate \num \nso I think we ought to \num \noffer uh in a lot more uh kind of \nextensive \nelaborate uh search experiences right so \nsemantic search \num \nchat Bots \num are uh obviously becoming extremely \npopular \num so there's a lot of there's a lot of \nthings and workflows that could be in \nbusiness processes that could be \nautomated there with software \num and and also uh \nuh um \nyeah doing uh q a over your data sets uh \nso for example in in our uh link chain \nuh RB project uh we have \num uh We've we've built an agent that \ndoes a Texas SQL search so \num you know previously uh previously \nthere that there's a whole set of tweet \nthere's a whole set of tools that uh \ndata analysts uh used right to make kind \nof interfacing with underlying databases \nmuch easier and I think \num and I think these llm based \ncapabilities make it uh even more so \nconvenient to do that \nyeah I love that you brought up the text \nSQL thing it's so interesting to me like \num you know just seeing the trend in \nlike you know like social like \nentrepreneurs on social media like I \nremember you know there'd be a lot of \nlike here's how I started my social \nmedia agency you know I was like I make \n20K a month at 17 with my social media \nagency and it'll be you know and it's \nlike oh I help businesses like run their \nTwitter Instagram and that kind of thing \nand recently I've been seeing on you \nknow on YouTube with this kind of thing \nit's like oh I'm 19 years old I make \n100K a monthly with my um with my AI \nautomation agency and this kind of like \nchat bot and \nis like the skills that you need to \nbuild these kind of systems are are \nbecoming so different like or you know \nit's like no code is finally like really \na super serious thing do you think like \num and I think there's even kind of this \nis a topic that I think about like all \nthe time is this kind of like zero shot \nuh AI where you don't need to train it \nat all and so the you know you just kind \nof plug it in and you know you can be 19 \nyears old and set this up uh like do you \nthink like that kind of thing of like \ntraining the models compared to just \nsort of plugging in the zero shot LM \nzero shot embedding models setting it up \nthat way what what's your current stance \non that \nso first of all I would I would uh I am \nalways a little bit of I I'm always a \nlittle bit of uh skeptical of uh YouTube \ninfluencers \nbut claim to claim to make uh uh 100K a \nmonth so \nbut I you know uh back to your question \nI I think you have to uh you have to \npush off of \num \nyour uh product requirements uh in in \nbusiness use cases \num so there's a lot of times where a \ngeneric they call them found \nfoundational models right there's a lot \nof there's a lot of times where a \nfoundational model is either is either \nan Overkill \num \nand really you could just get away with \nuh a simpler model doing basic \nclassification tasks \num \nso there's a lot of times where \nfoundational model is either an Overkill \nuh or it's not best suited to \num to uh to accomplish the things you'd \nlike to accomplish \num \nso \nyou know the answer is uh it it really \ndepends \nyeah I mean um again referencing the \nunstructured podcast with Brian Raymond \nhe discussed um building a foundation \nmodel for visual document information \nextraction and I it was such an \ninteresting idea I hadn't considered \nthis idea of like a task specific \nFoundation models but it may like I'd \nalways kind of thought of this idea \nwhere you have this algorithm called \nknowledge distillation whereas like you \nuse the large model to label data to \nthen train the smaller model you know is \noptimized on that data and the key idea \nis instead of humans labeling data where \nyou have like a one hot Vector label \ndistribution that you optimize towards \nyou have this like soft distribution \nover the class label so you know it's \nlike 0.97 0.001 it like produces this \ndistribution that lets you distill the \nmodel but so like that's kind of the \ntechnical algorithm behind like \ncompressing the models and then you know \nbut just I guess we're seeing this take \noff where it's like regardless of how \nthat model is produced like what I'm \nsaying is maybe it's you know gbt4 \ndistilled into the a visual document \ncompared to where you just train that \nvisual document thing from scratch and \nthen you serve it like do you think that \ncould also be an emerging startup \ncategory is like Foundation model for \nyou know I don't know I can't I guess if \nI like creative but like some particular \nthing like maybe it's like like visual \nquestion answering has its own uh you \nknow its own Foundation model it's not \ngbt4 and then it's smaller or something \nlike that yeah yeah no absolutely \nabsolutely and there's there's a lot of \nuh there's a lot of companies that are \ntrying to do exactly that \num and offer uh task uh \noffer \num \napis \num that are \nthat are specific for specific tasks \nright so whether it's summarization \nwhether it's editing whether it's \nparaphrasing \num whether it's chat \num \nand uh yeah I think I think there's uh I \nthink there's a lot of opportunity there \nyeah I just remember this as I passed \nthe mic back I I was in Berkeley two \nweekends ago and I saw these researchers \nworking on this language model called \ngorilla and so gorilla is like a large \nlanguage model optimized for Tool use \nand like so I think especially as the \ncreator of Lang chain Ruby I think this \nwould be a great topic is like how do \nyou see tool use like just this whole \ntopic of llng using tools and how \nopen-ended that seems to be yeah so when \nwe when we talk about tools \num we're also talking about agents right \num and \nI I believe that the current consensus \nis that \num the the current agents \num \nfor kind of General problem solving \num are not very powerful right \num so there's emerging techniques \num \nbut uh the current conceptualization of \nagents and and the current techniques \nand the way they currently work \num uh they're not super useful \num so so obviously there's \num there's a Chain of Thought there's uh \nuh so for example in LinkedIn RB we have \na react agent \num \num there was another research that uh \ncame out there's another research paper \nthat came out recently uh called uh tree \nof thought uh which is uh which is kind \nof an evolution on top of the chain of \nfog technique \num \nand uh an agent uh coupled with uh with \ntools uh is basically uh exactly what \nkind of open AI offers with with its \nplugins \num but I'm not I'm not sure uh I'm not \nsure that the \nuh I I'm not sure about the agents are \nuh super useful just yet \nso we got a lot of that I want to unpack \nI want to start with the well okay so \nwe're definitely coming back to open AI \nthe plugins and now we have this new \nfunctions API and that's so interesting \nthen the you know hot today I meant I \nmeant the functions yeah oh I think both \nthose things are I think that's just \nthat whole thing and seeing how openai \nthemselves are clearly like exploring it \nas well it's like a whole I think this \nis one of the you know evolving things \nbut uh so I quickly want to come back to \nthat reference of building it in Ruby so \nwhen I think of tools I think of like \nyou know it uses like a calculator or it \nuses a code executor so like and then we \ntalked about monolithic architecture \nversus microservice architecture I think \nof these tools as like a micro service \narchitecture correct like where you know \nthe email API that you know calendar \nthese are all like API so so would you \ncook these tools to access into Ruby so \nlike the calendar the implementation of \na calculator is it stuff like that is \nthat I don't I don't know if I have the \ngreat example right now but maybe you do \nyeah yeah \nwell so so so one example that's uh \nmentioned in the length chain are uh \nlength chain RBS uh readme is uh this \nuh \nuh example of uh prompting uh prompting \nan llm a prompt using the react agent uh \nto calculate the distance between New \nYork City and DC \nuh uh in in \nuh in the number of full-length soccer \nfields right \nand so \nuh and so the way uh and so you're \nasking uh an llm to break down the steps \nand generate uh generate uh a set of \nactions right so reasoning and act \num uh generate a set of actions uh and \naction inputs um that it would uh it \nwould need uh in order to arrive uh to \nthe answer right and so \nit might say that the first action uh \nthat it needs to do is calculate the \ndistance between \num New York City and DC in in miles \nright and so if you expose it a tool to \nbe able to do that right \num it will uh it will try to use that \ntool right and so you obviously have to \nexecute that tool in in the code \ndirectly right so it would call \nuh you would call the Google Maps API \nand ask it for to go to send it back uh \nthe distance between uh DC and and New \nYork City right you would then take that \nobservation that result \nand send it back to the llm and ask it \nfor the next step right and so it would \nsay well now I need to know what the \nwhat uh what the length of a uh \nfull-size soccer field is right so you \nwould \ncall some sort of service uh that could \ngive you an answer to that question uh \nyou will then take that result package \nit as a as an observation send it back \nto vllm right so now it has two pieces \nof data right and now it just basically \nneeds to you know take the overall \ndistance and divide it by uh by the \nlength of a soccer field to calculate \nthe total number of of fields needed \nright to cover a distance \num so that's so that's an example of \ntool usage \nyeah I think what you're saying is \ninspiring something I've been thinking \nabout as well with um with go Lang \n[Music] \nso we Face written and going and um \ngolang is really good at like uh you \nknow handling concurrency control with a \nton of these parallel API requests and \nlike one thing that's built into \nalleviate weave has the generative \nsearch modules with which what they do \nis you know they take say you search a \nquery and then you have you know let's \nsay 20 search results and you want to \nsend each one in parallel to the openai \nAPI it's really good at like you know \nsynchronizing all those requests and \nthen and I think I haven't I don't have \na super concrete example yeah but as you \nmentioned the kind of like self-ask \nprompting and question decomposition I \nsuspect that there is something to like \nwhen to lock these like uh asynchronous \nkind of API requests and you lock the \nshared resource so that you don't \noverride it and so I do think that kind \nof orchestration there is a lot to that \nand I think using languages like going \nand I don't know what Ruby has with that \nkind of maybe you could talk more about \nruby and how it handles concurrency and \nthat kind of thing or I don't know too \nmuch \nyeah I mean short short answer is a lot \nof these uh high-level languages uh \ndon't handle concurrency all that well \num you know python Ruby it's kind of a \nsimilar story so \ninteresting um \nyeah yeah I mean I'm definitely not a \nprogramming language I only know like \ngolang because of the situation in which \nbut yeah uh yeah so that whole kind of \nthing um yeah so maybe we could talk a \nlittle more about the orchestration \nbehind particularly you mentioned the \nchain of thoughts tree of thoughts it \nsounds like you definitely need to have \na lot of um you know like templating in \nplace to kind of guide the apis to do \nthat kind of thing especially I mean \nwell Chain of Thought to me is just \nwhere you tell it to like break your \nplan down and or or the self-ass \nprompting that you just mentioned where \nyou need to take a question and then say \ndo you need to decompose this into two \nquestions and so on like how do you \nbuild the build a template around that \nto constrain it to follow this kind of \nbehavior \nyeah so we have uh we have output \nparsers \num \nspecifically specifically for before to \nuh uh to ask for a specific uh ask the \nlln for a specific type of uh output \nright so if you want to get uh Json back \nyou can supply your Json schema and say \nHey I want you to fill out this Json \num \num \nuh and uh we have uh prompt management \num so you can create your own templates \nuh you can fill out the templates you \ncan create new templates from scratch \nyou can save them uh so we're currently \nsupport yaml uh and Json uh formats \num and we also uh we also uh look at uh \nwe constantly have our eyes on the \nemerging research to make sure that our \nprompts our templates are using the best \npossible techniques right and there's \nand that's that's that's that's what the \nyou know that's kind of the gist of uh \nprompt engineering is being able to \nconstruct these uh concise yet detailed \nclear instructions for llms to give you \nthe output that you're looking for right \nyeah I love that topic I think um like \nthe discovery of prompts that work well \nis pretty interesting I mean I think \nlike people obviously kind of Snicker at \nthat a bit the idea that it's like \nengineering to be doing that kind of \ntweaking but I think I kind of respect \ncalling it engineering when you're \ntalking about like um \nyou know like the the way that the \nmodels switch and the new the you know \nlike gbt4 might react differently to the \nprompt and gbt3 does or you know cloud \nor you know MPT 30 billion so that maybe \nthere's some kind of compatibility to \nthe prompts and the models or yes what \ndo you think about yeah and is it \nengineering yeah yeah so I think I think \num that's that's that's a it's that's a \ngreat question and I think the fact that \nwe call it engineering \num actually points to our yearning \nfor prompting to be a much more precise \ndiscipline \nright \num I mean current prompting is kind of a \nhack right \num \nbecause it's it's \nI mean humans have a hard time \ncommunicating with each other right in \nin coming to a consensus of problem \nsolving and \num right and it's and uh when you're \nwhen you're interfacing with a system in \nin natural language uh it's it's \ndifficult to get it to do exactly uh \nwhat you wanted to do right \num and so and so \nand so I think when we call it \nengineering it's because we wanted to be \nuh much more precise \num and which which is why there's a \ngrowing concern and kind of \num \narea that people are exploring to to \nevaluate the effectiveness of different \nprompts right so being able to assign \ndifferent scores uh to input output sets \nright \num also referring back to the uh the \nwhole uh you know tree of thought uh \nresearch \nso uh you get a model to produce uh \ndifferent intermediary steps and for \neach step you ask it to produce \ndifferent samples and then you have to \nrate those different samples like how \nHow likely is this sample to get you to \nthe best possible answer right \num and so there's there's evaluation \nthere's kind of prompt evaluation uh \ninput output evaluation taking uh \ntaking place at at a different uh \nuh uh at all the different uh layers of \nthe stack \num and I'm not sure I'm not sure anyone \nhad uh had solved this uh just yet \num but \num yeah I think that's that that's why \nthat's why we're referring to it as as \nengineering \num \nyeah I love that like with my um like my \nexperience with doing a PhD in machine \nlearning where you're you know \ncollecting all these metrics about the \nexperiments and I think there still is a \nlot to that like um you know how you do \nthe input output evaluation deep \nlearning has like a long history and \nlike these benchmarks like imagenet \nclassification or like Ms Marco \ninformation retrieval where you or like \nSquad question answering because I think \nquestion answering is a good one that \npeople are thinking about when you like \nthink about these kind of things we have \nlike just collecting examples and then \nyou know looking through where it fails \nand seeing is there maybe you like \nvisualize the embedding space of all \nyour inputs and use and you color it \nlike green and red where it's failing \nand then you look in this distribution \nparticularly it fails can we do \nsomething about that and that kind of \ngeneralization testing thing with \nrespect to all you're doing is tweaking \nthe prompts instead of like thinking \nabout some whole another algorithm of \ntraining like I think mostly it's been \nlike you know the generalization testing \nis done to compare two models trained \nwith like massively different efforts \nright compared to this earth like just \ntwo different prompts and and cannot \nhave a profound difference in the test \nSuite right right right uh and this is \nthis is also a an area of concern in in \nuh \num in application testing right so \num you're testing input and output and \nespecially if you're if you're not using \na uh 0.0 temperature setting right which \nwhich means that uh you're you're going \nto get different results right \num and how do you account for all of \nthose different test cases in the \napplication \num so we're uh \nand this is one area that we're \ncurrently thinking through uh as as \nwe're building out link chain RV \nawesome super cool Andre I think this is \na really great coverage of these topics \nI think kind of a wrapping up question \nit's I'm really curious about sort of \nmaybe the Breakthrough in the next \nbreakthrough in AI deep learning that \nyou know would excite you the most it \nsounds maybe like you're an agents guy \nand you want to see the something with \nagents or maybe just the llm inference \ncosts going down what kind of things \nexcite you \noh that's uh that's a good question \num I think I I would love to see \nthe open source models catch up to uh \nopen open AI right \num \nit seems like it seems like gpt4 uh and \nuh open AI uh they're the leaders uh in \nthe space right now \num and obviously there's uh there's an \nemerging uh field of Open Source models \nright \num some of them are getting really good \num it's also becoming \nmuch much cheaper and uh kind of cost \neffective to run those models locally \nso I would love to I would love to see \nopen source catch up to some of the \ncommercial offerings so that we can we \ncan use much more powerful uh llms and \nrun them locally \nyeah or on on the on the cloud hmm \nyeah that topic is I mean it's super \ntimely with as we're recording this \npodcast Mosaic ml has just been acquired \nfor 1.3 billion dollars from data bricks \nand you know super lucky to have had \nJonathan Frankel on this we be a podcast \ntwice of you know not that the \ncollaboration has to end now or anything \nbut you know we've just you know been \nworking with the Mosaic ml people \nthey're super talented and and it makes \nme think a lot about this open source \nthing because I was so excited with the \nMPT 30 billion because \nI was also kind of like thinking like \nthis group of people I you know I think \nthey they're super talented I think they \ncan do it they'll create the open source \nversion of you know gbt and or drive the \ncost of it down all sorts of interesting \nthings um do you think like with like if \nwith them going to databricks what do \nyou think kind of the predictions of \nwhat they would continue to do \nyeah to be honest I I \nas as you know things are moving so \nrapidly and there's so many people in \nthe space right now \num doing very interesting things I I \nhave not had the opportunity to play \naround with uh mosaic if you see that oh \nokay yeah I mean I I don't mean to say I \nguess like MPC I mean there's definitely \nlike a bias towards what the latest \nthing is and that changes every single \nweek like one week exactly yeah exactly \nyeah I mean I do think uh databricks had \npublished I think their model was called \ndolly or something so I do think it's \nquite realistic that you know they just \nteam up and they keep pushing the open \nsource and that would be and that that \ncombination would be the horse I would \nbet on but I think there's also like uh \nthere's like stability AI has one \num I don't I know just like kind of like \nvicuna \nI think that one comes out of Burke I \ndon't know too much about about the \nwhole replicate replicate has a \nreplicated offering as well uh we \nsupport that within blank chain RB and \nactually \num to kind of bring it back to link \nchain RB \num what we're striving to do with link \nchain are B is provide a set a set of \nabstractions \nthat software Engineers can can \nunderstand \n[Music] \num \nand have the flexibility to swap out the \ndifferent llms right whether whether \nit's a SAS offering and you're \nintegrating with an API whether you're \nrunning uh whether you're running a uh \nvicuna model locally uh we want to make \nsure that you can easily swap those out \num because \nas as you've pointed out uh as we all \nknow the space is moving really rapidly \num \nwhat this what this base is going to \nlook like and who are the leading models \nright like in you know uh in a couple \nmonths in three six nine months from now \non is going to be completely different \nright \num but we want to make sure that if \nyou're integrating LinkedIn or be within \nyour stack and uh you decide to switch \nto a uh more cost effective model or \njust some more powerful model down the \nroad you can easily do that \nyeah I think that puts Lang chain and \nllama index these kind of tools that are \nreally interesting Market position is \nhow they let you rotate out the um you \nknow the models as well as the tools and \nyou might want to think of a model \ninference as a tool like again we talked \nabout you have a foundation model for a \nsuper specific thing and so you you know \nwhether you use gbt4 to come up with the \nplan and then it routes it to other \nmodel inferences you think of that as a \ntool I think that you know that kind of \nidea but and then there's also kind of \nlike the data you know like the database \nthings like I hear people discuss like \nhow Lang chain lets you you know ablate \nthe different Vector databases and that \nmakes total sense obviously like if you \nwant to say you know you want to use \nweeviate you want to try the whole \nVector database Market I think it's also \nreally interesting for you mentioned \ntext to SQL and you know we V8 does have \nan aggregate API so it's not like you \ncan't do that thing in weba but yeah \ntheir particular kind of join operations \nand relational database stuff I can \nimagine you'd want another kind of \ndative tool as well say like maybe the \ngraph database stuff has something to \noffer so yeah that whole positioning of \nit to uh wrap around these different \nServices I think that's super \ninteresting \nright right and actually and actually uh \none uh maybe a question that I would \neven post to to \nyour uh the rest of the weeviate folks \nis is that \num I like how \num I like how this how you guys \nstructure your schemas \nand and you can create schemas that \npretty much resemble a traditional \ndatabase right you have those different \ndata types that can that can mirror your \ndatabase \num and I've wondered whether you can \nactually use it alleviate as your as \nyour primary database \nand whether \nthis was in whether that was the \ndirection that uh aviatus is heading \ndown \nyou know I'd say there are the kind of \nlike the efficient data structures for \neach of the properties like inverted \nindexing on categorical Properties or \nsay like building up trees to search \nthrough you know numeric values \num the thing about this that I think is \nthe most interesting is the connection \nbetween \num how you would join tables in a \nrelational database compared to how we \nthink about joining classes in weviate \nbecause each class in weeviate has its \nown Vector index and so it's like you \nknow I think like with a lot of \nrelational database design you'd have \nlike customer you'd separate like the \ncustomer and the purchases and then like \nthe brand like your you know the supply \nchain you separated out into all these \ntables \nand so and then you kind of like join \nalong and \nI don't know I don't know if you want to \nsend embeddings like back through a \ngraph like that that's that like if if \nthat kind of thing just because I think \nthere are a lot of like under the hood \noptimizations behind how the relational \nalgebra of like when you're joining the \ntape you have like conditions for \njoining the table so there's like an \noptimal order to how you join the tables \nbecause like this one create this one \nreduces the cardinality to like five \nthousand versus like 50 000 right so I \nthink those kind of optimizations uh can \nbe made in Wii VA but it's not something \nthat I personally am super knowledgeable \nabout but to me the thing that I think \nabout more is this idea of like \nparticularly in like the recommendation \ncase there's examples of like graph \nneural networks where you like flow \nembeddings through relations like that \nlike you know user liked product product \nhas Brand these kind of things and so \nyou can like slow embeddings through a \ngraph and I think I think that's where \nlike knowledge graphs are gonna merge \nwith Vector databases in some kind of \ninteresting way but yeah that whole \ntopic of understanding joining tables or \nclasses that that's something that I \ndon't have a great answer for but I \nthink it's a super interesting topic got \nit yeah I mean what I'm curious about \nlike you probably have more experience \nin databases than I do honestly like \nwhat do you think about kind of like um \nyeah like what are the components of an \nSQL database system that Vector \ndatabases should you know make sure to \nadd to make it a make it a One-Stop shop \nfor your data \num that's that's yeah that's a very good \nquestion \num \nI think \num \nI so I obviously uh Vector search is \num such a large massive uh growing space \nthat \ntraditional data traditional database \nvendors are looking to add those \ncapabilities right so there's a \nthere's PG Vector uh postgres extension \nright uh we're aware of some of the \nother database vendors and adding those \ncapabilities yeah to their products \num \nand \num \nyou know there's there's there's kind of \npros and cons there \num the same way that there's pros and \ncons to \num \nuh having a monolith \num application architecture or a \nmicroservices \nuh Centric \napplication architecture \nyeah because it is isn't there there is \nsomething to when you compute there's \nlike indexes that you compute with um \nSQL where you're gonna join like 20 \ntables together like you've got like a \npayroll software right and so you so \nthere would be like a memory overhead to \nbuilding up those kind of indexes right \nsomething like that yeah and so the \nquestion then is um \nyeah I don't know I think it would \nprobably be a case-by-case thing I I do \nlike just the general thinking of like \nif you're asking a question like you \nknow what is the average age of uh \ncustomers who bought an Xbox game \ncontroller in March questions like that \nthat like I think you would always want \nto use an SQL system I can't imagine \nlike a semantic search llm thing being \nthe best answer to that particular kind \nof so right right so that's why when I \nlove that Texas SQL topic and then I \nlike to say you know leave it has an \naggregate API I don't know if maybe we \ncould build a SQL API I just don't know \nwhat even that would entail but yeah \nright right but it would interest \nsorry yeah yeah I mean if you're um \nyou know if you're trying to get the if \nif you have a list of products and \nyou're you're merely just trying to get \nthe uh the cheapest product or the most \nexpensive product than than yeah and as \na traditional SQL query will get you \njust just fine right but if you're \nsearching the product description \nuh in your certain searching for a uh uh \nif you're searching product description \num and you're searching for a product \nthat lets you accomplish certain things \nand then yeah semantic I think a \nsemantic search would be more suitable \nI mean I I did like just when Mosaic was \nacquired by databricks I did a little \nmore homework on like what is data \nbreaks and what stuff like and they \nbring they bring themselves as like \nstructured unstructured semi-structured \ndata Lake and and so I generally think \nthis idea that like unstructured and \nstructured you know data schemas have \nmore to learn from each other I think \nsemi-structured is where you like I \nthink like snorkel AI is one of the \npioneers of this idea of like \nprogrammatic labeling where you like \npredict missing structure from your \nunstructured data and \nyeah just I think there's a lot I think \nthat's a super how do you unify these \nthings I think that's one of the areas \nof innovation in these new kinds of \ndatabases \nyeah right right \num yeah and this this this problem uh \nthis dilemma has been has been around \nsoftware development for \nuh for decades yeah yeah it was super \ncool Andre thank you so much for joining \nthe podcast it's such a fun discussion I \nthink the you know the Ruby Klein \nhearing about the
