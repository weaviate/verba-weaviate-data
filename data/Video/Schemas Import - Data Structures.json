{"text": "Weaviate Academy Unit 3: Data Structures. \nhey and welcome back in this sectionwe'll provide a high level overview ofwaviate's data structure that meanswe'll take you through Concepts likeindexes the schema classes andpropertiesfirst let's talk about indexesindexes exist to help you find the rightdata fasterthey are pre-built and maintained fromyour data to do thiswhat this means is that when a querycomes in the system doesn't need to lookthrough every data object which can takea long timeinstead it can simply look through theappropriate index to find the right dataobjectsin weeviate there are two main types ofindexes the inverted index and thevector indexyou might be familiar with the invergedindex it's structured like a referencetable that allows you to quickly look upa term and find objects containing thattermthe vector index on the other hand isall about enabling efficient retrievalof vectors based on similarityand just like how the inverge indexspeeds up lookups for matching terms thevector index speeds up Vector similaritysearcheswaviate builds a vector index of yourdata in the background using anapproximate nearest neighbor algorithmso that it can perform back the searchesat Lightning Fast speedstogether these indexes enable vector orbm25 searches as well as a combinationcalled hybrid searchesthey also work together to allow Vectorsearches with filteringyou saw examples of this with wearfilters in query examplesyou saw how they were able to onlysearch with objects matching aparticular conditionso there was indexes which is all aboutenabling you to find the right objectsand fastnow let's discuss classes which is allabout how you structure your dataobjects in wavy8 in waviate collectionsof the same object types are calledclasses it's really important to notethat each class constitutes one vectorspace meaning that each object in thesame class is converted to the vector inthe same waygoing back to our color analogy acollection of RGB colors wouldconstitute one vector space as each ofthem would be represented by the samesystem of three numbers representing redgreen or bluenow if you had another set of CMYKcolors that would be a distinct Vectorspace from your RGB colors as not onlythere are four numbers but also eachnumber means something different to theRGB numbersso when you're designing your dataschema in waviate it's important togroup objects that you want to searchtogether in the same class since Vectorsearches can only be performed within asingle Vector spacefinally let's touch on schemasa schema in waviate is the blueprintthat defines all the things we've talkedabout and morethat's its data structure classesproperties vectorizers moduleconfigurations index configurations andmoreyou should know that thankfully youdon't have to Define every aspect of theschema manuallywebiate has an auto schema feature tobest infer any missing information asrequiredin the next section though we'll showyou some of the most important parts ofthe schema that you must Define and theywill build up your knowledge from thereto recap this section is all about thekey components of weavate data structureincluding indexes classes and schemasremember that indexes allow for fastdata retrieval classes grip objects inthe same type as one vector space andschemas Define aviate's data structureby understanding these key Conceptsyou'll be well equipped to make the mostof webiate's powerful Vector databasecapabilitiesthanks for watching and we'll see yousoon", "type": "Video", "name": "Schemas Import - Data Structures", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AmMDDGWC74", "timestamp": "", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
