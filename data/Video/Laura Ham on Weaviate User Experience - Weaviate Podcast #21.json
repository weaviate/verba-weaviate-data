{"text": "Thank you for watching the 21st Weaviate Podcast with Laura Ham! Laura Ham has worked on Weaviate at SeMI Technologies ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nchecking out the webv8 podcast today is \ngoing to be truly one of the most \nspecial episodes of the week a podcast \nwe've had so far laura hamm is making \nher debut on the wva podcast uh laura \nhas created so much amazing content that \nhelped me personally learn how to use \nwev8 and all sorts of things from wv-8 \nexamples to say the design of the \ngraphql and blog post tutorials around \nthis graph like data model and all these \nexciting things so uh laura thank you so \nmuch for coming on the webva podcast \nthank you conor yeah it's great to \nfinally be in your podcast \nso could we start with um the the \nintroduction of kind of the origin story \nof what led you to be working on vv8 \nyeah that's a good start so um that goes \nback already like five years i think \nuh when i started working together with \nuh both the one of the founders of of \nsammy and weaviate \num yeah back then we were working both \nas a freelancer or some other projects \nand bob started working on on wev8 \nand \ni think like we were both super \ninterested in natural language \nprocessing and how like all the \ndevelopments in that world happened and \nthat's where yeah we started \ncollaborating and \num \nyeah started working on we fade \nbasically \nso i think bob tells us when i asked him \nhow he first got into this he says the \nking minus queen plus man that kind of \nthing was that a similar inspiration for \nyou that led you into this uh vector \nembedding kind of part of natural \nlanguage processing \nyeah yeah definitely so at the time you \nhad like these first word effect models \nfor example \nuh coming up and with word effect of \ncourse words are represented as vectors \num \nand that's also where you have this king \nminus \num \nman plus female is queen thing uh is \ncoming from of course \nso \nbasically with these algorithms like \nword to fact we were like they allowed \nus to \nuse neural networks to understand \nlanguage \nand word associations \nand um \nyeah what's what's been really \ninteresting to me um \nspecifically is that you can calculate \nthen like how similar \nuh different words or different concepts \nare uh to each other so you can find \nsynonyms or related concepts \nwhich is of course very relevant if we \ntalk about \na search \nbecause i think like \nbefore \nwith natural language application \napplications \npeople were working are still working a \nlot with ontologies or taxonomies \nand \nthink like ontologies and taxonomies \nthey need to be \ndefined beforehand so before you start \nusing an application \nand \ni see the potential problem or challenge \nthere is that \nthere is also always one or more people \ndefining this ontology or taxonomy and \nthey have to agree on some \nmeanings of words because in an ontology \nyou have a word and you have the context \nof the word or what it means \nso people have to agree on this meaning \nand um that's really hard if you work \nwith a lot of people \nyeah basically if you then yeah then you \ndon't know how to deal with sign names \nor \nyeah you basically have to deal with \nokay i want to give the best search \nexperience to a user so you need to know \nwhat kind of words he or she is using \num \nas an ontologist and i think this is one \nof the the problems that \nalgorithms like word to fact or like the \nbirth models today with neural networks \ncan solve \nyeah i'm really excited to dive into the \nontologies and and yeah i remember \nanother story baba told about they \ncouldn't agree whether it's a sea or a \nlake and that kind of idea where you \nhave the disagreement on the terms and \nand uh going to new york with you and \nseeing the ontologies the symbolic \ngraphs i had never really been exposed \nto that kind of thing before but i \nquickly want to dive a little deeper \ninto the into your five years at uh semi \ntechnologies in wva can you tell me \nabout sort of the and then we'll kind of \nget deeper into how we evade itself has \nevolved but how has your experience with \nthe kind of startup company growing how \nhas that been \nyeah yeah that's been great so um so \nlike five years ago i started more in a \nresearch-like position so i was looking \nat technologies like word effect and how \ncan we use that to build a \ngood neural search experience basically \num so i've been experimenting a lot \nbuilding a lot of prototypes to test um \nand \nwhat's good to mention i think is that \ni've been working with like real users \nor the customers from the start so we \nreally learned from them what their \nchallenges are and like how we can solve \nthem and test things out \nso \nyeah i was really more like a research \nposition \nback then i was also still \nstudying i was doing a master's degree \nin human computer interaction \nso that also like the lessons that i \nlearned in my studies i could directly \napply in \nthe research that i did with review \nbecause my goal was to make \nthe search experience or the yeah user \nor developer experience of \nnatural language processing \nor search search engines as friendly as \npossible so it was really good that i \ncould \nput it in practice directly \nso \nand during that time of course the \nstartup started to grow so we've it got \ndeveloped uh \nuntil like the version \nuh 1.0 we had like two years ago i think \nand since then the team has also been \ngrowing and that's just really amazing \nto see \nso \nyeah during that time i've also been \ndoing a lot of talks at conferences \ni've been in close contact with the open \nsource community so always like trying \nto grow the community uh learn from \ntheir feedback that they have \nand um \nyeah since i was involved in \nimproving the developer experience i for \nexample designed the whole graphql api \nthat we still have today and the \ndocumentation that is still out there \nyeah those kind of things \nand then now that the team is like \nway bigger \ni can focus more uh on like \nuh \nyeah one thing again that's more like \nthe research \nso it's really exciting \nyeah that's so interesting and i'm \nreally curious so could we dive a bit \nmore into the human computer reaction \nand the user experience the graphql \ndesign \ni love how it has this like we've eight \nhas this get and then you can chain on \nthese functions like if you want to do \nthe near text search the near vector \nquestion asking and then accessing the \nproperties of your data i can take me \nthrough the design of the graphql and \nmaybe principles from human computer \ninteraction what what that kind of field \nof study how does it help you think \nabout these kinds of things \nyeah yeah super interesting so \nyeah first i will take a step back so \nfirst i want to share \nlike share \nwhy we have graphql so \num because we also have normal restful \nand restful api endpoints \nand but those like rest \napi endpoints are more for accessing the \nresources so accessing the data so \nuh updating data \nuploading data um \ndeleting data you can all do those kind \nof things stressful but then if you want \nto start searching through it \num \nyou need a yeah you cannot \num \ndo it in one \nyeah single url query basically \num so that's i mean the user experience \nof doing a search in a restful like way \nit's really hard \nso that's why we started looking at \nrafcal basically \num \nand yeah \nof course like when i started designing \nit my first goals were \nyou know the the general \ndesign principles that you should have \nwith api design like it should be \nintuitive to be \nreadable \n[Music] \nyeah simple as possible like consistency \nin terms of naming etc \num \n[Music] \nand then i started designing and then i \nthought okay we're we're building a \nsearch engine which works \nfor example with semantic search in text \nor images but \nso i wanted to \nalso give a nice experience when you \nwrite a query that it feels like you're \nwriting it in natural language \nand that's where the \nthe get and then \nnear text \nand then like the class and properties \ncome from because you can really read it \nas okay i want to get \na data that is of type article \nand from that i want to see the name \nthe content the authors and so on and i \nwant to find articles that are near \nthis piece of text \nso i want to yeah i try to integrate the \nhuman language as much as possible in \nthere yeah well that was really well \nsaid i really like that flow of it and \nand and that also helped me understand \nsort of the difference between the rest \napi and the graphql api if you want to \nhave like arguments to a rest api you \nhad to have like this long url right \nwith like the question mark and that \nkind of thing yeah exactly \ncompared to like stacking it out with \nthe graphql right \nyeah it's really interesting the idea of \na \nnatural language interface with a search \nengine on \nsay like multi-modal data arbitrary data \nwhere you could say uh give me a picture \nof a dog playing with the ball i don't \nknow but like that kind of natural \nlanguage uh interface experience uh so \ncould we then kind of transition a bit \nto um so when you have the graphql and \nyou have the new ux how does that tie \ninto the \nvector database of webva and the all the \nindexing stuff and how does the whole \nteam kind of coordinate that kind of \nthing \nyeah so right now we have like a big v8 \ncore team so like possessive core \nengineers who are really building uh \nabbreviate \nand next to that we have like the \nresearch team that you and i are in \num and um \nyeah so the goal is to have like we do \nresearch like we find new technologies \nthat might be a potential feature or \nlike an improvement or something \nand our current approach now is that \nyou know we um we pick up these things \nwe test if they are useful for us we do \nlike experiments um yeah to evaluate it \nand then the goal is to come up with a \ngood design for which we can pass on to \nthe core team let's say and this design \nthat consists of \nyeah what this technology is but also \nhow it should look like from a user \nperspective \nso how it should be used by user and um \nyeah that's that's a really important \nthing that we uh \nfind really important with building vva \nis that we always try to have the \nhighest ux as possible so \n[Music] \nthat means the design is from an api \nperspective because wav8 ends at api \nlevel so \nall the things that the user or \ndeveloper using vfit will see is an api \nlevel \nso this is the user experience and from \nthere we start building a design \nbasically \nand \nyeah so once we have that we can pass it \nto their core team \nand they can start building uh and do it \nlike um \nin the most efficient way of course and \nso on \nso when you when \ni want to ask about your approach to the \nresearch process and when you see new \npapers or new ideas coming out do you \ninstantly have this perspective of okay \nwhat would this look like in we v8 is \nthat your first kind of \napproach to thinking about it \num \nyes and no so of course i'm always \nthinking about like can we use this with \nrev8 yes or no but it's like um i kind \nof address a bigger question um and that \nis \ndoes it add value in \na search experience \nso weaving is a effective search engine \nso the goal is that people can use this \nto improve their yeah search experience \nso if it's a really nice new \ntechnique or new machine learning model \nor whatever \nthat is not related to this or would not \nimprove the search experience then i \nmight use it for something else but not \nfor we've yet obviously so there's \nalways this bigger question in my head \nlike okay can we use this to improve the \nexperience basically \ncan i ask about the like the development \nof search and the application of search \nhas any particular say use cases that \nyou use to reason about most uh like \nmost problems say like the question of \nwho's the best basketball player of all \ntime searching through wikipedia like do \nyou use these kind of like examples to \nmo to like guide your thinking \nuh yeah i think there's always use cases \nin mind when i um \nwhen i think about usability or like uh \nfor potentially new feature \nand \nyeah this of course can come from my own \nimagination but it can also come from \nwhat i get back from like open source \nusers or um \nyeah other people that use a search \nengine \nwhen you find yourself designing things \ndo you ever like maybe \ngo too particular into one application \nand then have to think about how does \nthis generalize out or is it \nyes that's a tricky thing right so it's \num yeah of course like of course you're \nyou're sometimes i'm experimenting and \nthen you really dive into one subject \nbut then it's really important to indeed \ntake that step back and then generalize \nand think okay \nis this only useful for this particular \nproblem or can it be \nuseful in more situations and both is \nfine but you need to be aware of what \nwhat case it is basically \nyou generally have like maybe like less \nis more is that kind of a good way of \nthinking about \nhow you kind of design these like \nlike function calls almost like when you \ndesign like a graphql api it's kind of \nlike a function maybe the the more \nsuccinctly you can describe it is that \nthe better way kind of generally \nyeah that's a \ngood way of looking at it i think of \ncourse it should be \nit should be simple and intuitive but if \nyou oversimplify it that's that's also \ndangerous of course it should still be \nclear what it means \nand um \nyeah now that we see that we um \nare adding more and more features to \nimprove the whole search pipeline \nbasically this also um \nyeah so another topic comes to my mind \nnow is that how do we scale this uh \ngraphql api to serve all the possible \nuse cases \nbefore we had like um \nyou could do you could use rev8 for just \na semantic search so it would be a \nsimple \nquery where you have one \n[Music] \npiece of text or one image that you \nwould search by \nbut now with all like um \nyeah other methods to increase like make \nthe pipeline bigger \nuh to improve the search experience and \nimprove the results basically \num the graphql should also be uh \nyeah so be able to support that of \ncourse and then yeah it becomes really \ndifficult to \nto come up with a good language that \nsupports it basically \nyeah i'm so excited about this idea of \nthe adding new features and building out \nthe pipelines uh quickly before we dive \ninto that can we talk about say uh what \ngoes into the integrations with uh you \ndeveloped these coding tutorials of how \nto combine wev8 with gina and wev88 with \nhaystack how's your experience been \nmaking these like open source tools fit \ntogether \nyeah yeah that's really exciting so uh \nhaystack by by deep set and \ngina as well are neural search \nframeworks which basically means that \nthey focus on the entire ecosystem \naround neural search so that goes from \nlike data pre-processing and fine-tuning \num to the search \nas well \num \nand \nyeah those frameworks are like should be \nused in in python \nand that's really nice if you want to \nbuild like a whole search experience \nright \num \nbut if you want to scale this to \nproduction or to like big data then you \nalso need an efficient database that \nlies underneath this application \nbasically and that's yeah rephrase one \nof the possible \nyeah databases that supports this so \nsince i think the beginning of this year \nwe have these integrations with haystack \nand gina that if you use their framework \nyou can use review as a \ndatabase needed basically \nand \nyeah that's just super cool to work with \nwith these people on this project \nyeah i think that's a super interesting \nuh connection obviously being like part \nof we've had i like the vector database \nand where you have the h and sw \nefficiently find the nearest neighbor \nstructure with the persistence and the \ndatabase features then you can \ni put pipe stream pipeline that upstream \nto things like question answering \nre-ranking and overall thinking about \nthese pipelines so i'm super excited to \ndive into this topic of search pipelines \nso we have maybe retrieval we could have \nsentenced transformer retrieval bm25 \nretrieval aggregate step and then cross \nencoder all these things can you take me \nthrough your understanding of search \npipelines \nyeah that's a good question so \num how i see it is that like basic \ninformation retrieval \num that comes like that interacts with a \ndatabase so if we have we've ate as \ndatabase \nthen \na basic information retrieval is just \nlike making query and getting some \nresults back from the database \nthis however so we use \nbi-encoders \nmodels so that's \nour neural networks that \nmake factor representations out of words \nor sentences um \nand then \nlike data will be basically retrieved in \nwv8 by comparing the vector of a query \nand comparing \nwith the \nvectors of the data objects \nso \num this is a really efficient method um \nbut it also comes with some drawbacks \nthat is \nmaybe not as accurate as you want to be \num \nfor this like we also next to buy \nencoders that create vectors out of \nwords we also have cross encoders \nso cross encoders do not produce vectors \nbut they \ncompare a query directly with a sentence \nor a word and give a value between zero \nand one \nhow similar it is \nthis \nthis kind of methods if they are trained \non the \nyeah \nrepresentative data set \nhave a higher recall like higher higher \naccuracy than \na buy encoder \nbut it comes with a cost because it's \ncomputationally very expensive \nso what's interesting now is if we \ncombine these cheap methods of buying \ncoders with the more expensive but more \naccurate methods cross-encoders so \nthe idea is basically to have like use a \nbuy encoder to retrieve initial set of \ndata \n[Music] \nwhich is a subset of the of of course \nall your data \nuh relevant to your search query and \nthen re-rank them \nuh reorder them based on a cross-encoder \nwhich can be executed \nbecause it's uh like a shorter list \nbasically \num so that's one way to improve the \ninitial results of information retrieval \num \nyeah and there's uh i can go on with \nlike more ways \nso we have um \nyou can all so this was one way of \nre-ranking results basically you can go \non with that so if you want to \npersonalize search based on some user \ninformation for example \nyou could use another re-ranker to \nre-rank those results again and \nhave the most relevant results to this \nuser place on top so you can basically \nextend this pipeline \nwith many models uh that you want \nuh to \nhave a like a good search experience \nyou know \ni love what uh so i think bob pitched \nthis idea of having like um you're in \nthe ocean and you cast a big fish net \nand you get a bunch of fish on the boat \nwith retrieval and then say you have to \nhave \nlike workers who pick up the fish and \nit's more expensive to have the workers \ncompared to the fish net then they're \nmore accurate at looking at the fish and \nmaking sure it's the fish you're looking \nfor \nso one of the topics that really excites \nme about this is thinking about this \nkind of zero shot generalization thing \nand these models that have been \npre-trained and they come off the shelf \nand \nwith retrieval models say it's kind of i \nsay i think like the deep learning end \nof we've eats vector representations are \nbuilt on these pre-trained sentence \ntransformers let's say \nthey have data sets like wikipedia where \nyou use the heuristic of neighboring \nparagraphs make these representations \nsimilar or maybe you have like the ms \nmarco data set where they've \npublished like a million uh query \ncorrect result or like what they clicked \non pairs and so you use that to train \nthese retrieval models and then it's \nbeen trained on such a big data set that \nyou say it will \ndo this zero shot generalization to your \nproblem \nand i think this kind of way that we \nhave these pipelines you see it as a way \nto say correct the error of zero shot \nretrieval so you know the you're trying \nto search through say the we vva \ndocumentation and you're trying to use \nretrieval from wikipedia and of course \nthere's a bit of a domain shift so maybe \ninstead of having to fine-tune our \nretrieval model we could just fine-tune \nthe cross-encoder right or these kind of \nthings how do you see this kind of like \nzero shot generalization of the \nretrieval and the cross encoder we could \nhave zero shot cross encoders too \ndoes it make it like simpler to adapt it \nto your problem kind of or \nyeah i think yeah that's really \ninteresting so i think we need to \nexperiment with that what works best \nbecause i think if you have \nso if you have the review like a vpa \ndocumentation which contains a lot of um \nlike specific words to alleviate which \nof course do not appear in wikipedia \num then if you just use this model train \non wikipedia it doesn't work right on \nyour technical documentation \ni think \njust um \njust fine-tuning a cross-encoder like \nretraining a cross-encoder \nwouldn't necessarily solve the whole \nproblem because if the results were not \ncaught in this big net of fish in the \nfirst place then the expensive fishman \ncannot find the right fish anyways so we \nalso \nneed to \nmake sure that \nthose right fishes are initially already \ncaught in that big net basically \nand \nyeah so that might mean we also need to \nfine-tune a bi-encoder \nor what's also really interesting is \nuh combine it with um with sparse search \nso for example bm25 which just looks at \num \nso it doesn't use neural networks or \nanything it just looks at uh the words \nitself \nso bm25 is maybe like a like a cage like \na lobster cage like it like we have like \nour fish net and we have maybe like some \nother kind of fishing device how do you \nsee the interplay of uh of the bm 25 and \nthe sentence transform i think it's a \nbig question but \nlike just kind of taking it from the \nbeginning what like what does bm25 add \nto sentence transformers or that they \neach miss out on \nyeah yeah that's super interesting so \ni think like before we had just sparse \nmethods so just \ntf idf bm25 \num which just used like exact words to \nretrieve uh data \num but now like of course these bm25 and \ntfidf methods they don't know anything \nabout synonyms or glycemi \nso that's where dense methods so methods \nthat are \ntrained with a neural network to \nunderstand the language \nsolve that problem \nbut if you just use dense methods like \nlike review is using \nas we speak \nthen \nif you use that on a data set that is \nnot \nuh \nlike as out of domain of your trading \nset basically \nyou might see problems um and that can \nso then \nit becomes interesting to combine \nvm \nlike methods with dance encoders to \num yeah bridge that gap basically \nbecause i think like \nif you are if you have a search query \nthat contains some very specific words \num \nlike um \nwhat does near text do in wv88 if you \nwant to search by that \nthen we know that you really need to \nhave the word near text in your result \nso if we use bm25 on that query \num \nwe will see \nfor sure \nresults with near text but if we just \nuse that by encoder we might see \nrelevant results but maybe the near text \nisn't really on top or like \num \nso yeah if we combine those methods i \nthink they like can solve a lot of out \nof domains problem problems \nyeah it it definitely seems like they \ncomplement each other well and i think \nthis comes back into the user experience \ndesign and \nhow you're going to interface with these \ntwo ways of search so i guess \nmaybe the most straightforward way to do \nit would be to have say an aggregation \nscore right where you have like 0.5 \ntimes the bm25 score plus 0.5 times the \nsentence transformer \nscore \nuh rank maybe might be a way to like \nheavily emphasize so so how is how would \nthe user interface design then take a \nconcept like bm25 send this transformer \nand then create an experience in which \nyou can combine them easily for search \npipelines \nyeah yeah that's super interesting so \nfirst we need to find out like what are \nall the possible ways that you can \ncombine them because the the way you \njust described is like a linear way so \nyou have on you do \nboth searches so the dance search and \nsparse search \nin parallel parallel and then you um \ndo like um \nalpha times the dance better times the \nsparse and you combine them so that's a \nlinear way \nwhat you could also do is use \nrf method and what that means is \nyou take both result lists \nand you don't look at the individual \nscores but you look at the order so \nthe results that appear on top on both \nresults will appear on top in the final \nresult as well \nso \nthese are already two methods of \ncombining the results basically maybe \nthere are more \num so we need to make sure we \nfirst look at okay which methods to \ncombine them are \nrelevant um and then secondly to \nsupport them in a graphql design or like \nanother way of \nin an api it doesn't have to be graphql \nmaybe um \nyeah that also supports if there are \ncoming more methods coming in the future \nthat also supports like \nuh yeah to be able to scale to that \nbasically \nthis is one idea that uh that i think we \ntalked about a little bit recently that \ni think might be kind of overdoing it \nbut do you think maybe when you have a \nquery you kind of classify whether this \nis a query that should go to bm25 and \nyou should kind of add one more part in \nthe pipeline where \nuh the query what is near text in wva \nand then this \nquery intent classifier or pipeline \ninference thing goes this is pretty \nentity centric we should probably send \nthis to bm25 and weight it according to \nthis \nfunction do you think that would maybe \nadd like too much to it or do you think \nthat maybe could \njust \ni guess coming back to the user \nexperience it could compress it a lot \nbecause you just have this thing that \ncreates the pipeline and then it's like \nuh \nlike pipeline wizard or something \nlike that \nyeah yeah that's super interesting so um \ni think we're definitely moving in that \nway that we like um \nso we've it itself is already modular \nand i think like the whole graphql or \nlike the whole api maybe it is not \nrascal uh whole api design should also \nbe modular so i picked this element in \nmy pipeline this element i want to \ncombine them like this um \nand then \num yeah and then like you said like \nlooking at the queries or really query \nparsing and doing maybe even some \nmanipulation to the create to make \nuh the list of results better \nin the end \num yeah that i think that's that's super \ncool so if you like what's what i saw in \nresearch is that \nbm25 queries which are very specific so \nbasically long queries with a lot of \nentities or named entities in there \nthey \num achieve a higher score in the result \nlist \nthan um than shorter queries or like one \nword queries so if we could somehow \nlearn from a query if it is very \nspecific or not we can give a higher \nscore to the bm25 compared to the dense \nmethods \nand this leaves a lot a little bit of \nexperiment but i think this is \ndefinitely what the way we're moving \nyeah i really want to dive back into the \nmodular design but you brought up \nsomething that i think is pretty is \nreally interesting in that um you know \nit doesn't always have to be so \ncomplicated right like something like \njust the length of the query could be \nenough of a heuristic to tell you which \none you probably want to use i can also \nask about the design of the \nuh the scalar filters how you can say do \na vector search but then you can also \nkind of label it symbolically and filter \nthe search that way how how did that \nkind of come to be in the \ninspiration of combining it that way \nwith \nuh simple kind of filters as well as \nthis kind of \nvector alignment right \nyeah yeah um so that's really around the \nstrong points of rehab i believe so \nif you \njust have a vector index or vector \nyeah vector index where you can store \nvectors and retrieve vectors \num \nthat are basically algorithms like um i \nthink like files and scan you can just \nput vectors in there but not the data \nobject itself \nso if you do \nso you can do just a vector search which \nmeans you \nput a vector as inputs you get vectors \nas output \nbut that's not really usable if you talk \nabout real data because you want to see \num the actual data object \num so we've a doesn't only store the \nvectors but it also store the actual \ndata object \nwhich means \nyeah if you search by one you can if you \nsearch by vector you can \nget actual results back \nthat belong to two vectors of \ncourse \nbut then we've it also combines this \nvector search with like you said the the \nstructured filtering um we call this a \nwear filter so like in sql you can put \nthe air filter \nand that um \nso in that you can say some restrictions \nto your search some filters so let's say \nyou want like the color of your product \nalways to be read in the results then \nthis is a really strict filter what then \nhappens in a search if you combine this \nwith a near text search we will first \nperform this \nstructured filtering \nand it uses like inverted indexes for \nthat \nwhich then creates an allow list for an \neffective search so it's a two-step \napproach basically and yeah i think that \nthat's really \nthat's \nyeah really cool from a technical \nperspective but it's just really \num \nyeah it's just something you need to \nhave from a ux perspective if you talk \nabout the database i think \nyeah i think that's huge for the the ux \nof deep learning search generally if the \nif you are getting a nearby uh \nshoe image and you can filter it with \nthe red uh color tag you you already get \na much better kind of uh space of that \nand \nso i see kind of a couple ways of taking \nthis conversation but quickly i wanted \nto talk about the idea of \ni just quit just kind of the comparison \nof face and weaviate and uh how you can \nstore the symbolic things so \nmaybe to give like a quick example of \nsomething i've been doing is studying uh \nyou have archive title abstracts and you \nvectorize the abstracts and you store \nthe vectors in weaviate but then you \nalso store the index \nand so what that lets you do is then you \nwant to take the title and see if you \ncan find the matching abstract and you \ndon't just have the vector because then \nyou don't know if it matched it or not \nyou also have the index so that's like \nkind of one example that i've been doing \nthat shows how storing the additional \nthings in addition to the \nvector \nhelps you like study these things and \nthen also i'd say if the topic is \nweaviate versus face having that \npersistence of the database layer is \nsuper useful for this because it takes a \nsuper long time to like upload a million \nvectors right and and that kind of thing \nso having it like it's going to stay in \nthere as a database \ni've also found that to be incredibly \nuseful so uh and then so \ni know i'm kind of jumping around the \nconversation topic but so what so this \ninverted index thing is like um you \ninvert the category so it's red and then \nthe things that have the property read \nhow does an inverted index and the h w \nindex how do those two things coexist \noh that's a good question that's really \ntechnical \num so \ni think inverted index is something that \nwe know already from relational \ndatabases \num \nbasically what yeah like you said what \nyou do is you invert \nthe yeah the properties of a data object \nin \nin the table \nso instead of like having each data \nobject with a property and a value you \nwould have a value first and then each \ndata object that has this value \num which \nthat basically just improves the \nefficiency like it has a \nlower latency \ni think that the whole h and sw is like \num \nthat's an yeah in a n algorithm so uh \nbrookside's nearest neighbor algorithm \nthat allows for very efficient \num vector search so that's on the other \nhand basically \num \nyeah \nyeah i think the that approximate \nnearest neighbor thing is definitely one \nof my uh my favorite topics around we've \ngate and i'd i love to get back into the \nmodular thing but can you tell me about \nyour experience with the approximate \nnearest neighbors kind of how you first \nbecame introduced it introduced to it \nand then sort of \nwhat that unlocks sort of when you're \nthinking about these search pipelines \nyeah so a n \num so let me take a step back so if you \nhave like \num a database full of vectors which are \nlike basically points in a high \ndimensional space \nand you want to search through it you \nbasically want to do a k n search so \nnearest neighbor search from a certain \npoint and this point is your search \nquery \num \nso with k n you basically retrieve all \nthe elements or all the vectors with \ndata objects that are closest to this \nsearch query \num \nand it retrieves yeah all of them to \nlike how big you want to have it \nbut if you want to do this on a large \nscale and with large i mean i don't even \nmean billions or millions but even \nthousands it's really expensive so the \ncomputation time to retrieve those \nnearest neighbors is really expensive \nso that's where you \nthat's when that's why \na and m so approximate nearest neighbor \nalgorithms were introduced \num because \nyeah if you have like a real \nuh \nreal-time application with a lot of data \nthen k n1 skill and basically \nh and sw so using graphs basically to \ndo this kind of uh \nyeah sure \nretrieving the nearest neighbors but \nlike approximately \nis one way of doing it \nyeah i think it's amazing i mean doing \nthe like i've been doing some tests \nwhere i'm doing the exact nearest \nneighbor and it really takes a crazy \nlong amount of time \nso i yes i think that's such a huge part \nof it and so we could then come into \nlike the modular design and user \nexperience and so like one module of the \nmodular design would be the these vector \nindexes the inverted uh object indexes \nfor say the color is red the hospital \nname is etc the state is etc whatever \nthese symbolic filters and then kind of \ngoing upstream to modules like \nnear text \npipelines \nquestion answering and then also it's \nkind of this um how this enables the \nintegrations with uh gina and haystack \nis this kind of modular design right and \num so i wanted to ask about the you've \nmade videos on how to add custom modules \nand i want it kind of asked this topic \nabout the extensibility of webv8 and \nadding custom parts to it \nyeah so first like talk a bit about how \nthis modular design works \nso basically aviate itself is is a \nvector search engine vector database \nso without any modules it's a pure \nvector \ndatabase \nso that means you need to upload your \nown vectors with your data and query it \nwith your own vectors \nthen you can use for example a \nbuy encoder or like \na retriever model like a bird model \nsentence bird model or resnet50 for \nimages you can add that as module on top \nof wev8 to \ncalculate the vectors \nof your data and of your search queries \nif you don't have them yet \nso \num \nyeah we've yet offered some of these \nmodules out of the box so we have our \nown trained modules \nwhich are very lightweight but there is \nalso \nmodules like you can use every \nmodel that is published on hugging face \nfor example \nor open ai which have pre-trained models \navailable to do this kind of inference \nand um yeah so you can use these modules \nfor these models as an alleviate module \nwith vvas \num \nyeah then to your question you can also \nlike not choose not to use any of these \npre-trained models but \nuse a model that you trained on your own \nor \nwhatever \num \nyeah so basically what you then do is \nyou \nuse basically design of a \n[Music] \nyeah if you have text you use design of \na text factorization module in viveviate \nand instead of \nlike \ntalking to this module model from \nhugging face you talk to your own model \nvia \n[Music] \napi calls \nyeah i think that the graphql design is \nso intuitive for how you can chain these \nthings together and i definitely think \nthat whole thing is really interesting \nand so i'm sorry to be uh sort of \njumping around the topics a little bit \nbut i think um \nso we've talked about kind of like we've \neaten i think something that makes it so \nunique we've we have the um the vector \nindex and how that plays with the \ninverted object index for adding these \nsymbolic filters but then one other big \npart of like the we va data model that \nthat i really think is interesting i \nwant to talk about is the graph like \ndata model and having relations between \nyour data and how you can say uh \nuh what's the hackernoon or it's a wine \nwas the wine was made in and then like a \nbrewery or \noriginally from say france and place \nlike that so can you tell me about the \ngraph like data model and how you can \nlink things each thing can have its own \nh and sw and \nuh inverted index right with each of the \nclasses that you'd link together with \nthese um cross references \nyeah yeah that yeah um so \nwe we then review like the the data \nmodel works like you have cluster \nclasses so data classes \nwhich have a name for example a wine um \nand like this data class can have some \nproperties with some value so property \ncan be as you said or like it can be the \nname of the wine \nso you have class wine and then like a \nvalue name of the wine you have uh \num whether it's um \nmaybe like the type of grapes or \nwhatever and then but you can also \ndefine like where it's coming from um \nwhere it's like who is the producer \nwhich color has it \num \nso but yeah these uh properties can be a \nclass on itself so if you have a lot of \nwines and you see that \nthe countries for example is a limited \nlist of course so you can also make a \nclass out of this country you probably \nwant to do that \nso then from the wine you can refer to \nwhich country it's coming from \nand um yeah this is basically \na graph \nlike model \num because you can make close references \nbetween one and the other in a \none-to-many um \nrelationship kind of \nyeah way \nyou think maybe we could sort of try to \npitch how we could put the we va \ndocumentation into this kind of \num this kind of data model so \none way that i like it the most is with \nthis kind of multi-modal sense where um \nsay \nlike using the twitter thing for example \nwhere you have tweet has image \nand then so you can separate out the \nlike text vector index with the image \nvector index and i also see you could do \nthat with like code also maybe like so \nif we have like a we've yet uh \nin the vva documentation say there is a \ntutorial and we want to say has code has \ntext and then you have \na code vector index so if you want to \nsearch just for a code snippet you can \nkind of isolate it that way \nis this making sense how i'm trying to \ndescribe this like could you take me \nthrough how you might decompose that \ndata and then organize it in this kind \nof model \nyeah yeah multi-modal models are really \ninteresting because \nwhat \nso if a machinery model is trained on \nboth text and images they can represent \nit in \nthe same vector space \nthis means you can search by one \nmodality for example text and find \nresults in the other for example image \nor code \nso \num \nyeah this is really interesting because \nthe way we need we need to vectorize \ntext is is like uh different from like \nhow we look at images so what is \ncaptured in the image so combining these \nor in code so combining these into one \nmodel \nallows us to search through them \nby whichever modality we want and this \nis also something that we can use in the \ndocumentation later documentation search \nbecause the way you you need to index \nlike encode \ntext as vector is different from \nencoding \ncode or images as vectors \nyeah \ni'm curious if you think this idea as \nwell say we have these um so we have the \nwe vva general slack where we see a lot \nof these questions about specific things \nand \nsay we want to have like a class that is \num slack conversations and then we have \nanother class is the um the vva \ndocumentation or maybe like a code \ntutorial that would like walk you \nthrough an example of how to use it and \nthen you maybe link link it that way so \nit's like \nslot conversation \nuh most relevant to \ndocumentation that kind of way of \nbreaking down the data and then \ni guess like then thinking about how the \nhow you can kind of apply the relational \nfilters through it \ndoes that kind of thing make sense as a \nway to use the data model \num \nyeah definitely so you could use the \nquestions that are posted in slack \nchannel or on stack overflow \nas \nuh yeah as \npart of your data model of course so you \ncan like link those questions with the \nactual content where the answer is \ncan be found in \nyeah \nyes yeah i think that whole thing is \nreally interesting the all the different \nparts of the vba model and then the user \nexperience design how the graphql lets \nyou access these things i think all that \nis just really interesting so kind of um \nstepping out into more of a meta topic \nyou've been an avid conference speaker \ncan can you tell me about like what goes \ninto \nuh sort of \nyour \npreparation uh the the whole the whole \nkind of experience i guess is something \ni'm curious about is someone who's like \nkind of interested in doing this kind of \nthing as well and like you've traveled \nall over europe and in new york and so \nlike what is that experience been \nyeah yeah it's been really great so i'm \nreally happy that we can travel again \nlike after all the the go with \nrestrictions so actually i just started \nto travel since this year before that i \ndid like a lot of \nmeet-ups and conference presentations \nand like workshops online but i think \nthis whole \nthing of being in person and being able \nto actually talk with people see their \nresponses like answer their questions \nand learn about like their interest and \nmotivation \nthat adds so much value to um to \nwhatever you're doing i think \nso i think like um yeah i get really \nexcited to to speak in front of these \npeople \nand explain them a really new concept um \nand then \nlike seeing their reaction okay this \ncould actually be something that i can \nbe using \nuh and then talking about like possible \nuse cases and so on \num \nyeah in terms of preparation so \num usually i'm doing like introduction \ntalks to vector search so what is vector \nsearch \num because this is a relatively new \nconcept for most of the people \nso um yeah in that case i have like um \nsome slice ready and then i adjust like \njust like the slides to to the \nconference i'm speaking at \num to make it like fitting with the \naudience etc \nand um \nyeah i also sometimes give workshops and \nthen i have like \na bison jupiter notebook \nready to to share with the audience that \nthey can actually build their own \nvector search application within the \nhour basically so \nyeah that's just super exciting to do \nyeah \nlet me ask a quick question on which one \ndo you prefer between \nthe overview or the hands-on workshop \nkind of thing \noh that's a hard question \num \nyeah i think the the workshop because i \nthere i also start with uh like a small \npresentation because i want first people \nto know what they're actually gonna do \num but then \nto see the excitement of people that \nthey like do their first \nneural search basically their first \nsemantic search \nand then like seeing the possibilities \nthat it opens for them it's just yeah \nthat's really cool \nyeah and i think that it comes back to \nthe kind of hopefully there's a \nconsistent theme i know we're going \naround the ebay topics but that user \nexperience and i think there was \ni remember reading a techcrunch article \nuh with bob where it's like um it's like \nbob put their articles into techcrunch \nand then showed them how to do the \nqueries right and because that graphql \ndesign it's so like you get it right \naway when you start like using the near \ntext and i think that really ties the \nwhole thing together with the \nuser experience to putting on the \nworkshop to people saying like oh i get \nwhat this is right and that whole kind \nof flow of it \nyeah yeah i think that's a really \nimportant uh topic so um \nif you are using especially a new \ntechnology like some like new \nyeah new technology new database \nyou don't want to be \nheld back by \num yeah a difficult uh way of querying \nit by \nfor example so \nthe query language uh is like the api is \nthe main interface for people \nso that that is the first thing that we \nneed to like just like the documentation \nis we really need to have that uh \nintuitive and as simple as possible \nand \nwe also so that also um \nso we v8 has client libraries like in \npython java go \n[Music] \njavascript \num \nso that you can use vvate easily within \nyour own applications \nand of course like the team like stefan \nand martin are working on that so that's \nalso part of the whole developer \nexperience basically that we want to \nhave as high as possible \nyeah and i also think that um that semi \nconsole that lets you uh connect to the \nwebv8 instance and then do the graphql \nqueries without even uh writing python \ncode or what and even in the python code \ni think it's you it's the same thing \nright where you just have like the three \nuh quotations string bracket and then \nyou just paste in that same graphql but \nyeah the the console thing i think that \nis like a beautiful user interface for \nuh for getting started with it also \nyeah exactly yeah and also um \nso now that the community is growing we \nalso see that people work like people \nstart to contribute to eve but also \ncontribute to \nexamples or like uh some demo projects \nthat are made with vva \nso we see people that made like \na really simple user interface for \nquerying \nimages for example in a multi-modal way \nor a really intuitive user interface for \ndoing it in text or \nhaving a movie recommender \nor search engine and i think like if you \nstart to abbreviate and you look at this \nrepository of examples it's really easy \nto get started and that's what really \nexcites me \nyeah i mean i think that's such an \ninteresting uh part of what we're trying \nto do with our next like you know few \nmonths of doing this is like how quickly \ncan people learn webv8 how quickly can \nthey get their data and how quickly can \nthey understand how to query it and yeah \nso i think also just the whole thing \nabout content getting people to dispute \nwith webview and i think this is like \nsuch a great uh coverage of topics and i \nthink from everything from the \nunderstanding of the graphql the user \nexperience hearing your story of the \ntime that we've ate and um \ndesign of modules extending it with \nother plugins like haystack gina hugging \nface open ai and how this whole thing \nfits together i think this is a great \noverview so thank you so much laura for \nuh for coming on the wii va podcast and \nexplaining these things \nthank you connor for having me that's \ngreat \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Laura Ham on Weaviate User Experience - Weaviate
