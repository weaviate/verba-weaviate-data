{"text": "Product from Juraj: https://www.labelator.io Spark connector project: ... \nforeign \n[Music] \nepisode of viviate air I'm really \nexcited to have you all here like you \nsee we are already waving to you because \nlike everyone is super excited about \nthis new episode and it's it's a nice \none because like we're kicking off in \nthe new year so we are all super excited \nabout it uh so you should be really nice \nand fun so thank you for watching and \nthank you for listening whether you live \nor you're watching the video later uh \nI'm absolutely pumped to see every \nsingle one of you here \num so because this is live please ask us \nquestions as we go right like I will if \nif I see any questions popping up like I \nwill go and share them with uh like the \naudience here and then potentially we'll \nelect the best person to answer the \nquestion hopefully it won't be me but \nhey you never know \num so for today I thought that maybe we \ncould give you a quick uh update in \nterms of what should you expect from \nthis episode right so first up we'll \nhave our special guest URI who will talk \nto you about uh label later which is a \nproduct that he built with weaviate uh \nso I'm really excited about actually \nlearning that what he's built how does \nit work and uh euri promised me that \nthere will be a demo so how cool is that \nuh then later on we'll have Etienne uh \nour our CTO who will come and talk to \nyou about the Outlook of vv8 for 2023 so \nbasically what you may expect of like \nwhat kind of things can you expect to \nhappen around vv8 it's not necessarily A \nroadmap itself but it's close enough \nlike this is kind of like the direction \nthe general idea and now let him talk \nabout it more uh then Zen we'll talk \nabout the spark connector \nfor vv8 we've had like a couple of blog \nposts around it uh but um but Zen really \nwanted to also do like a quick demo and \nthen show you off uh how everything \nworks so this is super exciting uh Conor \nwill talk about the beer benchmarks in \nviviate and I'm so proud of myself that \nI spelled beer correctly but I think um \nyou know for those of you for for for \nyou that beer is normal you probably \ncringe at me but hey I'll take that uh \nand then Erica will talk about uh some \nCommunity questions because uh we do \nreceive a whole bunch of questions uh on \non the community slack on and we tend to \nalways help and and answer them and then \nsome of them they're worth highlighting \nuh so Erica will highlight three \nquestions three uh and then she'll go \nover them and that'll be cool and then \nat the end if you have enough patience \nto stick with it and then wait until the \nend I like to actually show you a \npreview of our new new website so like \nthere will be a huge update to the new \ndocument to the documentation for the \nreview documentation and in general will \nbe changing quite a bit around the Vivid \nIO website \num so yeah this is basically the plan \nfor uh this session uh so without any \nfurther Ado I want to pass on the button \nto your our special guest who talked to \nus about the label later hey you're \nright welcome to uh Vivid air I'm so \nhappy you're here \nhi thank you so much for having me yeah \nand thank you for the opportunity to \nshow what I've built with uh vv8 uh I I \nmust say like uh it was a really long \njourney uh until I got there but uh \nPleasant one so thank you so much uh for \nhelping me even like with with uh \nbuilding in and solving my problems so \nit was cool yeah absolutely to be honest \nthis is like a two-way street because \nlike uh I always loved like this was one \nof my first interactions when I joined \nthe we data when I joined the company \nand the community and like I could see \nyou asking a lot of questions but you \nalso answer a lot of questions so I'm \nsuper pumped to have you here and then \nnow showing you like hey where is this \nall coming from yeah yeah uh yeah why \nnot help when you know the answer you \nknow \nalways are happy to help okay so maybe \nyou can share my screen and I'll \ndescribe let's do that I'm building on \non the fly so this is laborator uh \nbasically what is laborator the \nlaboratory is a tool where you can uh \nfine tune and build your own uh NLP \nmodels so usually how how you work as a \ndata scientist you have a data set uh \nthat you probably you didn't vibrate \nbecause it's kind of at work and then \nyou you build a model and deploy it and \ndo all the the engineering stuff and \nyeah it's cool but if you want to build \nsomething that is uh kind of unique you \nneed to have a unique data set \nuh and to label these data it is \nproblematic and uh I was facing this \nproblem I was trying to build something \nuh something special which I couldn't \nfind a proper data set for and like \nusing the uh common uh annotating tools \nuh wasn't really uh working for me \nbecause I was getting crazy after after \na while so uh I bought this uh it \nevolved from something else but \num it's it's kind of cool so I'll show \nit to you \num what we have here is uh like projects \nprojects uh uh basically like imagine \nlike a data set but combined with models \nand other stuff \nso uh if you have a project then you can \njust \npick the project you wanna you wanna \nopen \nand let's see this one for example \nand you are immediately like through \ninto like documents uh but let's start \nfrom beginning I will do it if you'd be \nlike uh trying to this product for first \ntime you just create a new project let's \nsay we want to do some I don't know \ncomment moderation that's a use case \nthat uh our customers are are using too \nso let's call it like comments \nfirst \num and we might have some data or we \nmight not that's also a common problem \nit's kind of a chicken problem that if \nyou uh want to build a product that is \nuh \num that is really unique and you don't \nhave map you might not have a a demo \ndata to train the model and you won't \nget it and you'll have it of your first \ncustomer so let's imagine that you have \na problem you that you feel that you can \nbuild it with you can solve it with \ndimensional learning with AI \nuh but you don't have the data the real \ndata that you you could change them all \nalong but let's imagine that we have \nsome data but they are not labeled so \nI'll just choose this this CSV file with \nwith some comments downloaded from the \ninternet \nand yeah I can choose like the mesh \nlearning task that I want to solve so \nlet's go this time for this \nclassification and this is where the vb8 \nuh is coming in uh so when we import the \ndata they will be imported with the \nvectors and you can choose like which \nmodel you want to start with so if you \nhave English data you can choose one of \nthese and you have if you have a \ndifferent language you can pick uh this \nmultilingual model that is pretty good \nbut we have English this time you can \nchoose any model from a hugging face Hub \nthat's that's cool so you can just find \nyour own uh domain specific model that \nyou want to like fine tune and and \nevaluate further \nhere we can Define our labels so let's \nsay comments can be positive \nnegative \nand I don't know maybe toxic uh toxic \nthat we want to hide and now if I save \nit uh the data will start to import into \nvb8 \nyeah it might take a while but we don't \nneed to wait for it so I just hope the \ntwo projects that this already has been \nlabeled \nuh \nso actually I I to be honest I labeled \nthis uh just part of the project that \njust half ago half an hour ago before \nthis this presentation just to test it \nif everything is working so I labeled in \nhalf an hour like uh 600 uh it's almost \n700 comments and what is really cool and \nwhat really really it is enabling me uh \nas I'm scrolling I'm immediately being \nshown like okay there is a comment there \nis like document and how many similar \ndocuments are already in the database \nand if this document has some some \nlabels some some class uh it's very \nlikely that the most similar ones will \nhave the same label so in this way maybe \nnot this one but uh in this this way we \ncan like label all the documents at once \nso with one click I let's label 12 \ndocuments if I will go uh here I can see \nlike more documents uh this is like more \nthan an exploratory mode but if I'll go \nto backlog I'll be showing just the \ndocuments that are not labeled yet \nand for example for example here is like \n60 similar documents so that's like low \nHenry for hanging fruit so I can label \nlots of documents or Advance yes they \nare similar but like even this can help \nuh to have the model more similar \nexamples to strengthen the the \num the learning \nso I just labeled 60 documents with with \none click so this is the first part \nwhere we really we read is how pink uh \nme to to uh label more data more quickly \nuh \nuh then I can skip to this micro topics \npart which is more like an exploratory \nmode where uh as the data were imported \nuh there was also like topic modeling uh \ngoing uh underneath it and like the \nbubbles are basically a clusters of very \nsimilar uh documents that are similar by \ntopic so it doesn't necessarily mean \nthat if you are similar by topic they \nhave the same label but it also can help \nme if even if they have different label \nuh to label them because I will have \nlike different versions for the same \nlabel uh and again this will help the \nthe training \nokay uh if I label like enough data I \ndon't need to label everything I'll just \ngo here models and I can train a new \nmodel so this is like really easy easy \nUI I can set up some Advanced features \nand uh Advanced uh settings but I don't \nneed to I just click train a new model \nit will take few minutes to to train so \nwe don't need to wait for it but yeah \nwhen it's trained you can see like all \nthe evaluation parameters confusion \nmetrics and so on uh I could even \ncompare like this version of the model \nto previous model for example so I can \nsee like okay this version is five \npercent uh was on this a particular uh \npart of the data set uh but here we are \nbetter because uh he was like two \npercent were were mispredicted uh and \nnow it's now with zero so I can even \nlike click uh if I see like here are \nsome like here are some documents that \nare not correctly predicted I can click \ninto in this box and in a new tab I will \nsee like okay uh there is this the \ndocument and it was labeled negative but \nit's predicted positive so that's \nprobably not good and like we can \nevaluate by it so uh and this seems to \nbe like mislabel document so I just \nmight fix it and uh retrain the model or \nnot that doesn't really matter \nuh yeah and if I will go through all of \nthese I just want to deploy the model \ninto production so that's another thing \nthat you can do right here just create a \nnew node that is basically spun UPS a \nvirtual machine in the cloud or you can \nselect like self-hosted machine that \nmeans that you will deploy a Docker \ncontainer and the container you don't \nneed to do almost anything it's just \nlike single Docker run command and every \nsetup is uh being done here so when the \nnode is is created I can just uh Define \nwhich model I want to deploy the pro \nhere so I can just choose from which \nproject and which model I want to deploy \nI already have this ready so this is my \nmy latest model \nand yeah if I do this I can just test it \nuh cool so \nmy first thing that I will usually do is \nlike write best \nand the thing is that uh lots of times \nwhen I when I tried this with uh models \nthat were trained on on devil data that \ndata set \nI got this like prediction that was \ncompletely off this time it was probably \nright because I have this class natural \nbut if I try this with for example \nagnews data set where you have this word \nscience and technology then the \nprediction will be I don't know maybe \nscience or world but just like not true \nbecause there is not such a class for it \nbut these models are very often uh like \ninclined to give you an answer and \nthat's a problem that I was also trying \nto solve uh and there's another another \nvery cool feature that was enabled by \nbb8 \nso you can Define these routing rules \nand for every incoming like prompt you \ncan Define uh it that it will be \ncompared with all the data that the \nmodel was trained on \nand you can Define if the similarity to \nthe data that the model was trained on \nis up to 80 percent 80 to 100 then like \nokay we can be confident enough that uh \nthe AI the model will give you the right \nanswer but but if it's off if it's for \nexample in the range of uh 50 to 100 \npercent \nthen I'm not that sure and I want to \nreview the data so actually if you \nprompt the model the node it will create \na new document in in the project so it \nwill import data into vb8 and you can \nreview the predictions and you can \nimprove uh with time your model \non the data that were not previously \npresent in the data set so you don't \nneed to collect all the data and like \nthen figure out like which we should uh \nhandle it's going on the Fly and you can \nbasically continuously learn and improve \nyour model uh and there is this last \nthing that is called manual \nyou can Define like okay manual means \nthe model and the AI doesn't know so if \nit doesn't meet any of these routing \nrules it means that it's so D so uh \ndifferent than anything that the model \nuh have seen before that we don't want \nto give you an answer and that's then \nyou can connect it with webhooks and \nwhen you actually uh correct the data or \nlabel the data in in the project uh it \nwill be sent to your core product and \nlike uh it will give you the answer like \nasynchronously \nuh there are also a bunch of other \nthings you can compare it with your uh \nwith your examples that is also very \ncool uh which you can help it can really \nhelp you to uh \nuh fix the data in the Productions \nsometimes if your model is uh is working \nis in a production and you will figure \nout for example I will give you a \nexample what happened to us we deployed \nthis into production for uh big news \nmedia company in Slovakia and uh first \nwhat we figured that the model was \ntrained it had great metrics but we've \nwe figured that uh when there were like \nthree emojis concept one emojis it was \ngiving us the same uh label which was \nlike this is uh this is uh something \nthat is toxic \nit was before we had lots of data with \nthis throwing up emojis uh in the data \nset and so it was like predetermined to \ndo this and if you would would like to \nfix it you would need to uh go over the \ndata retrain the mobile but I could just \nlike create a example uh with three \nthrowing up emojis or I can just example \nlike uh \nPro up uh and then you can Define the \nsimilarity to this example or more \nexamples whatever \nand then you can decide if the \nprediction is something you wanna go \nwith manual so you don't under the model \nto determine because you know that the \nmodel is not working with this uh \nspecific area of the embedding space uh \npretty well \nyes so that was a quick quick uh demo of \nwhat I've built \nuh I'm happy to answer any of your \nquestions if you have some \nthat's really cool like and uh not even \nmy words like Laura was like hey yeah \nthis is pretty amazing uh to see that \num I think maybe we could leave it for \nfor like towards the end or something \nlike hey everybody knows where to find \nyou right uh conscious of time uh like \nbut if you have questions or something \nyou want to chat more about like some of \nthe cool things how he did that like hey \nlet's open up the conversation Let's uh \nlet's talk on slack and that'll be \npretty amazing but yeah you're right \nthank you for this demo was really \namazing that uh it's kind of like an eye \nopener it's like oh the kind of cool \nthings you can deal with it amazing \nthanks yeah it's really one of those \nthose things where if you built such a \nversatile platform such as vv8 like you \nsee some kind of use cases that that you \nexpect but you also know that it's much \nmore than a specific use case and then \nseeing something like that which is so \nfar beyond of sort of what we do in on a \ndaily basis that's so cool so inspiring \nI really really love this thing I I \nreally like the sort of hybrid approach \nof fully automatic fully manual and \nsomething in between this reminds me of \nthe software that I used to uh to do my \ntaxes with which is kind of similar like \nyou can't just trust an AI to do your \ntaxes because if it messes up like the \nconsequences are are massive but if it \ncan suggest something for you and you \ncan just say yes or no you still saved a \nlot of times I really like this this \naugmented kind of exactly and it really \nviviate is is uh something that we \nabbreviated this wouldn't be possible \nbecause if I would uh through if I \nshould go for through all the data set \nand compare the incoming data with with \nany of the data that the model was \ntrained on it wouldn't be possible but \nwe deviate I can like do it and it's \nstill I can work pretty fast \nsuper cool then let me let me give you \nan Outlook of what else to expect in \nmediate in the coming year and uh \nstarting first with uh the word Outlook \nso we were thinking what should we call \nthis is this a roadmap is this the the \nOutlook \num what are we what are we um sort of \nshowing here and we decided on Outlook \nbecause we do have a roadmap and the \nroadmap is very precise for what's \ncoming next or the next step and it gets \na bit less precise for one after that \nand if we're looking at entire year it \ngets pretty fuzzy and that is on purpose \nbecause we want to be uh fast to react \nto to customer demand user demand \nCommunity demand to see basically what \nis the features that you need but at the \nsame time we want to give you an Outlook \nof what to expect to to come this year \nso um this is why we have the the 2023 \noutlook here and still of course we will \nhave our roadmap so if you look at the \nroadmap you will see the next release \nthat comes up has some things that \nbasically overlap with this Outlook and \nthe Outlook is kind of what to expect by \nthe end of the Year this Outlook is made \nup of six specific pillars the first one \nis retrieval and ingestion pipelines so \num an example for for this kind of \ncategory would be a request that now \nthat we have the hybrid search API \num one of the first requests that came \nin is like cool can I use this with q a \nand the answer is yes soon because right \nnow you can't do it yet because \ntraditionally basically the the Q a was \nsort of an implicit pipeline of a \nnear-text search and then an answer \nextraction and we want to open this up \nwe want to make this more flexible so in \nthis this sort of Epic of pipelining the \nidea is that the user can just decide \nwhat to pipeline yes there may be \npredefined pipelines but you can also \ncustomize it and this could go further \nthis could also go for ingestion for \nexample so a recent feature request was \nfor PDF extraction so we do have a PDF \nextract the text from the PDF then do a \ntext to VEC so you have a two-step sort \nof ingestion pipeline anything being \nrelated to to bm25 and hybrid search \nwould also be in this bucket \nthen coming to the second bucket which \nis currently called Beyond billion \nscales so this is also super super \nimportant one to me uh last year was the \nfirst year that we had a billion scale \ndata set in V8 and that was sort of the \nbig milestone to to be able to achieve \nthat that uh that scale but it doesn't \nstop there we want to continue and we \nwant to make it better and especially a \nbig portion of that is for example \nfilters so filters is something that \nmakes bb-8 unique and and powers and I \nguess in the use cases that we just saw \nfrom from Europe I'm sure there's lots \nof filtering going on there and um \nfiltering gets more and more sort of \nexpensive from a computational respect \nperspective as the data set grows and \nthere we have we have big plans so we'll \nannounce something soon to make filters \nway way faster at the billion scale and \nthis is one of the examples but \nbasically uh we want VBA to be even \nbetter at the very large scale \num that brings me to the third pillar \nwhich also has scale in the name which \nis the improved Cloud operations and \nscaling so \num big milestone reached at the end of \nthe year in in 2022 which was the \nintroduction of replication which is the \nthe sort of biggest part of that cloud \noperations \num roadmap and um it's it's sort of done \nin a way that it doesn't stop not \nbecause it's incomplete because but \nbecause we can always add more to it \nalways improve it so for example one \nthing that we put out there um that that \nour architecture would enable us to do \nwould be active active multi-dc kind of \nreplication so you would replicate your \ndata set across the world in different \ndata centers if a whole data center goes \ndown doesn't matter because you have the \nredundancy with the other Data Center \nand you have that sort of proximity to \nthe user kind of thing \num and and we put that out there and \nthere was a lot of positive feedback \nalready which is nice so this gives us \ngives us a good indication of what you \nas the users want and um gives us plenty \nof cool stuff to build in this bucket \nall also of course any other kind of \nkind of operations tooling so for \nexample we introduced this node API \nwhich was a sort of relatively small \ninternal request from our internal \nsolution engineering team but that has \nhelped a lot and helped in debugging and \nthese kind of kind of tools that are \ncheap to build but have this big kind of \nimpact they will all be in this bucket \nor in this pillar then the next one the \nfourth pillar is something that's \nbasically completely new in this year \nbecause we've been researching in the \nbackground and research is something \nthat that takes some time and this year \nwe will release not one but two new \nVector index types so you know sort of \nvv8 has been going hand in hand with \nhnsw for quite a while but um now you \nwill get more options the first one is \nonly so to speak an extension to hnsw \nwhere we introduce compression so you \nstill use an hsw index but your vectors \nare compressed and that reduces your \nmemory footprint so that's sort of a \na very quick way to to lower your memory \nusage and then the next one which will \nbe later this year is a fully disk based \nsolution so we also teased that a bit um \nfrom our from our Italy trip last year \nin November \num where we showed some some uh \nobservability graphs with the memory uh \ngoing down quite a bit and this is \num yeah this will be production ready \nwithin this year and of course there \nwill be previews um and experimental \nreleases so you can start playing around \nwith it way way sooner than that \nthe fifth bucket is clients and modules \nso this is \num basically this is this could almost \nfill an entire BBN episode on its own \nthis particular packet um but what we \nhave in there is everything to do with \nthe module system so for example \nre-ranking with cross encoders that's \nthat's the part that also fits in the \nfirst bucket the um the search and \ningestion pipelines \num but if you have such a module or Sr \nif you have such a model in the pipeline \nto to re-rank it needs to come from \nsomewhere and that's our module system \num generative search that's sort of the \nworking title for for I see Conor \nsmiling and he can he can share way more \nabout this than than I can but it's an \narea that we're looking into and that \nwould have some some cool stuff about it \num similar for for the client's \ningestion pipelines \num also something that we have in this \nepisode even the the vb8 spark connector \nso plenty more in that category to to \nimprove ingestion ingestion speed \ningestion resilience these kind of \ntopics which all also sort of fits in \nvery nicely with the the replication \nMilestone so if the client side is \nresilient and now the server side is \nresolient then basically that means \nanything can happen and you will still \nsucceed with your import which is super \ncool and the sixth one is probably the \nmost important pillar which is the one \nthat has the most open the most \nGreenfield kind of area is our community \nso you know our community roadmap which \ngives you \num a chance to participate in our \nprioritization we have this this upvote \nfeature which is \nso cool to see for us to to see sort of \nokay if if someone creates a feature \nrequest is this sort of an edge case \nthat just a single user wants or is this \nsomething that there is a lot of demand \nfor and then if something suddenly pops \nup with like 20 uploads then you know \nwow okay this is cool and this makes it \nvery easy for us to to uh say like yeah \nlet's focus our energy on that and it \nalso makes it a bit easier to because \nthere's only so many things that we can \nfocus on at the same time it also makes \nit a bit easier to say this is why we're \nnot focusing on this particular feature \nright now because look at this there's a \nlot of demand for for this one and um \nyeah super super happy that we have this \nroadmap and please keep submitting your \nyour feature requests please keep \nupvoting your feature requests and \nplease keep this as the third one that I \nfind super cool keep advocating for the \nfeatures that you want so we have \nCommunity users say like hey there's \nthis feature request this is super \nimportant feature \num if you think so too please upload for \nit and it led to it to a spiking like \nfive upvotes which to me me is a super \ngreat sign that we have a really good \nsort of community involvement and really \nare building the kind of things that all \nof you out there actually need \nyeah thank you that's that's it for me \nfrom the the sort of sneak peek into the \nOutlook of course we will publish that \num that's sort of why I'm not sharing \nanything other than just talking because \nit's currently uh under development will \nmake it pretty \num the content is already pretty but we \nalso make the the presentation pretty \nand then we'll publish this very soon \nI like the promise that the the one of \nthe big features about the roadmo is \nthat it's going to be pretty uh no but \nthis is really exciting like it's like \num I've been with the company for like \nsix months and so much changed and now \nyou're talking about all these pillars \nuh and then like it shows us that like \nwe have a very good idea of what we want \nto achieve and yet in all of this the P \nthere is a big pillar for Community uh \nfor great people like you right here \nright like say if there's something that \nwe can do to make you more successful so \nthat weave it can you know run faster or \ncan perform a specific task let us know \nand then share it with us and talk to us \nbecause we do listen we do listen and we \nrespond to that so I'm really glad that \nIan that you made it like make a point \nabout it it's yeah \nit's um it's community that makes it all \ntick I have to say yeah and it's really \nthat that bi-directional kind of thing \nlike we're we're helping users like like \nyou're right you'll be the example for \nevery Community you're here today \nbecause you're you're in the call \num yeah we help the users like you but \nwe also get so much back from you like \nyou and that for for this you are \nactually a perfect example because so \nmany times you've helped us debug some \nissues or maybe find something out that \nthat um potentially could have been a \nbigger issue if we hadn't caught it soon \nenough thanks to you and of course we we \ndo have our own uh QA engineering but \nsometimes sometimes something slips \nthrough and to get that kind of help and \nand um yeah really sort of helping each \nother not just saying like throwing it \nover the fence and saying okay this is \nthere's a buck fix it but sort of \nhelping each other going back and forth \nhave these kind of kind of conversation \nthat is such such a valuable thing about \nthis this um yeah open source also for \nus not because it's it's not one-sided \nright like open source doesn't just mean \nthat everyone gets to use it for free \nthere's there's also plenty benefits \nthat we get from \nyeah I must say that this is something \nthat really distinguish viviate from \nfrom other tools that I've used like uh \nthis this cooperation is really awesome \nwith you guys \nthank you so much \nI will say really quick um when I was \ngoing to the community questions I saw \nand I believe also from the community \ncalled urai the Ruby encyclopedia you \nsee it's just a lot of questions \nyeah \nevents yeah nice \nspeaking of those uh yeah sorry go ahead \nSebastian no no go for it speaking about \nuh Community collaboration and us \nhelping the community the community \nhelping us back I guess that's a really \ngood segue into the next topic because \num as Etienne mentioned the the spark \nconnector was developed by the community \num shout out to Sam stalinga Sam Bean we \nhad a podcast with him this is another \nexample of uh of where the community the \nthe friends at you.com we're using we V8 \nand they were also using spark uh to uh \nto develop their ETL pipelines and they \nwanted to be able to take that data and \nthen populate uh deviate with it and um \nif he had mentioned that uh billion \nscale solution we actually used this was \none of the ingredients that went into \nthat uh that solution \nand I just wanted to talk a little bit \nabout that give you a small demo and \nthere's a blog posts and podcasts that \nwe've also published around this as well \num just imagine if you could share my \nscreen here yeah absolutely so let's \nshare your screen thank you \num awesome so the Wi-Fi spark connector \nthe concept behind this is uh pretty \nstraightforward the idea is that if you \nhave unstructured data uh natural \nlanguage data image data and you're \nworking with it in spark and this is \ncritical if you're working with a a data \nset that's uh of any consequential size \num when you're getting into the billions \nobviously but you're going to be working \nin spark whether it's to do ETL you can \neven train models within spark if you're \njust visualizing your data you're going \nto be working with a distributed \nframework like spark the main idea \nbehind the spark the weeviate spark \nconnector is that you can easily \ntake your data data structures within \nspark and then use those to populate uh \nyour weeviate database using using the \ndata it's already imported into Spark \nand you can specify the batch size you \ncan specify the URL for the weeviate \nhost and if you have vectorized data you \ncan even pass that in as a column that's \nin your that's in your data frame \nand this obviously helps with the uh \nwith the speed of ingestion as well \nI wanted to show you a quick demo as \nwell here \nso here I've got uh \nI've got this notebook let me let me see \nif I can zoom in a little bit here \nfurther \nso in order to get this running you'll \nneed Pi spark you'll need the alleviate \npython client and then you can have your \ndata ready either on Google Drive or for \nthis example I've got it ready on disk \nand really a lot of this is just Pi \nspark functionality so you can import Pi \nspark and then you can start a a spark \nsession I'm just showing this locally \nbut usually this would be uh this would \nbe on the cloud \nso I'm going to start a spark session \nhere \nso that's getting started and then once \nthat's up you can you can view it you \ncan also use the spark UI to oops let me \nopen it \nso you can use the spark UI to to look \nat what's going on in the background as \nwell \nand then \nthe the next step is to get your data \nI'm going to import it from a Json file \nbut you can import it from a parquet \nfile as well many other formats in which \nyou can import it and I'm going to put \nit into a \na panda's uh spark pandas data frame \nand this is very similar to the code \nthat we actually used for the one \nbillion import actually here I'm just \nshowing you an example of a hundred \nthousand uh data points from the sphere \ndata set \nbut we actually use this very code \nfor that for that job \nso once that data is in the spark data \nframe you can see what that looks like \nthe cool thing about the sphere data set \nis that not only do you have the um the \nthe Snippets \nfor news articles but you also have the \nvectorized representation of those \narticles \nso we're going to use this actually to \npopulate alleviate as well \nso the next step once your data is in \nspark you can then write it to vva and \nthis is the novel component where the \nspark connector comes in right \nso I've got a alleviate instance up and \nrunning locally and then I'm going to \ncreate a schema that I'm going to use \nand then this is where the spark \nconnector comes in we'll post a link \nthat will that will that you can go to \nto look at the code behind this as well \nbut the main idea here is that you can \ntake your spark data frame your data \nstructure and you can directly populate \nwe V8 using that data structure and here \nyou have the ability to control for \nbatch size you can tell it where the \nhost is located this one this option is \ninteresting here so this actually \nspecifies the name of the column that \nstores the vectorized representations \nfor every row so if I scroll back up \nhere you can see that the vector column \nhere has the vectorized representations \nthis is how we populate not just the uh \nnot just the natural language data but \nalso the vectorized representations into \ninto eviate \nso we can run that \nand all of this by the way you can you \ncan have a look at the spark UI all of \nthis executes uh starts and executes a \njob on the back end \nthere it is so all of this is uh \nstarting and executing a job on the back \nend so you can monitor that as well and \nthen once you have data in leviate then \nyou can just you can you can query that \ndata as you would so you can query the \ntitles for example you can also look at \nthe urls \num before this there wasn't an easy way \nto get data from a spark data structure \nand to eviate and this uh this really \nhelps with that process so I just wanted \nto talk a little bit about this if \nyou're more interested in the details \nhere we've got multiple blog posts \naround this and then we've also got the \npodcast with uh one of the creators of \nthis Sam bean from you.com and then the \nother one being Sam's delinga \namazing uh so we actually already shared \nsome of the links uh of the things that \nwe talk about in a description or that \nwe will talk about and I think I'd be \nworth adding uh the links to the podcast \nthat you mentioned then and I know \nConnor you did another one recently as \nwell so I would definitely add those so \nlike uh later on check out the \ndescription and the links will be there \nunfortunately YouTube doesn't allow us \nto share links directly as comments uh \nbut we will definitely add that in the \ndescription \nhey Zen uh this this was pretty uh \npretty amazing like I I like how simple \nit felt like you were like oh my data \nsource here here's my structure just \nprovide the options boom and then we had \nthis separate interface to just you \ncould watch as the data gets imported \nuh it's it's mind-blowing yeah exactly \nand anybody any any data scientist any \napplication that you're working even on \nthe million uh million scale 10 million \nscale you're going to be using a \ndistributed framework like this and to \nhave a connector that allows you to \npopulate uh alleviate with that same \ndata is just very convenient \nyeah amazing amazing \ncool thanks for this presentation so \nnext up uh we have Connor \ncan you share the screen as well \noh yeah let me do that uh where are you \nhere \nsuper cool so I'm so excited to be \nfollowing Zane on this and talking about \nuh the spark connector and the Big Data \nuploads and how this relates to the Beer \nBenchmark so firstly here comes my \nSebastian calls it Shameless plug uh \nwe're just publishing our podcast with \nNils rhymers uh nose rhymers is one of \nthe creators of the beer benchmarks it's \nbeen incredible working with the cohere \nteam on uh publishing this scheduling it \nwith the podcast and everything with the \nintegration with bb8 so please check out \ncheck that out it'll be super cool so \nI'm so excited to tell you about the we \ngave your benchmarks and our efforts in \nputting the beer benchmarks into Eva and \nsort of why we've done this and why it's \nimportant so oh sorry so let's start off \nwith you know why is this important so \nwe begin with sort of two questions for \nwhy do we want to add the beer \nbenchmarks to eviate the first question \nis well how do we know that hybrid \nsearch is better than either dense \nVector search or bm25 on their own and \nthe beer benchmarks presents a set of \ntests where we can tell you that here's \na performance of dense Vector search \nhere's a performance of bm75 hybrid \nsearches \non the data set and then the second \nquestion that's very important is how do \nwe VA users know that hybrid search has \nbeen implemented correctly in webiate so \nstart off with what are the beer \nbenchmarks beer benchmarks emphasize \ndiversity so let's say You're Building A \nnutrition facts search app Financial \nquestion search app or you're searching \nthrough tweets it contains this kind of \ndiversity of domain it's like esoteric \nstyle of query like the twit the tweets \nor things like this so you have this \nkind of diversity and that's sort of the \ncore goal of what's captured in the beer \ndata sets so another very important \ndetail is the size of the data set so \nyou see on the this 3D plot I think I've \nbeen kind of animating it in 3D adds a \nnice Dimension to the visualization but \nyou see the um the MS Marco data set is \nthe big data set with 10 million uh you \nknow down to Natural questions is 2.6 \nand then you know you have Cora cqa dupe \nstack these are the ones say so NF \nCorpus is about three and a half \nthousand so you can you know experiment \nwith it really quickly \nso a lot of these data sets are very \ninteresting when you dig into the \nqueries and the nuances of each of them \nbut again the the core thing is \ncapturing diversity so NF Corpus \nnutrition facts arguana are counter \narguments where you're searching for uh \ndisagreements to some claim which has \nall sorts of interesting implications to \nit FICA Financial questions try covid \nscientific papers about covid cqa dupe \nstack is like stack Overflow coding \nquestions Cora you're looking for \nduplicate questions uh you know fever is \nfact verification Ms Marco is the Bing \nweb search API so very interesting \ndiversity and that's the goal of the \nbeer benchmarks so now let's talk about \nadding it to Evie so there's five steps \nthat we're going to look at how you \ndownload the data they've provided these \nexcellent links that you can just you \nknow W get and you have data vectorizing \nuploading to ev8 backups backups being \nthe big thing here and then test \nso starting off you just uh they've met \nthey've made these super easy to \ndownload so you just kind of go to this \nlink and then you click the link and you \nhave the data \nso now let's talk about vectorizing so \nwhat I did with vectorizing is I'm \nrunning this on the Google collab T4 GPU \nI thought the T4 might be a little more \naccessible for clocking the times in the \na100 \nso you can see how long it takes to \nvectorize and I think kind of having \nthis data table is is useful for people \nto understand like how long does it take \nto vectorize Big Data \nso I think maybe the most useful nugget \nis to see like 500 000 takes about an \nhour so you know whatever you're \nthinking about that's kind of a good way \nof thinking about it so then think about \nvectorizing larger scale data sets so \nwe've done the natural questions and so \nwhat I've done is I have the Json file \nwhere you load the entire Json file and \nthen you chunk it up once you have the \nJson file and so so you can do that and \nyou vectorize each of the chunks but the \nkey thing with parquet is parquet and \nSpark as Zane is mentioning that it has \na better way of how you uh take just a \nslice of the data set to chunk it so \nwhen we're publishing the full blog post \nwe're going to switch from the Json file \nto the parquet for the larger scale \nvectorizations \nso the next step is importing alleviate \nand so uh with the new uh batch enforce \nthis is just insanely faster so the uh \nlike I originally started doing this one \nby one and then the new python client \nwith the uh batch Imports and dirt cool \nlike what he's done with that is just so \nmuch faster and it's really exciting to \ndo it so so these are kind of some of \nthe times that we're seeing with \nimporting to deviate you can see the the \ndifferences you see with like the \ndifference between say Cora and then the \ntouche 2020 data set the impact of the \nor uh yeah you can kind of stay with \nthat one but with track covered you see \nlike the impact of longer document likes \nand what that takes in the indexing and \nso I think there's a lot of this it's \nkind of more in the database indexing \nexpertise rather than something I know a \nlot about but I think it's very \ninteresting to just see the times two \nImports we gate and see how much faster \nit's getting I think is incredibly \nexciting \nso then the thing that I think is adding \nso much value to this benchmarking these \ninformation retrieval data sets in \nweviate is the impact of the backups so \nyou see this is this is this is like the \n16 lines of code you would need to back \nup one of the beer data sets using like \nthe command line to pass in the name of \nthe data set and then back it up and \nthen when we want to publish these data \nsets what you would need to do is you \ntake the beer data set you put it in the \nbackups folder the TMP slash backups is \nempty folder you know you have the \nqueries for running the test and then \nit's just Docker compose up the \nrestore.pi and then you have the data \nset sorry I accidentally put the \ndockercompose.yam while I'm seeing that \nnow but \nI should just say Docker compose up D \nand then you have the backups and then \nyou can see some of the file sizes for \nthe backups so I think it's just super \ninteresting the way that we can share \nthese uh data sets that have been \nvectorized and loaded into alleviate and \nyou just bam restore it and then you \nhave this beer data set to test with \nthen the thing with the beer benchmarks \nare the metrics so ndcg is an important \nmetric because it accounts for multiple \nrelevant documents with like multiple \nrelevance scores so not just binary zero \nor one you have this relevant sub I so \nyou know it could be like one two three \nfour five so on so \nyou know pretty much you just uh loop \nthrough the top ranks add the relevance \nand then you have the uh the log over \nthe position that it was to penalize it \nfor being lower in the uh ranked list \nand then you compare the dcg with the \nideal dcg which is where you sort it \nbased on the human labeled scores and \nthen the normalized discounted \ncumulative game is just dcg over idcg so \nthen we also looked at average hit at \none where you say you know is the first \nresult relevant document and then \naverage recall at 100 which is uh recall \nis how many of the relevant documents \nare in the top 100 so say you have you \nknow 10 labeled relevant documents and \nsix of them are in the top 100 that \nwould be sixty percent is you know in \nthat top 100. \nso here's a preview of the results and \nthe full release will be coming soon \nbecause there is one key detail that I \nleft out which is um uh with the beer \ndata says with the bm25 it's often to do \nbm25f in the Hybrid part where you also \nuse the title so I missed this detail so \nit's just bm25 with the uh the content \nitself but we'll be adding this and \nupdating the scores as well so these are \njust uh so so these are some early \nresults of using Alpha equals 0.5 \nanother thing we wanted to understand \nwas the impact of the alpha so we varied \nit from zero being bm25 only to one \nbeing Vector search only and seeing sort \nof uh what is the impact as you see on \nthe far right with the weevier query \nclick how should you think about tuning \nthat Alpha value \nso I think this benchmarking is really \nexciting for the continued search \ndevelopment of weviate as we're looking \nat things like the you know Transformer \nbased cross encoders that we add as the \nre-ranking like what is the impact of \nthat on these uh on this information \nretrieval performance how we might look \nat xgboost is one way to you know do \nthis re-ranking and all sorts of things \nwe're looking at other strategies of \nsearch like Colbert maybe having \nmultiple dense Vector models the splayed \nsparse vectors and also something that's \na little different that I think is \nextremely exciting is this sort of \nintent based re-ranking \nso now we've kind of answered these \nfirst two questions where we're trying \nto say you know is hybrid search better \nwith by looking through the alphas and \nseeing where it's better and then uh \nknowing that it's been implemented \ncorrectly by checking our scores with \nthe uh with the scientific literature \naround using the beer data sets another \nthing about some other ways that uh the \nbeer benchmarks might be useful so the \nfirst question is can this help \nalleviate users choose a model so if \nyou're working on a nutrition website \nyour search results are probably similar \nto the NF Corpus search results \nsimilarly if you're answering Financial \nquestions the fika data set might be \nable to tell you a lot about your app as \nwell so we're looking at evaluating \nother sentence Transformers again these \nare vectorized with the all mini LM l6v2 \nand we can you know there's all sorts of \ntext embedding models on uh hugging face \nand the sentence Transformers that we \ncan Loop through we can use the open AI \nembeddings API the cohere embeddings API \nand you know give you a sense of the \nperformance of different models when \nthey're evaluated in this uh set of \nretrieval metrics so the next question I \nthink this is super exciting and this is \na super new thing like I'd say like as \nnew as this week is how do I set up a \nbenchmark like this for my data right \nso this is kind of the new idea with \ngenerative data augmentation the latest \npaper is called in pairs V2 there was an \noriginal in pairs and then promptegator \nso let's take this example so I've taken \nthis passage from Sebastian's article on \nhow to use the cohere uh embeddings \nmodel in weaviate so you see this \npassage you know multilingual model \nquick test and the information \nSebastian's written \nso the prompt is please write five \nqueries we would expect users to search \nfor to find information contained in the \nfollowing passage from the article put \nthe article name with the subtitle you \nknow subtitle name please make sure \nthese queries are very specific to the \ninformation contained in the passage so \nyou see how chat gbt can generate these \nqueries I think the fifth one is is the \nmost sodium one the probability is we \nlook at say uh your eyes tool on how you \ncan look through uh look through these \nlabels we'll probably need to do some \nmore parsing and some more manual \ncleaning these visualization tools for \ndata set cleaning I think is a booming \narea and there'll be tons of use cases \nfor these but this fifth one steps to \nset up a weeviate instance and import a \ndata set with coherence multilingual \nmodel this would now be an example of a \ngold document for this query and we \ncould construct the same kind of tests \nfor anyone's data set you just rotate in \nyour passage and it will generate these \ndata sets like this so that you can \nunderstand the impact of bm25 and um and \ndense Vector search the different models \nthe impact of the Cross encoder you know \ncobra when we develop that you can see \nthe impact of all these things for \nyourself with your particular data and \nyour particular application \nso just some final thoughts um I think \nthis this is full stock search \nevaluation thing is evolving you've seen \nedian's a n benchmarks to show you how \nto tune the EF construction the hsw \nhyper parameters and now we're looking \nat the then one layer up you have the \nerrors that are introduced by the \nretrieval and re-ranking kind of layer \nso you know you first you have the hsw \nerrors with things so like as um \nmentioned the hnswpq the way you can \npress the vectors that might impact the \nrecall a little bit depending on the how \naggressively you can press them and \nthings like that and so then we see \nthese errors and matching the queries of \nthe documents that might come from the \nembeddings and then further up the stack \nwe have the question answering you know \nthe dialogue as we've seen obviously \nchat gbt and summarization so we're \nseeing this kind of full stack search \nthe next big topic is this in domain out \nof domain and zero shot generalization \nso beer was developed to evaluate out of \ndomain meaning that uh the models that \nyou're encoding the documents with in \nthe queries they ideally they haven't \nbeen trained on the any of the data sets \nso I think that's kind of an interesting \nway to set up the benchmarks uh \ncertainly you would imagine somebody \nbuilding a building a search app as \nquickly as possible they want some kind \nof zero shot model but I think it would \nbe nice if these data sets had some kind \nof time split to them \nand we can also evaluate this kind of \nimpact of fine tuning and fine-tuning \ncould be at the vectorization layer it \ncould also be at the re-ranking layer \nand I think sort of in the real world \nthe symbolic filters and the use of \nxgboost re-ranking is also something \nthat's very impactful and maybe tough to \ncapture in these benchmarks so that kind \nof is uh also related to the evolution \nof benchmarking in weba I think it's \nvery exciting for us as we're developing \nnew search features to be participating \nin the scientific benchmarking and the \nmetrics and all that and then finally \nthe last thing is the retrieval \naugmented language model training so you \nknow as Eddie mentioned we're getting \nready to make a huge push into \ngenerative search and we have some super \nexciting things coming out of that and \nthe the zero thing the obvious \napplication is retrieved and read where \nyou retrieve context to give to chat gbt \nsaying please ground your answer in this \ninformation and then you give it the \ninformation that came out of the vector \ndatabase and I think what we're going to \nsee is tons of people training retrieval \naugmented language models and I think \nthis idea that you can restore backup \nfrom weviate and then you have that as \nyour retrieval augmented component it \nhas high research and these kind of \nthings built into it I think that's \nincredibly exciting \nso thank you so much for listening I'm \nreally excited to be publishing the full \nwe Behavior benchmarks article and the \nmore polished results as we have the \nhave been 25f to the title as well and \nso thanks so much for watching \nexcellent this was amazing hey Connor so \nwhen do we plan to publish the blog post \nis that the thing we're doing next week \nuh what two more weeks for that yeah \nokay okay I should be yeah so there's so \nmuch amazing content coming up but this \nyeah this is pretty amazing \num thank you for this overview \nso uh next up we have Erica and uh Erica \nis going to go over some \nCommunity questions \nall right I had the honor of going to \nthe community questions from the past \nmonth and I've collected three questions \nthat I'm going to cover provide links \nwith and then just a quick demo to \nanswering the first question if you \nwouldn't mind sharing my screen I don't \nmind at all awesome all right so here we \nhave the first question from Castle \num they had asked if they can do exact \nphrase matching \num because when they search for customer \nor beta with using the equal operator \nthere it's returning either uh an object \nthat has customer or beta but not \nexactly customer beta which is what \nthey're looking for and um John and \nMartin had answered this question so I'm \njust going to provide a quick demo on \nhow this can be fixed you get the exact \nphrase matching \num so I would quickly go over to the \ndocumentation just uh so everyone can \nsee where it is and what I'll be talking \nabout \num so how you can fix this um \num oh my gosh I completely fine how you \ncould fix this kind of uh problem with \nthe exact phrase matching is with \ntokenizing on the field level rather \nthan word \num so I will go over the yes code sorry \nif that gave everyone a headache \num all right so here I have my schema I \nmight have done this when I was hungry \nbecause it is about pasta which is my \nfavorite meal but as you can see here \nwith my property meal I have tokenized \nit at the field bubble and what this is \ndoing is it is taking cheese with pasta \nand tokenizing the sentence as one \nrather than breaking it out into cheese \nwith and pasta into separate tokens \num all right so I have already uploaded \nthis and I will go over to the console \nwhich I prefer it's very nice \nall right \nyou know what I also should have grabbed \nthe query \nall right so I will use the like \noperator \nall right so here I have \num my Valley string with cheese and I'm \nusing the like operator and I want to \nfind a dish that ha that has cheese in \nit right \num but obviously since I tokenized at \nthe field level it's expecting cheese \nwith pasta or cheese without pasta right \num but the cool thing about the like \noperator and it is right here under the \nfilters \ndocumentation is you can use the \nasterisk so if you have one or more \nunknown characters it will find those \nobjects that have keys \num so if I if I run this now you have \ncheese with pasta cheese with rice and \ncheese without pasta I do not use cheese \nwith rice \num it was Sebastian who suggested maybe \nincluding hey I'm putting you out there \nit's weird \nI come to Copenhagen I'll convert you \num but if I keep the asterisk because \nI'm I don't know if it if my object has \nwithin it but I'm going to include pasta \num you can see that rice is now kicked \nout right because it is clear with the \nfield token that it is pasta and then if \nI \num \njust yeah obviously put rice in it is \ngoing to find that exact dish that has \ncheese with rice \num so that is the first question \non castles how to find exact matching um \nyeah so I hope that clears it up and \nalso it was \num I can provide a link to this demo if \nit helps all right the next uh question \nis are there any uh good performance \nbenchmarks on wheat and the answer to \nthat is yes and I will share with you \nhow to find it in the documentation \num so if you go to the documentation \nsection on the website and you go to \nbenchmarks and then a m you have WB A9 \nbenchmarks and since we have ending here \nwhat is a better time than to ask um \nwhat should people look out for when \nthey're reviewing this \nyeah yes I saw in the question that that \nwas also about a comparative uh sort of \nBenchmark and uh this is something that \nwe want to leave to to someone else \nbecause we're strong Believers and we \nknow how to run bb8 and we're also \nstrong Believers that competing \nSolutions are very good at running their \nsolution but probably not at running bb8 \nand another competing solution the same \ngoes for us so um for us it's super \nimportant to be transparent about these \nthings and to give the user accurate \ninformation that really helps them and \nwe can only make these accurate claims \nabout ourselves and then not about it \nnot about others wouldn't feel \ncomfortable in in doing that so these \nbenchmarks here uh Benchmark vv8 in \nisolation basically um but with \nreal-life use cases so we have these \nthese data sets I think we have three or \nfour data sets where we chose different \ndata sets um to have something \nrepresenting a smaller data set \nsomething representing a larger data set \num have a low dimensionality I think \nglove 25 is like the low closed \ncaptioning not available \n[Music] \nin general yeah exactly perfect in \ngeneral there's some sort of a sweet \nspot and query performance and \nthroughput is function of recalls so you \ncan pick your desired recall so for \nexample in in this thing that we have \nhighlighted right here we picked a \nconfiguration that led to 96.56 recall \nand then with this specific machine you \nwould get a QPS so queries per second of \nfifteen thousand which is again sort of \na function of the number of CPUs but we \nalso have the mean latency which is not \ndependent on the size of the the machine \nbut that's basically just for for a \nsingle query so this gives you a number \nto expect and and this tells you sort of \ntwo things basically what what we can \nachieve with vb8 and therefore what you \nshould be able to achieve with bb8 so um \nit answers the question is DV8 fast \nenough for my use case but it also \nanswers the question of am I getting the \nkind of performance out of vb8 that I \nshould be getting out of ev8 so if for \nwhatever reason you would run that data \nset and you would not get that kind of \nperformance they would have some sort of \nan indicator that maybe something can be \ntweaked maybe something can be optimized \nthen maybe the kind of Hardware that \nyou're running on is is not ideal so \num the last part of the vector search is \na disk lookup to to retrieve the objects \nmaybe you're using a 20 year old \nSpinning Disk and one of the vector \nsearch itself is super fast that last \nlast step all of a sudden now it takes \n10 milliseconds where the entire search \nshould only take two milliseconds or \nthese kind of things so great great \nindicator \num \nsomething that that Connor just \nmentioned right now the evolution of of \nbenchmarks \num this is a start I'm very proud of \nwhat we have here but it's only a start \nso some of the next steps that we we \nwant to have is of course \num the kind of yeah the beer benchmarks \nis an example of a benchmark that \ndoesn't Benchmark performance or well \nnot not performance in the sense of \nthroughput and latency but performance \nin the sense of accuracy research \nquality that is something that we \nhaven't published yet so that will be \nsuper cool once we have the the beer \nbenchmarks to have something in that \ndirection and then another thing that \nwe'll definitely publish this year is \nbenchmarks for filtered Vector search \nbecause right now um these are all \nunfiltered search which is sort of a \ngood easy thing to compare especially \nalso to to compare with other Solutions \nbecause unfiltered is is the easiest \nlike if you pick another solution that \nalso uses hnsw and you have unfiltered \nversus unfiltered gives you a very easy \ncomparison as filters are introduced \num they may have chosen a different way \nto do it the quality may be different \nthese kind of things so that that's \nthat's a bigger topic but it's just as \ninteresting of course because when are \nyou going to do an unfiltered search \nlike most likely you're going to do some \nkind of filtering so that's the The Next \nStep that we want to have in the in the \nbenchmarks and then \num also maybe different scale so right \nnow I think the biggest data set that we \nhave in here is 10 million um but we \nwere currently seeing users have data \nsets and hundreds of millions and in the \nbillions so maybe also something in that \ndirection so \num yeah to to answer the question of how \ndo the benchmarks evolve \nbasically more benchmarks more use cases \ncovered more more variety in the use \ncases covered to always answer that that \nquestion of can I use vv8 for x and am I \ngetting the kind of performance out of \nV8 that I should be okay \nawesome thank you so much for sharing \nthat very helpful \nand then all right quickly for the last \nquestion \num Advent has a would like to contribute \nto Weeki and is curious on how to do \nthat \num let me go or switch over to my \ndesktop um so how you can get to the \ncontributor's guide on the website is if \nyou go to developers and then you click \non contributors guide and then what we \nhave released in late December I believe \nis the good first issue on GitHub \num so here you can go through these \nissues and just figure out what you like \nhow you want to contribute to aviate and \nyou can review it we also had a question \nlike an hour ago from Andrew and he \nconfirmed that he is watching live so \nAndrew I hope this answered your \nquestion and welcome to the webiate \ncommunity and if you have any follow-up \nquestions please let us know \nexcellent excellent and I believe we \nshared a link to this like uh the GitHub \nuh first good issue or good first issue \nso if you want to find this link uh \ncheck in the descriptions and \num yeah that's uh that's a good start \nthank you thank you and this is a good \ntransition into seeing the new \ndocumentation \nah yeah let's try to do that okay so I'm \ngonna go last uh because obviously you \nhave to have priorities in the team uh \nbut uh have you gone last does it \ndoesn't necessarily mean that what I'm \nabout to show is the less exciting and \nsome of you will be really excited about \nthis thing so this has been in the \nmaking for past few months and we kind \nof mostly kept it quiet uh and what we \nreally were trying to do is uh uh as \nfollows we're trying to migrate the like \nthe Vivid IO site into like a new \ntechnology because when I joined the \ncompany it took like half an hour to 40 \nminutes to build and it was very \ndifficult to kind of like make the \ndocumentation do what we wanted to \nachieve uh but but also like we realized \nthat like you know it was time to \nrefresh some of the things that we do so \nhow about I share my screen and then \ngive you a preview so this is at the \nmoment like a private deal like on a \ndeployed on Netflix uh but we are using \nuh docusaurus as part of our uh \ntechnology so \num the whole video site is going to be \nbasically built on docusarus which is \nreact base which allows us to do quite a \nbunch of like amazing things so like our \nlanding page will look like this you'll \nbe able to actually sign up straight for \nuh our newsletter from here uh is not \n100 ready ready yet but we should be uh \ngoing live with it next week \num then we also have like the dartboard \nand the light mode I know that a lot of \npeople are super excited about the dark \nmode uh and then like I'll just jump \ninto like some examples of like our blog \nposts uh it's they're going to be \nredesigned and this is I'm something \nsomething I'm really excited about \nsometimes with some articles we have \nmultiple authors so you can also share \nlike the multiple authors that work on \neach of those uh and then you can see it \nactually looks pretty amazing uh \nobviously the podcasts have been \nredesigned slightly in terms of how it \nlooks and by the way if you didn't know \nyou could actually go and listen to all \nthe podcasts on Spotify which is really \nreally cool uh and then contributors \nguide like Erica mentioned are under \ndevelopers contributor contributor guide \nand the documentation it's kind of like \nthe busy boss here and docusaris gives \nus some interesting things so we could \nhave this uh special I think they're \ncalled annotations or something where we \ncould add like additional comments like \nhey this is like a note or an info uh \nthe code examples are actually really \nlike you could see them there's a \ndifferent style so before it was like a \nbit of a harmonica like we're like \njumping between different examples uh \nbut in this case this is more like a \ndifferent types of tops and then \nsomething that we did which you may \nappreciate or you might find a bit \nannoying but we actually decided to \nredesign the layout of navigation so let \nus know how you would you feel how you \nfeel about it would you think but we did \nhave like um some questions as well \nabout it where people wanted to just \nlike expand different bits of \ndocumentation uh so now you can do that \num and then yeah we sort of like changed \nthe whole navigation to kind of focus on \nhow do I go about getting started how do \nI install what sort of various \nconfiguration references do I need to \nknow about like Conor was showing an \nexample of like how backups work uh like \nI mean using backups for deer benchmarks \nso you could actually read about backups \nhere \num the apis like the graphql all of it \nwent here the rest API are kind of like \nbunched up together and this is not the \nend of the journey we will probably do \nsome more uh changes to the \ndocumentation so any feedback would be \nsuper useful \num but yeah that's kind of like the \ngeneral idea of what you can expect from \nuh the new site uh and of course like \nwith the VB cloud service you could go \ncheck out the pricing uh or just go \nstraight up to try it out try it out so \nthat's also available through here \num and before this goes live if you want \nto play with it I probably share the \nlink at this daily filing uh and if you \nwant to just try to build it yourself uh \nit's on our GitHub site uh under the \ndocusarus migration Branch so you could \nliterally go and build it yourself uh \nthis is a great thing I love about it is \nuh the fact that you can actually go and \nuh clone it and then set up the whole \nenvironment in like 10 minutes and I'm \nnot kidding it's that easy and it's \nreally really fast and then something \nelse we will be adding it's uh is the \nwell actually it's here already uh if \nyou see anything in the documentation \nand you feel like oh something is wrong \nhere or maybe something we could add if \nyou click edit this page it actually \ntakes you straight to GitHub where this \npage is so you could technically go help \nus through this edit this page and then \ncreate a PR uh which you know Community \nBased product like would love to see \nyour PRS if you see any feedback \ncomments or changes \num so yeah \nthat's basically all I all we have to to \nshow and to share uh with you \num I'm one thing I'm really curious \nabout like uh \ngive us any feedback and and ideas but I \nwant to know like where are you all \nwatching from there's like a whole bunch \nof people whether you live or are you \nwatching later drop it in the comments \nbecause that's like that's kind of cool \nto see uh people coming from all over \nthe world \num but yeah I think uh that's most that \nwe had for today and uh oh I see a \nquestion from URI about search in the \ndocs \num so it is something that we started \nworking on uh so the idea is that we do \nwant to add search to the documentation \nuh but it's not gonna go get released \nnext week just yet \num so Ken uh is working on it uh \nactively and that is that like once we \nhave something that is like really ready \nin a good shape uh we'll be sharing \nsearch in the documentation because I \nagree like on one side good navigation \nwill help you get to the right pages in \na good way but sometimes you just want \nto run a quick search so \num it's gonna come soon like it's uh \nit's not really just yet but it's gonna \nbe sooner than than most of you expect I \njust don't want to throw a date yet uh \nlike really close \nso I'm gonna be alleviate based \nit is yes duh you need to ask yes uh so \nit is going to be like a vivid instance \num I mean some of the things that we try \nto figure out the search is uh how do \nyou how often should we be indexing the \nwhole documentation should we trigger it \non every build uh or should we just do \nit periodically because like what if \njust somebody added like a new blog post \ndo it and go and rebuild the whole thing \nAlthough seeing how it's not like we \nhave five million pages and how \nefficient with it is I don't think it \nwould be much of an issue to kind of \nlike rebuild the whole index every time \nand it's like yeah it's like extra five \nseconds who cares right yeah we did it \nso fast could also make a very \ninteresting case for for our users of \nsort of how do you deal with a bulk \nupdate without a downtime like how do \nyou do \num for example such a such a blue green \nkind of deployment where something like \nthat updates in bulk but you want to \nhave like a zero downtime switch so we \ncould could dog food this and and create \nsome nice content around this as well \nyeah totally agree totally agree uh yeah \nand there'll be a whole bunch of blog \nposts about it because I mean I think \nlike not just blog posts but I like to \nhave actual active tutorials so because \nblog posts kind of like give you a sneak \npeek give you an idea but you still have \nto figure out quite a few stats yourself \nuh so I'd like to actually create a \nfull-blown tutorial kind of like hey you \nwant to add search to your site uh be it \non documentation or some other content \non the app there here's how you do it \nlike this is a promise from Sebastian \nlike we're gonna make it happen and uh \nJP when you're watching it you know like \nI could committed you to do something \nfun \nforeign \nI don't think we have any more questions \nso we do the customary uh waving to \neveryone to say goodbye uh we have oh \njust like before that we have done \nwatching us from San Francisco which is \ngood uh we have Yusuf Potter from \nEngland UK and then we have Eric \npullings from einhoven Netherlands so \nthat's pretty cool it's uh it's good to \nsee already some people so thank you all \nfor watching and uh see you next time \nand I'll see you on the with its like \nand everywhere else Wherever You Are \nthank you everybody thank you thank you \nbye \n[Music] \nthanks for joining us you're right yes \n",
