{"text": "Alex Cannan, a Machine Learning engineer at Zencastr, talks with Connor Shorten about a really exciting use case of applying ... \nhey everyone thanks so much for checking \nout the sixth episode of the we va \npodcast today i'm joined with alex kanan \na machine learning engineer at zencaster \nwhere they're bringing all sorts of cool \napplications of deep learning uh search \napplications to podcasting such as what \nwe're recording this podcast on right \nnow so alex thank you so much for uh \nbeing a guest on the podcast and could \nyou please tell us about zencaster and \nthe kind of things that you're using the \nwv8 search engine for hey connor um \nyeah thanks for having me in the panda \nwe viet podcast uh my name is alex i'm a \nmachine learning engineer at zancaster \num and zancaster is basically for those \nwho don't know just a podcast recording \nplatform \num among other things \num but \nyeah basically we've uh \nbeen working on transcriptions um \nover the past few months or we released \ntranscriptions a few a few months ago \nreally um and \nwe have sort of \nstarted to employ wev8 as a way to \nsmartly search through podcast \ntranscriptions \num \nbut \nyep you mean before we beat um \nthis is something we've been attempting \nto do for \nquite a while \nso \nwe went through a lot of like really \nearly iterations of \nour own idea of like a vector search \ndatabase \num \ni remember i started out with just like \ntf idf keywords and word to vac \non those keywords \nso \num \nyou know \nseeing like a \nfully managed like vector database \nsystem like \nwev8 uh \nreally just knocked my socks off and \nit's been wonderful to use so far yeah \nthat's super cool that the um trying to \nbuild your own vector search database i \nused to do things like that too where \nwhen i was experimenting with say uh \ngans and c410 i'd uh generate the image \nencode it into the latent space with an \nimage classifier and then search through \na vector representation of my own data \nset just with the dot product with \neverything i had in the database and \nthat kind of transition of trying to um \nlike build up your own vector search \ndatabase compared to these platforms \nlike we v8 and then plugging into say \nhey or a haystack pipelines or the gina \nflow of connecting it to these whole \nsearch engines it's really interesting \nhow little of that kind of stuff you \nhave to build yourself so how easy has \nit been for you plugging in the vva \ncomponents like the vectorizer the \nmodules and all that into the podcast \ntranscriptions um it's been great uh we \nactually \nended up settling on a sentence \ntransformer before we even knew about \nuv8 that we v8 supported so \nit was very simple um \nsetup in terms of just \nyou know the way the install page has \nlike a docker compose where i could just \nselect the exact transformer we've been \nusing \nbut yeah um it's wonderful to have \nreally \ni mean a lot of like machine learning \ntools um \ntend to have like pretty \nloose ideas of deployment meanwhile vv8 \nhas been pretty rock solid for us \num \nwhich is something we really appreciate \nbut \nyeah it's been \nvery easy to set up and i like it yeah i \nthink the case of uh podcast \ntranscriptions is a really interesting \ntopic around this idea of whether you \ncan just use an off-the-shelf model or \nwhether you need to fine-tune it on your \ndata set and because i think with with \npodcast transcriptions you're not going \nto be able to have a massive data set \nunless \nmaybe you use something like \nfederated learning where you don't store \neveryone's conversation in your \nzencaster database because you know \nmaybe people don't want to have their \npodcast in a central database that's \nused to fine-tune the sentence \ntransformer so have you found a pretty \ngood result of just using the how the \nwev8 has the docker compose that you \njust point to say a hugging face model \nweights and that's all you need to get \nup and running with this pretty much um \ni mean \nmy reasoning \npersonally is basically podcasts are \nessentially just conversations \nso if we just if there i mean there are \nlike plenty of conversation data sets \nout there \num \nlike fisher for one it's like \na pretty great conversation data set on \nthe small side i guess but \num they're out there and \nif we just use a sentence transformer \nthat's trained on like casual \nconversation i'm pretty we're pretty \nconfident that it'll have \nyou know \ngreat performance on podcasts as well \nand you know there's \nthere's always \nyou know \nmore performance you could probably eke \nout of \nyou know fine tuning it on \nuh perfectly in domain data so that's \ndefinitely something we're \nthinking about so i actually haven't \nheard of this fischer data set and i'm \nsorry about that i've seen uh like \ndialogue gpt \ni've studied things like the mena \nchatbot the facebook's internet \naugmented dialogue generation i'm not \nreally uh too caught up with the chatbot \ndata sets do you mind telling me a \nlittle more about the fischer data set \nand what kind of uh benchmarks are being \nused for chat bots sure uh well yeah \nfischer is \num \nnot really a \nchatbot data set per se it's \nit's a very old data set it's like from \nthat the linguistic data consortium um \nlike 95 or something but \num \nyeah it was just like some like \nexposition \nthat \npeople went to about speech and i think \nsome people like set up \na little booth where two people would go \nin and record like a few minutes of \ndialogue together \nover about like random topics yeah i've \nread some really funny papers about how \nthey set up these data collection \npipelines for uh the chatbot data sets \nwhere they have \nuh they they call it like wizards of uh \nwizards of turns it's something with \nwizards in the thing and it's about how \nyou have these randomly assigned \ncontexts and the way that they try to \ncrowd source worker annotations to build \nup these data sets i think is \nis really interesting what do you think \nabout just say doing a web scrape of \nreddit conversations as a as a data set \ncompared to these ideas of uh having \nlike a scripted character that you read \ninto and then you record podcasts on \nthis platform to create these kinds of \ndata sets yeah that's actually a very \ninteresting \num \nsort of distinction between \nwhat people how people talk online and \nhow people talk in person um \nwe've actually like built some like \nbasic like reddit scrapers previously um \nor i have rather \nbut \num \ni guess \nonline just online discourse is uh much \ndifferent than in person discourse i \nmean just in terms of text it's \ncompletely different people do like \nemoticons um \nthey like try to \nwrite out things that can't really be \nreferred aloud \ni don't know if that made any sense but \nyeah they use abbreviations \nyeah i've been so interested in that \ntopic as well and i love this like um \nidea of having say style transfer as \nlike a sequence of sequence machine \ntranslation problem and where you say \ntransfer from a casual style to a formal \nstyle to and like they can learn it \nunsupervised and the first paper that i \nread this paper \nwhere they translate from python to \njavascript with neural machine \ntranslation completely unsupervised and \ni i couldn't really i like really \ncouldn't believe that works so if they \ncan translate from python to javascript \ni'm certain they can transcript from \ncasual styles of speaking to more formal \nstyles of speaking kind of do you think \nthat like that idea of style transfer \nfrom the reddit conversation style could \ntransfer in an unsupervised way \ninto the um \ninto say a real conversation like we're \nhaving now and then \nand then do you think that style \ntransfer algorithm could then be used as \nsay data augmentation to kind of \nuh smoothen out that like interpolation \nline where you take your data and you \nhave like levels of how formal it is \ndoes that sound like something that \nmight be able to \nbootstrap the reddit data into podcast \ntranscriptions yeah that's that's really \ninteresting um \ni imagine i mean \nso for the python to javascript style \ntransfer i imagine they must have had \nsome data set of \nlike code that is equivalent in both \npython and javascript \ni'm just assuming \ni don't did they did you \nyeah they have this so they do this \nround trip consistency thing it's it's \nsimilar to cycle gan how you go from \nzebra to horses and then back to zebra \nso you structure the loss with how well \nit can go back to the zebra from the \nintermediate horse \nand then and then i think you also have \nuh you probably also have some kind of \ngrounding loss like in the pics depicts \npaper where they go from the photograph \nof the shoe to the sketch of the shoe \nthey also do like a like a l1 \nmean squared error or over just all the \npixels to structure it as well but \ngenerally that kind of round trip \nconsistency idea if i translate to \nfrench and then i take the artifact of \nthe french translation and go back to \nenglish with some other model \nso for some reason that seems to work \nwithout having some kind of shortcut in \nthe representation \nwait so it it \nguesses the transformation to the other \none and then tries to transform it back \nso is there like \ni assume there's like loss but from like \neach step \nit gets accounted for \nyeah yeah generally in like the psycho \ngan framework you would criticize how \nwell it's made the so it's going from \nhorse to zebra back to horse you do the \nin the gan kind of framework you do the \nreal fake on the zebra and then you also \ndo the real fake on the final horse that \ncomes back out of the intermediate zebra \ntranslation and that's that kind of way \nof thinking about it seems to work \nreally well for \nnot only python to javascript or \ncasual style of talking to formal style \nof talking but also for \nquestion context answer triples where \nyou generate some kind of potential \nquestion and then you use and then you \nmask out the uh the answer or the \ncontext and then you use your generated \nquestion to generate a new answer and \nthen you see if that matched the \noriginal tuple and they they can use \nthat to \nuh to generate that's how they say use \ngenerative models to produce \nuh synthetic data for question answering \ndata sets \nokay \ninteresting and and this all involves \nhaving like \na data set of like \nthe \nzebra and the horse right yeah what's so \ninteresting about it to me is how \ncasually you can label these domains \nlike you don't need to \nannotate the data so severely you just \nkind of say this is python this is \njavascript or like this kind of domain \nannotation for self-supervised or like \nuns it's like self-supervised i wouldn't \nsay unsupervised machine translation \nbecause to me that just means like \nlooking for \nstructures it doesn't mean like \noptimization but like that kind of free \nannotation or like easy at scale \nannotation you get from self-supervised \nlearning where all you have to do is \njust label the domains like this comes \nfrom books this comes from scientific \npapers this is wikipedia right in the \nway that you can just do that to \nannotate these domains and you end up \nannotating \nlike a massive amount of data \npretty easily compared to say the \nmanual this is the answer within this \ncontext for question answering labeling \nor that kind of thing \nokay cool yeah that's that's very \ninteresting i mean \nyeah as long as you just have to label \nthe the domain of the the data and not \nit doesn't have to be like a one-to-one \nrepresentation then \nyeah i imagine this could also work for \nstyle transfer on text as well \num \nyeah i mean the only thing different i'd \nsay is that like text is \nsort of a linear thing \num or like a sequential thing rather um \ninstead of like an image i guess in the \ncase of the zebra horse but \num \nyeah that's a very interesting idea \nas as i mean \ni'm \nusually a proponent of being \nvery hesitant to include \nanother model in the pipeline of \ntraining a model \num \nso \nyeah i mean this would be essentially \nthat \nso if we want to retrain the \nuh like transcription model or like the \nembedding model we would need \nsome in domain data of like \npodcast transcriptions um \nand style transferring \nreddit data \nis sort of a lossy step in that sense um \nthat being said \nit's pretty easy to get a hell of a lot \nof \nyou both \nout of the main data and in domain data \num you know from reddit or some other \nform and then \nfrom \nyou know some \nin domain data which i wanted to say \nbooks right there but really \ni guess that doesn't like scratch like \nthe in domain um \nvibe of like just like podcast \ndiscussions \nso \nyeah i mean \nif there i mean if there is uh if we \nthere is a good data source for in \ndomain like podcast discussions \nthen \nand if if it's enough to actually like \ntrain the style transfer then \ni imagine that also would just be useful \nto train with by itself \num or to fine-tune like an embedding \nmodel that would fit into bb8 \nyeah i love thinking about that concept \nof transfer domains and maybe like \ndomain and affinity how well \ntransferring from \none kind of say reddit or books or imdb \nmovie reviews is going to transfer into \nsome kind of other language domain i \nthink that's one of the most interesting \ntopics and i also think you hit a really \ninteresting point that idea of if you \nuse a generative model in your data \naugmentation pipeline you might have \ncompounding errors where the bias of the \ngenerative model just \nruns away and makes the discriminative \nmodel even more biased and \ni guess maybe i've been like interested \nin things like in images how we have say \nvariational auto encoders where you have \nthat loss on \nuh diversity and trying to cover a lot \nof the data space and tr and hopefully \navoid like a mode collapse in gans and \nthen using that to augment your data \nwould be horrible because it's just \nyou're just collapsing your \ndiscriminative model on that kind of \nmode that your gan has over fit to or or \nlike um i don't know if you call that \noverfitting that mode collapse scan \nthing but that idea the generative model \njust doesn't cover a diverse enough \nspace the data distribution that using \nit as an augmentation model would just \nnot be good at all so one other question \ni had is um what about using say youtube \nwhere you could probably get thousands \nof podcasts on youtube and \nand uh and just kind of \ndownload it that way well yeah so i mean \nthere is youtube dl which is a wonderful \ntool that i think is like not \ntotally kosher \nanymore i think youtube doesn't like it \ni think like try to take it down last \nyear i believe \nbut um \nyeah i mean that's something \ni've thought about a lot i mean there's \na lot of like really great like even \nlike long form podcast content on \nyoutube \num with video as well as audio um which \nis sort of an interesting aspect given \nyou know we record video podcasts \num but \num \nyeah i mean youtube dl \nthey support just like \ntaking the audio from youtube videos i \nthink you cannot even get the captions \nfrom youtube videos \nusing youtube dl as well \nso it's a very interesting \ndata source i would say um \ngiven its \num you know full band in the sense that \nit's \nyou know good quality audio \ngood quality video and \ntranscriptions via whatever \ntranscription system \ngoogle uses there yeah i've been really \ninterested in this idea of like um say \nusing copyrighted data for machine \nlearning and i recently even read a blog \npost about it's something like the \nauthors guild versus google and they \nsued google over copyright infringement \nbecause they're using the books and yeah \nand the recommendation engine \nso i mean i i do think this is going to \nbe one of the most interesting topics as \nwe develop these applications because \nthis data is how the models are built \nand then it's \nit's kind of hard to get your own data \nso \nit's an interesting thing i don't know \nif uh like youtube has those kind of \nlicenses when you upload a video like i \nknow from uploading my own videos on \nyoutube i don't think i'm signing any \nkind of license that says you can't use \nit for \ntraining whatever video generation model \nof me you want with it or \nwhatever thing like that but um maybe if \nyou're using the captions maybe you're \nusing their like google's speech \nrecognition text model or something like \nthat \nyeah that whole kind of thing is pretty \ninteresting to me thinking about like \nthe copyrighted \nuh data and whether you can use that to \ntrain these models have you thought \nabout like as you're developing \nzencaster in these tools have you \nthought about open sourcing one of these \ndata sets that you're building i mean \nyes i mean i i personally love open \nsource um \ni would love to \nbe able to open source some of the \nmodels we're working on but also some of \nthem do rely on \nlike \nuser data \nthat we have \nof course \nthey \ni mean we like scrub it scrub with the \nuser data we use we like anonymize it as \nmuch we can \num \nwe don't \num \nwe don't like copy it onto our local \nmachines \nso but \ni don't know \nit's a very weird issue the issue of \nyou know can you release a model that is \ntrained on private data \nbecause \nlike you can \nif you try an audit like a machine \nlearning model and like figure out if \nit's \nusing private data that's like basically \nimpossible there's zero way to do that \nunless there's some like build logs \nbuilt into it or something where you \nhave like file names but yeah i've seen \ni saw a paper on extracting training \ndata from language models that is um i i \nthink unrealistic the way that they just \nkind of prompt it and generate the \nemails and stuff i i can't imagine any \ncompany would be that careless with how \nthey encode and publish the language \nmodels but so quickly i do want to get \nmore into say federated learning and \nthis idea of how you're how you're \nusing data without \nputting it in a centralized database and \nthis difference further between say \ncopyrighted data and then private data \nwhich are two very different things in \nmy opinion but one idea i think is \nreally interesting maybe we could talk \nabout a bit one other interesting thing \nabout uh data privacy that i think is \nreally interesting is recent \ndevelopments in data set distillation so \nsimilar to \nknowledge distillation where the idea is \nto \nlabel data by using a teacher model and \nthen the student model fits the labels \nof that the teacher model has labeled \nthe way that dataset distillation works \nis that you distill the information from \nthe entire training set into a \ninto a compressed representation where \nsay you only have 50 images that make up \nthe 50 000 images of c410 such that you \ntrain on the 50 images and retain the \nfull performance of the original data \nset and they optimize that by \ndoing the same kind of gradient ascent \ntechnique all the way putting gradients \nall the way back into the input similar \nto say adversarial noise maps or \nheat map activations where you look at \nsay what part of the image is they're \nlooking at \nclassified as an elephant or whatever \nand so that kind of optimization \ntechnique would allow you to \nmaybe \nretain these data sets so with federated \nlearning it seems to me like you send \nthe model weights to the local machine \nyou update the model and then you send \nthe new model weights back but that's \ndoesn't sound great for if something \nwent wrong if you say continual learning \ncatastrophic forgetting trying to study \nall these things \nso i think maybe this idea of \ncompressing the data set and then \nsending this compressed data set back \nthat i think would probably be \nimpossible to invert back to the \noriginal data and then you at least have \nlike some kind of sequence of the data \nsets that i think is a more useful \nartifact than just the sequence of model \nweights that have been updated on the \nlocal federated learning kind of way of \nthinking about this \nokay yeah that's a very interesting idea \nlike a compressed data set like \nit's almost something i like \nit sounds too good to be true \num \nlike so there's like a you mentioned \nthere's like a 50 000 image data set \nthat got compressed like 50 images \nare they like \nare they images within that data set \nthat are just selected from like to be a \ndiverse set of the original data set or \nyeah i can well no they're um they're \noptimized directly and you use the \noriginal data you have and the \nperformance on evaluated on that as the \nlearning signal \nand so they're really there there are \ntwo techniques that i'd say are worth \nlisteners looking into the first of \nwhich is generative teaching networks \nwhere you have the outer inner \noptimization loop where \nyou generate you start off by generating \nsomething random like again and then you \nuse the signal for how well the model \ntrained on that data set performs on it \nso it's like a proximal policy \noptimization where all you have is the \nreward signal the final accuracy and \nthen there's this other paper from \ngoogle and i'm not going to talk about \nit too much because i don't really \nunderstand these techniques but it's \nit's like the neural tangent kernel and \nthe infinite width kind of strategy and \nthat's that's something else that seems \nto work but i don't really understand it \nokay so that's interesting so it's \nbasically selects like 50 images that \nseem to \ntrain the model in the best direction \nno it um it optimizes them directly from \nrandom noise \nso they they all start off with 50 \nrandom noise images and then \nlike gradient ascent back to the \ninput space so \nsimilar to like you can stack it all up \nas a big picture of say \nlike a giant tensor of 50 by 32 by 32x3 \nand then you can send gradients all the \nway back into that thing \nokay \nwow i am very curious what those images \nlook like yeah well they're mostly \nrandom noise \nin the end there's still random noise \nwith some with some kind of patterns but \nit's yeah i mean i guess it is just like \nessentially just like encoding like \nbinary information in those images \ninstead of like actual like human \nprocessable \nimages \nyeah the idea of having zero one in each \nof the i don't know that's such a \ncompression i i doubt that there's still \nprobably 32-bit uh or like the you know \n255 \nso in addition to the topic of \nfine-tuning and thinking about the data \nsets that we're using i wanted to ask \nabout like your search pipeline and your \nretrieval pipeline and what kind of \ndifferent \nmodels you're using you mentioned \nearlier that you started off by building \na tf idf retriever we've got the \nsentence transformers retriever and then \nwe've eat has the kind of \nsymbolic annotations that you could use \nlike i imagine in this case a symbolic \nannotation would be \njust who's speaking so if if you and i \nhave a extremely long conversation maybe \nit's like a group of ten of us and we \nhave like a three hour conversation \nmaybe when we're searching through it we \nwould want to annotate it by \nthings that connor said and put that \nkind of filter on to it when we're going \nback into the database or imagine \ncollecting like a like we record 10 of \nthese conversations in a row which i \nthink is really exciting for things like \nsay we have a paper reading group i've \nseen these kind of things assembled \nwhere we have like 20 people in a paper \nreading group and you'd imagine putting \ntogether 10 sessions and then searching \nthrough that so maybe you'd want the \nsymbolic filter through who's speaking \nor \nthe date \nfor just all conversations so what does \nyour kind of search architecture look \nlike for using these different \ninformation retrieval \ncomponents say as someone okay so as \nsomeone sort of unfamiliar with \nneurosymbolic \num ai \nis that \nlike \ncould you give me like a a 10 second \ncrash course on what that means \noh yeah so it it's not even like crazy \nneurosymbolic ai just the idea of um \nusing the filters \nusing a symbolic filter to facilitate \nthe vector search so \nuh \nbefore you search through all your data \nsay you're looking through scientific \npapers where you might have 60 million \npapers and you only want to see uh what \nwas published in the symbolic filter in \nicml 2021 right so now you're only \nsearching through now you're only doing \nyour vector distance search within that \nsub population of your data set that \nmatches the symbolic filter so i think \nthere's more to the general category of \nneurosymbolic ai and i love things like \nuh discrete representations and causal \ninference and \nand high level ideas like system one \nsystem two thinking fast and slow and \nall those kinds of ideas but in this \nmost basic case of a neurosymbolic \nsystem we just mean kind of using the \nsymbolic filters to \nuh reduce the complexity of the of the \nspace before we do this \nvector dot product comparison okay so is \nthis a like distinct \nfrom \nso how is this distinct from just like a \nnear a near text query for example \num \nright \nwith the near text say you've got the 60 \nmillion papers the icml filter would \nprobably reduce it down to i think five \nthousand papers obviously that i hope \nthat number's right but like it would \ntake it from 60 million to 5000 and then \nyou would do then you could just you \nwouldn't even need an approximate \nnearest neighbor algorithm anymore like \nface or um hmsw at that point you could \njust brute force it okay so \nyou basically give some like keywords \nlike whatever the name of that \nconference is and it's able to pick out \num yeah and what's super cool about that \nis you can either use keywords and \nyou can use keywords in say um in text \nor you can match it within the data \nspace itself but in images or audio that \nmight not that analog might not \ntranslate so well but what we va does \nwhich is really interesting is you \nannotate the metadata so you can use you \ndon't have to necessarily get the \nkeyword from the data itself it could be \na meta tag on it like the domain it was \nsort or what or what time you you got \nthat data \nor any kind of tag you might want to put \non it like a sql databases you're \nhandling maybe like high velocity data \nthat you have constantly updating things \nokay so so \nsymbolic is basic is symbolic just like \nintroducing sort of like more classical \nlike database \nfunctionality into vector search yeah \nwell i guess i guess you could get \npretty \nlike into all that kind of symbolic \nfilte all that kind of logic and \nmaybe like relational algebra to speed \nup the retrieval but yeah for now i \nthink all we're doing is just \nin the set i mean yeah i mean i use \nlike symbolic filters like all the time \nin our data set \nwe use we have um unfortunately since \nwv8 doesn't have a cursor api \nyet \num \nthey have \nyeah we have a transcripts by um like a \na date time stamp and \nwe can search through like \num each one by day that way um and we \nsort of like make a cursory api by like \nreturning \nall the transcripts from each day \nover time so a cursor api is um \nsomething that traverses a database \nbased on the uh like the time encoding \num not necessarily the time encoding \nit's just by something like in in \nmongodb it's like if you do like a find \nquery um it \ntraverses by like the natural insert \norder \num which is basically i think it's just \nthe \nthe actual id but like sorted \nlike the object id like the the \nhex object it just goes through those um \ni believe lexigraphically \num \nbut yeah that's \nlike one thing \nthat v8 doesn't have yet that we're \nworking around but how about the um just \nthe get graphql how's can you tell me a \nlittle more about that because i'm not \ntoo familiar with the say the \nlimitations of vba's graphql api \nyeah i mean the graphql is is pretty \npretty great um i always heard good \nthings about it but hadn't used it until \ni started trying out with it um but \nyeah the wv8 console um \nit's \nyeah it's uh basically it's some website \nthat we gave host that you can like \nconnect it to your local mission local \nweb instance and \nbuild queries and it remembers your \nhistory \nso it's super super nice to like be able \nto just like log into that and have all \nthe queries you've run \nuh recently \num but the graphql is great um \nit has \nnice aggregate functions it looks like \nin the latest version of wev8 we \nactually actually \nadded \nthe ability to aggregate over references \nwhich is pretty big \num \nfor me at least so like for example if \nwe have \num \nsome text that has like a list of like \nentities that appear within the text \nand those entities are their own \ndifferent class and they're linked to \nthe original text with \num a cross reference you can just \naggregate over \num those \num \nentities \nand \nget a total count of entities that way \nwhich is pretty pretty cool um \nbut yeah it's \nthe graphql interface is is pretty \namazing i actually watched um \nbob's uh did a talk at like a graphql \nconference which is really interesting \num \nsomething i'm kind of interested in \nmyself \nbut yeah it's good it's great yeah i've \nbeen uh studying a lot of bob's talks on \ngraphql and laura hamm has a lot of \ngreat talks as well on data science with \ngraphql and showing uh how they use this \ngraphql api and \nto me i guess it's really extensible the \nidea that you start collecting data and \nyou flexibly want to update the schema \nand then also flexibly want to update \nwhat's being returned from the thing \nas well as what you're talking about \nwith the cross referencing ability and \nso just quickly before i also want to \ntalk about the semi console a little \nmore because i think that's an awesome \nfeature of it and the gui of getting to \nhave the client to play around with your \ndatabase i know all like the sql things \nhave clients where you can query your \ndata set and get used to that but it's a \nlot of fun to see it with a vector with \na deep learning search engine i think is \nsuper cool to see that client ui so i \ndefinitely want to talk about that but \num before getting too off topic i wanted \nto talk a little more about the cross \nreferencing \nand say so i was sold on the idea of \nwhen i first started learning about \ngraphql that the reason graphql is \nbetter than rest apis is because you \nonly need to make one query to the uh \nto the to just the api i say to get to \nto traverse through all the different \nkinds of tables you might have in the \nsense of in graphql and json we think of \nit as class property compared to whereas \nin relational databases we think of it \nas tables and we'd be using keys to join \nthe keys and traverse it so is that is \nthat really a big selling point for you \nthat you don't have to make five api \nrequests you just make one api request \nand that kind of difference between \ngraphql and rest apis yeah it's it's \nit's quite amazing for me um personally \num \ni i mean i enjoy it \nit's basically like a nosql database but \nwith like extra functionality to do like \nthose reference references within like a \nsingle query \num which is really powerful because like \ni've been using like mongodb \nand i'd have to like \nlook for one document \nyou know find the \nthe related field key for like another \ndocument and like do like three separate \nqueries to get where i need to go \num which is hassle \nbut yeah no this is great you just \nyou pick out \na cross reference you place it onto \nwhatever \nclass you want to read it with \ni mean it has to be like a single class \na certain class but \nyeah that's incredibly powerful \nfor me and expressive \num \nit just sort of feels like \nthe future you know \nit's \nyou don't waste any time yeah yeah it \nseems um very intuitive also easier to \ncommunicate and share \nuh what it's doing and how to use it so \nto say compared to \nsay sql where you need to like pass an \ninterview to \nto know how to query it whereas i think \nthe graphql thing has a is a quicker \nlearning curve \ni don't i still can't really form \ngraphql or sql queries um without \nlooking up like half the things i write \nit's it's rough especially joins \ngraph \nwell it's real dead simple yeah \nyou just say what you want you get a \njson object it's magic yeah i remember \ntaking those classes where you do like \nthe uh running time complexity of like \ninner joy and outer joy and all that \nkind of stuff \non this topic of kind of like the \nsoftware engineering tooling and um i \nwant to ask about like um your \nexperience with say \ndocker containers and the helm chart and \nif you could just kind of explain all \nthat to people and what it takes to \ntake your wev88 instance and then deploy \nit and make it accessible through \nsomething like \naws or google cloud \nsure yeah so \ni mean we've it has like really great \num uh deployment uh \nmanifests i guess \num in both the docker compose that they \nhave which is definitely the way to do \nit if you just want to stand up quickly \nand then also the helm charts \nand the helm charts \num \n[Music] \nare \nbasically just like kubernetes um \ninstructions for \num \nlike a kubernetes kubernetes cluster to \nactually deploy i think um \ni think it's like on aws it's like eks \nthat's like their kubernetes service \nelastic kubernetes service i want to say \ni don't know it's probably wrong \nbut yeah so \nuh you can just apply the helm chart \nand as long as you have enough \nyou know \nuh \npods provisions it'll just pick up \nall those pods and get them deployed and \nlet them talk to each other \num i know for us we also had to add just \nlike a really basic ingress \num \nbut \nyeah i mean that's something like we we \nshould do on our side anyway because \nit's sort of specific to our network but \num \nyeah i mean it really is as simple as \njust like \nsetting up \na kubernetes cluster and \ndo like \ncube control apply \nand the help and that's it so it's just \nlike \none click from \nwhen you click on uh like get your \ndocker compose file \nand then just one click on aws so like \nhow many how many steps is there in the \nmiddle of that for all for the docker \ncompose \nthat's just you know you go to the \nwebsite and you say what your \nconfiguration \nshould be it gives you a curl command to \njust download the \ncompose and then docker compose up \nand \nthere you go it's deployed it's crazy \nand \nthe \nthe helm chart um \nyeah i mean so we \ndid \nso the helm chart right now is not like \nbuilt into that like really nice \ninstallation interface on the ev8 \ndocumentation \nso uh what we did was we basically just \nforked \nthe helm chart picked what version we \nwanted and then \nmade some configurations for what we \nwant so we like disabled some of the \nmodules we didn't use \nwe pers we also personally disable auto \nschema \njust to keep \nthe data a bit more rigid \nbecause it's being written to you by a \nfew different services so having \nerror messages is pretty useful there \num \nyeah \ni mean once you have the helm chart and \nit's configured \nyou just apply it and \nbam \nit's just like that you can get some \nmonitoring from i think aws their \nkubernetes cluster has \nmonitoring built in which is nice \num \nand you can zoom into like any of the \nlogs on each pod \nso \nyeah \nsuper cool and so one other kind of uh \nmeta question about these things is um \nhow has your experience been using the \nwev8 slack to me it seems like slack is \ngoing to play \ni guess like slack and also obviously \nlike raising issues within github when \nyou have issues with these newer kind of \nopen source tools do you think the slack \nchat has been \nyou know like pretty well organized to \nme it seems like a pretty vibrant \ncommunity as i've been kind of exploring \ndifferent open source software slack \nchats and seeing how well they're uh \nanswering questions that people face and \ndo you think like uh recently we \ninterviewed michael westner building \nkatie and we've integrated katie into we \nv8 and \nuh and so it's going to be able to do \nquestion answering within these slack \nchats which i think is particularly the \nidea of duplicate question detection i \nthink could be really useful for slack \nchats so do you have any thinking about \njust \nhow the slack chat question answering \nkind of system could be improved \nyeah i mean \nyeah that duplicate question thing is \nreally interesting because \ni mean the thing about a slack is that a \nlot of people don't really consider like \nsearching through the old conversations \nto find previous answers so a lot of \nstuff gets answered twice if katie helps \nwith that that'd be really wonderful \num \nbut \nyeah i mean i think in general the slack \nchannel is \na really useful resource um \nfor me like i've sort of learned to like \nsearch through old messages first \num \nbut like a lot of like the basic stuff \nthe basic problems i ran into i could \nsolve with a simple search there um \nyeah i mean \njust talking about some stuff on the \nslack channel like has like created some \nbug tickets that got fixed in the latest \nrelease um \nwhich is really amazing which means it's \njust a great turnaround just like being \nable to like talk to like \nis it at etienne is that \nokay \ni hope i'm pronouncing that correct \nyeah being able to talk to etienne um \nand bob too of course um it's really \nreally wonderful they're always like \npretty they're on top of \nall the questions i ask um \ni do wish sometimes that \ni would have made an issue on github \ninstead of uh asking on slack \nbecause then \ni would get the github cloud of \nhaving \nmore issues on my little \nlike four axis diagram on my github \nprofile but i guess \nwith just getting what i want yeah i \nwant to get like a little little \nsemi-technologies \nbadge my page that'd be nice \nthat's a really interesting thing that \ntopic around i mean we're going to get a \nlittle off going talking about this but \nthat topic around say these question \nanswering systems and it kind of comes \nback to talking about copyrighted data \nand data privacy how \nyou contributing your question answer \nkind of builds the technology and i \nthink \ni don't know if what i think about these \nlike ideas of dividing up companies open \nsource products into tokens and then \ndistributing the tokens based on your \ncontribution to things like that \nbut that kind of idea of \nrewarding people who contribute to the \nplatform because the platform or \ncontribute to the product really through \ntheir data and their conversations and \ntheir uh \nlike user testimonials so to say \nyeah that's that's interesting um \ni mean it's something we've also like \nbeen considering on \nat zencaster too um sort of how to \nincentivize people to sort of help with \nthe machine learning tasks \num \nyou know we have i mean we've hired like \nsome contractors to like help like \nannotate some datas a few times um \nbut \nyeah it's it's \nit's it's a weird thing motivating \npeople to \ndo things without like \nwithout money i guess \num \nbecause \ni mean like \npeople \nget \ntraining data in a lot of different ways \nlike \nsay like netflix they have like their \nlike star system or they did i don't \nknow i think it's like thumbs up thumbs \ndown now yeah i don't know it's just a \nvery like arbitrary thing that like \npeople \ndon't put much thought into but that \nsort of \ntrains like an entire like monster of a \nrecommendation system \num \nand \ni don't know \nthat might i think honestly that's like \nsomething they consider when they \nactually design what this looks like \nthey want people to sort of \nnot think about it too much \num \nwhich i guess is like a natural thing to \ndo you want like the lowest barrier of \nentry \num \nit's actually getting the data but it's \ninteresting like um there's like how \nyour liking and even just like your \nwatch time on the videos or reading time \non articles how that trains some super \nrecommendation algorithm and then \nthere's things like \ni've been looking into training a \nlanguage model on the keras code \nexamples contribution where \nuh contributing to that gives you \nlike a reputational boost because you've \nwritten this \ntutorial similar to like a github \ncontribution \nso you get more you have more of a \nbuilt-in kind of feedback than just \nclicking like and training a \nrecommendation algorithm that way but \nyeah i think this kind of topic around \nuh data \nuh ownership and \nand then the resulting machine learning \nproducts is definitely \nuh one of the most interesting kind of \ntopics so kind of wrapping up around uh \nsearch and thinking about searching \nthrough podcasts do you think say the \nclip model for image text do you think \nthat there'll be any use for say image \nsearch within podcasts or do you think \nthat's probably or maybe even audio \nwhere \ni don't know maybe because i imagine \neven audio you always have the \ntext transcription do you see any kind \nof multimodal whether it's images or \naudio or \nusing the stack of image audio uh text \nin video to maybe search through that \nkind of way or do you think all the \nuseful applications are probably just \nsearching through text yeah so that's um \nthat's something we've we've you know \nwe have a lot of uh \nmultimedia data \num \nor like podcasting in itself is sort of \nlike a multimedia format \num \nand yeah we are just using text right \nnow but \nthe clip model is really interesting \num \nto consider the ability to sort of \nsearch through \nvideo with text like sort of describe \nwhat's in the image \num i think the only reason we haven't \nlike \nsort of made more of an effort to like \nexplore that is that you know podcasts \ntend to be \nyou know \na talking head in a random background so \ni don't imagine there'd be much \nsort of video information in there \nbesides like general \nlike descriptions of the person talking \ni believe but yeah i don't know maybe if \nyou've ever thought about like um \ntreating say like a commentary on a \nsports game as a podcast where you kind \nof have that uh \ndual entertainment factor of you have \nthe two people talking to annotate and \nthen you have the basketball game or \nwhatever it is and then maybe you wanna \nso maybe in that kind of case you want \nto search through like a dunk and you \ngive it like an image of a dot \nmaybe that kind of setting i'm not sure \ni don't know that's just a really funny \nidea to me like searching for a dunk \non a on a podcast um but \nyeah actually yeah that's a really \ninteresting concept i mean \num \nit almost sounds like a gold mine of \ntraining data for a clip model like that \nbut \nbut yeah i mean for for us we don't um \nhave \num the ability to like link \num podcasts with like other media at the \nmoment \nuh \nbut yeah if we did that'd be \na really really interesting way to \nto actually search through that i mean \nwe have tons of like sports podcasts of \ncourse but \num \nand \nif we did have access to those like \nsports \nyou know \nvideos we could in theory try and like \nfigure out which podcast goes to which \nsports event \nit's like live casted or like maybe like \na \nafter game kind of debrief yeah maybe \neven not just sports but just like uh \nvideo games like uh call of duty and all \nthat kind of obviously there's such a \nvibrant gaming community around that and \nand you could imagine you have an \nimage of say a reward a player receives \nin the game and you can \nand you can use that to find out exactly \nwhen it happened although you could you \nprobably don't need deep learning search \nyou could probably just do an exact \nmatch if you had something like that \nlike \nsay when you've like won the game you're \non like a \nplus 5 000 flashes on the screen and now \nyou want to index where that happened in \nthe game \nmaybe some idea like that i don't think \nabout commenting and having kind of \npodcast and then also \nlive content and i'm trying to imagine \nsome way in which an image search would \naid in that \nyeah if if this was like twitch where \nlike you had like large like streams of \nlike video game content \nwith like audio that'd be very \ninteresting to try out also it's \nit's a bit trippy to think about \num doing like \nclip like \nvideo and audio embedding search \non \na virtual world created by like a few \ndevelopers at like a \ndevelopment studio \ni don't know it's \nit seems \nvery it seems like you would have to \ntrain a clip model \non \nlike the video game \nto get good results because it is not \nthe real world yeah that's why we always \nhave to talk about off-the-shelf models \nand fine-tuning that topic i think is \nbecause \ni think there's a lot of breakthroughs \nin off-the-shelf models like especially \nthe way that prompting seems to \nguide language models to \nto have that generalization and access \ninformation that you didn't know it \ncontained because you didn't know how to \nask it if it contained it \nso maybe i think prompting is a really \ninteresting argument for off-the-shelf \nmodels but \nthat idea of fine-tuning in domain i \nthink \nit's interesting i mean this idea i \nthink most people who've studied machine \nlearning are thinking oh it definitely \nneeds to be fine-tuned in domain because \nthat idea of being able to be flexible \nto any kind of data distribution is just \nlike \nviolates your training sort of and you \ndon't think that that kind of thing is \npossible but i do think \nit's trending towards that way which is \ndefinitely exciting \nyeah i mean i mean i always think about \nhow \nyou know as humans \nwe can understand what's happening in \nlike just about \nanything like we have context about \nlike you say if we say that we are \ntrying to process \num \nlike some media as \njust as like the clip to vec model is \nyou know we can like look at like a \npodcast video and like describe what's \nhappening like very easily \num we can also look at like a video game \nand describe what's happening very \neasily \num \nso \ni mean i take that as proof as there is \num \nthe possibility of like generating a \nmodel like \nthat generalizes like as well as humans \num \nyou know i think like the architecture \nis sort of the limiting factor we just \ngot to like figure out how to actually \nset up \nlike \na neural network to \nmimic the neural pathways we have \num and on the scale we have i don't \nreally i don't know like the number i'm \nsure there's some research into like how \nmany like \num \nhow many equivalent like \num parameters we have in our brain \nversus like some like large tone network \nyeah i think it's i mean i'm i don't \nwant to say a number and then be wrong \nbut i remember lex friedman made a video \non this where it's about comparison \ncomparing uh gbt3 with our brain and i \nthink we have something like on the \nscale of a trillion parameters \nthey say i don't know if that's right \nbut more than gpt three i think yeah but \nto anyone interested lex fredman has \nmade a good video that uh goes into that \nkind of idea of the size comparison \nbetween gpg3 and and human brains but i \nthink there's \nlike you said the architecture design \nthere's still like a missing piece for \nprobably several missing pieces but \nthere's definitely still more to whether \nit's a neural architecture search or i \nthink ideas like \ntrying to go past a global back \npropagation and things like cellular \nautomata and a local heavy and learning \nthese kinds of ideas i think will be \ninteresting too \nbut yeah that kind of neural \narchitecture searches \ndefinitely seems like something that \nwill have a huge impact and \nand it's interesting because things like \nsay the division transformers have had \nsuch a massive impact and then all these \ndesigns now as they're trying to figure \nout how to go beyond 512 tokens and the \nsparse transformer long former winformer \nall these kinds of ideas that seem \nreally exciting but i find it amazing \nthat um that a automated neural \narchitecture search like nas net or the \nevolve transformer \nstill hasn't uh say taken off and isn't \nreally leading the new \narchitectures have you thought about \nneural architecture search and that kind \nof area of research and any thoughts on \nwhether that will take us to like the \nnext level so to say so by neural \narchitecture search are you talking \nabout like the models that like try to \nmore closely mimic like the human brain \nmore so like where you um you identify \nsome building blocks some kind of like \ncomputational primitives that you might \nhave whether it's a \ndepth-wise separable convolution \nmulti-head self-attention multi-layer \nperceptron average pooling along some \naxis like or like a batch normalization \nor different activation layers and you \ntry to encode that in like a zero one \nlike genotype and then you say use \nevolution where you mutate those \ngenotypes and try to render some \narchitecture that achieves oh okay \nokay so it's like evolutionary \narchitecture \nthat's really interesting um \nyeah i mean i think \nsort of like a combination of \ni think that is sort of the next step \nbecause \ni mean if you think about the human \nbrain we have like a \nbunch of different like lobes that like \nperform different functions that they \nseem to be specialized in \nso \num and they all work in tandem i assume \ni'm not neuroscientist but \num \nyou know if if we can somehow \ntrain a a \ngrand neural network that can actually \ndecide oh this architecture isn't really \nperforming as well as we'd like to \num \nand you know \nreplace it with another one or like \ndecrease its size or something like that \num \n[Music] \ni mean it sounds like \na pain to efficiently train \nwith all those different sort of \narchitectures floating around but i \nthink \nthat should that that should work i mean \ni can't imagine why it wouldn't and i \nimagine it \nwould perform better than a lot of the \nexisting models if large enough yet i \nthink the current trend of scaling is uh \nthe mixture of experts thing where it's \nnot exactly like different parts of your \nlobes have different say uh structural \nforms but they have different \nspecializations so to say and then you \nhave the \nkind of \nmeta-learned learned \nit's like the way the mixture of experts \nwork is you have an attention layer that \nbasically says which which pathways to \nsend the computation to so it's you know \nvery wide rather than very deep say and \nyou have the attention that routes along \nthe width so that you don't have the \ndents because these models are gigantic \nlike the latest um and they call it glam \nor some title like that from google is \nlike a trillion parameters because they \ncan scale that kind of thing up like \ncrazy and then you have lessons like how \nsparsity works you have infinite with \nnetworks it seems like \nscaling width-wise is promising as well \nso definitely a lot of interesting ideas \nand i really enjoyed talking about all \nthese ideas with you and i'm really \nexcited to see the evolution of \nzencaster did a good job recording our \npodcast now and we'll search through the \ntranscript and i do i think that there \nare so many exciting applications of \nsearch through \npodcasts we mentioned a couple of things \nlike \nsay having a paper reading group where \nyou have 20 people in discussion and you \nmeet for say 12 weeks a row in a row and \nnow you have kind of a something that is \nworthwhile to search through and things \nlike say commentary on events i think \ncould be something that you also end up \nwith these really interesting data sets \nso i'm really excited to see how \nzencaster integrates search and how \nsearch will \nhit the kind of podcasting \nuh medium and what kind of ideas can \nemerge and i think even just like \nchunking up the podcast into chapters \nit could be a really interesting way to \nannotate it too and just \njust like extracting the salient point \nyeah yeah it was wonderful talking today \num thank you for having me \num \nand yeah i'm excited to see how we viet \ngrows and how we can integrate it more \nwith zencaster i think it's \n[Music] \ni think it's gonna be great \n[Music] \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Podcast #6:
