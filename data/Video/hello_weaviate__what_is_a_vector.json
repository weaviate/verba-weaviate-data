{"text": "Weaviate Academy Unit 1: Vectors. \nhey there and welcome let's talk about vectors and their role in waviate by the end of this section you'll have a better understanding of what vectors are and how they help to capture meaning in various contexts so what is a vector a vector in this context is simply a series of numbers like these they can be any length from just a few to thousands of numbers or even more in data science vectors like these are used to capture meaning now this is quite a strange concept at first so if you're puzzled you're definitely not alone but actually many people have used vectors without realizing if you've ever used photo editing software or Ms paint you're very likely to have used vectors let's consider the RGB system which many of us have used to select colors for example 25500 represents red 0 0 is black and other colors are represented by numbers in these examples each number can be thought of as a dial for how red how green or how blue a particular color is in other words we've used numbers three integers in this case to represent some meaning which are colors now imagine having hundreds or even thousands of these dials with infinite degrees of variation using floating Point numbers that's how vectors are used to represent ranges of other more complex meaning modern models like gpt3 4 or those used with aviate use vectors in this manner to represent the essence or meaning of objects and this can be done for any object type such as text code images videos and more so if you've heard people talk about Vector embeddings you now know exactly what that is each Vector embedding is a representation of such meaning another really interesting part of this puzzle is how these embeddings are derived which is through these amazing deep learning models its advances in this field that's really powered the modern revolution in AI in the past couple of decades or so but we'll get to all that later for now all you need to know is that vectors are a series of numbers they can capture meaning in various contexts we'll aviate as a vector database leverages Vector embeddings to perform similarity-based searches and other powerful operations on different types of data as you continue to explore wave 8 you'll gain a better intuition for how they capture meaning and how Vector search leverages those okay that's it for this video thanks for watching and we'll see you soon ", "type": "Video", "name": "hello_weaviate__what_is_a_vector", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFUeV3aYynI", "timestamp": "", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
