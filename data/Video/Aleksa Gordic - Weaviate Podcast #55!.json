{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the 55th episode of the Weaviate Podcast with Aleksa Gordic! This episodes dives ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching the Wii gay podcast I'm super \nexcited to welcome Alexa gordich Alexa \nis one of the most well-known AI uh I \ndon't want to say influencers because it \nyou know kind of how the term has \nevolved now I mean like here are 10 ways \nChachi BT can make you a million dollars \nbut you know Alexa I like to think of \nthis cohort of uh I guess myself Alexa \nYannick Tim and latita at there was this \ntime where we were making a paper \nsummary deep learning paper summary \nvideos on YouTube and it felt like we \nwere kind of the cohort doing this and \nit was a really fun kind of time in the \nevolution of my career and so always \nbeen like where what Alex is doing and \nrecently his story with um you know \njoining Deep Mind from that and then \nleaving deepmind to start orders this \nwhole thing is so inspiring I love how \nyou have these YouTube videos where you \nyou know hey I'm in Japan and I've just \ngot out of Y combinator and I'm here \nhacking all night I love the \nstorytelling of it it's so much fun so \nbefore going any further Alexa thank you \nso much for joining the podcast thanks \nthanks a lot for the beautiful \nintroduction and yeah please don't call \nme an influence right it definitely has \na negative connotation in my mind as \nwell \nyeah why I do let me I do want to give \nyou some some credit into the technical \nchops that you have quickly on this \nYouTube thing um so you know playing \nthis game with you and Yannick and you \nknow and we were in this race to like \nyou know summarize a paper try to get as \nmuch attention for this summary as you \ncan to build the YouTube channel and all \nthis and I think a couple things that \nyou did that really stood out to me as \nlike you know watching what you were \ndoing across the fence and you know \ncompeting with you as well as saying \nlike how what can I still in this guy I \nnever consider this competition to be \nhonest like I I like I think the the \nspace was big enough like it's a global \nscene and like there were only a couple \nof us so I I I really never considered \nthe competition and like I'm also very \nbullish on Peter thiel's like \ncompetition is for losers so that's it \nyeah I didn't know it yeah \nI agree with that super strongly I think \nthere's a lot of things that markets are \nunderserved in competition I don't think \nof it as only one of us can win but even \nwith Vector databases I think it is like \nyou know what are these other people \ndoing and \ncompetition I think is a big force that \nshows you like these ideas and it would \nbe foolish to just not even look at the \nother people doing the thing right but \nbut two things I want to really give you \ncredit for is um first I remember uh \nwhen you started diving into \nthe graph of neural network stuff you \ndid some really impressive paper \nsummaries and to kind of read a couple \nof off them the um the neural sheath \ndiffusion one as well sorry my thing \nyeah that one was very hard and there \nwas nothing in the early days like in \nthe first batch of My Graph ml videos it \nwas more like the the the the popular \nones like the graph attention Apple from \nPetro Valley Church graph convolutional \nnetworks from uh Thomas keep a couple of \nthose \num I guess uh we would hire a number of \nsay patients and then this one came I \nthink way like after that for first wave \nof like the initial series but yeah that \none was super tough and if you ask me \nnow like the details about the paper \nlike I haven't done it in a while so it \nwould be very hard to recall all the \ndetails but I did understand it back \nthen yeah \nwell yeah I mean it was such an \nimpressive I mean because graph neural \nnetworks uh you know this kind of like \nmanifold learning and the uh like when \nyou're processing meshes it's such a \ncomplex so I think you know it's a \nreally impressive thing and I don't know \nand also sorry I'm noticing that I'm \ntrying out a new camera so for our \nlisteners I usually not along a lot with \nwhen I'm listening to people speak and \nthis camera is following my head so I'm \ngonna try not to do that to keep this \ncamera in place but another thing you \ndid was um I remember you did this uh \nexplanation of Gina AI you had done this \nvideo I think it was like a half hour \nvideo where you just went through the \nentire code base and for the time \nbecause you know most of us in this \ncohort we're just summarizing papers and \nI think you showed this kind of dynamic \nof like you know I understand a code \nbase as well as how to read these \nresearch papers can you talk me through \nlike the evolution in your career when \nyou when just like that decision when it \nwas like today I'm gonna walk through \nthe Gina code base I don't remember \nexactly like how that came to be but \nlike I knew like I really wanted \nsomething a bit like more interesting \nsomething novel that's not just paper is \nalso just to give myself a little bit of \nbreak and and find some some drawing in \nsome other types of videos and so that \none like I know the Dina AI folks \nactually reached out to me and asked \nwhether I could do something like that \nand I actually wanted I didn't know \nwhether that was my first video I don't \nremember but I know that later I had \nvery varied like deep Dives like hour \nand a half two hours long of like \nwhisper code base and and uh I don't \neven remember all of the ones I I kind \nof covered but um it's it is as you said \nit's very complimentary like I I \nrealized that early early on in my ml \ncareer that if I um after I read the \npaper if I check out the code sometimes \na single equation uh creates me like \nmuch more like denser mental model of \nwhat's going on in the paper than just \nreading the whole thing and and like \nbeing confused oftentimes and and uh so \nso I knew that's a great way for me to \nlearn and also I wanted to see whether \nother people are going to enjoy that \nbecause like I was literally stepping \nthrough the code like line by line by \nline explaining every single variable it \nwas also I guess even for beginners they \ncould probably follow because I was \nexplaining even basic python stuff not \njust like hardcore ml stuff but yeah \num don't don't exactly remember why I \nmade that first one but I'm I'm happy I \ndid \nyeah well super cool so I think all that \njust um you know paying a quick tribute \nto the to your YouTube career which you \nknow that's how I first came to know you \nand I thought oh that was just so great \nand so then coming into deepma and take \nme through like the you know the early \nday you're maybe initial expectation I \nmean deepmind is like you know Stanford \nand I don't know it is it's d mine it's \nthe biggest thing in the world so like \nwhat were your initial thoughts and \nyou mean why did I Choose deepmind Or \nwell for my initial like how did the \npreps look like or what in particular do \nare you curious about \nI'm really curious about kind of \nmentally like okay so you I think uh \nlike this decision to I I don't know \nwhat you're in addition to when you're \ndoing these YouTube videos what you were \nmaybe additionally doing or if that was \nthe only thing you were doing but that \nkind of evolution of like now I'm in \nDeep Mind did you feel like you just got \ndrafted into the NBA like \nyeah I already felt fairly comfortable \nto be honest like because \num The Journey started I guess it was \nthe Inception like uh happened back in \n2018 that was the first time where I \nattended this machine learning summer \ncamp organized by Microsoft folks and \nthere were a couple of at least one \nlecture from from deepmind and all of \nthem were like fellow serbians and so \nback then I was like oh my God this is \nthis is kind of those guys like alphago \nand the whole Fame and like I really \nwant to be there I want to be at the \nForefront of where people are building \nexciting AI stuff and so that's what \nwhen the the Inception like happened if \nthat's how I can phrase it and then um a \ncouple of years later like I really \nstarted learning \num like getting into much more depth and \nand papers were definitely instrumental \nto to getting there because \num I was doing kind of breadth first \nsearch across all of these different \nareas and and also kind of going in \ndepth as much as possible and and and \nencoding stuff from scratch and so that \nreally helped me ground and have some \ndecent understanding of various \ndifferent different \num subfields and coupled that with my \nsoftware engineering skills and like \nbackground electrical engineering I was \nalready fairly grounded so to speak \nso so yeah for for like a research \nengineering role uh you don't obviously \ndon't have to be like PhD postgrad or \nsomething like depth and so uh it was I \nguess enough for me to to to to land the \njob \nso I was I'm always really curious about \nhow this like do you have a particular \nniche of deep learning that you enjoy \nthe most like I know with the paper \nsummary things \nyou you have to kind of cover a lot like \nyou know audio clip and then Dolly do \nyou know I'm looking at your channel on \nthere on the left side Like You cover so \nsuch a breadth of the topics and and I \nfeel like you kind of have to do that to \nmake the YouTube channel to hit a decent \naudience if you just narrowed into \nActive Learning or something like that \nright but when you got to deepmind was \nit still very breadth first or was I \nimagine it's quite yeah like yeah for me \nto be honest because in that period many \nof those fields were that was the first \ntime I I ever started reading papers or \nanything about those fields so it was \nnot really with with audience in mind to \nbe honest it was fairly selfish I wanted \nto do like a I wanted to have a decent \nunderstanding of all of these fields so \nI can create cross-connections and and \nlike uh transfer ideas from one field to \nanother field and so to get your \nquestion even even like when the last \npreps for deepmind started I did not \nconverge into one single field although \nat Microsoft I was in computer vision \nlike by my role because I was working on \nthe following and so I did uh work more \nwith convolutional neural networks and \nand such things \num but um but yeah I wouldn't say I ever \nconverge too much into any any \nparticular uh subfield maybe computer \nvision kind of uh is standing out a \nlittle bit \nhmm yeah super interesting so yeah so \nand I'm gonna ask you some questions \nlater about the new Apple headset and \nHolo lens and Jet I'm sure you'll have \nan interesting perspective on that but \nlet's dive into it ordis the decision to \nleave deepmind start orders what is the \nwhat is the compelling Vision that just \nmade you say I have to do this like I \nCan't Live Another Day of working on \nthis yeah so so for me like even before \nI joined deepmind and not even deepmind \nlike Microsoft like I knew I want to \nultimately build my own like startup \nthat's the same reason I dropped out of \nmy Master's study as well like I I like \nI am not the person who operates super \nwell under these structured environments \nwhere you have so so much levels of \nsupervision above you and people telling \nyou what to do I love this unsupervised \nspace so to speak and and like and \nbecause of that like character of mine \nand and the way I learn I think the most \nnatural thing for me was to to decide \nhey I wanna early on I I decided I want \nto build my own company and then I was \nlike okay let's first get some get some \nexperience in the in the real world so \nto speak in in the in the industry and \nthen it's okay Microsoft and deepmind so \nyeah this has been a long way of of \nsaying this was like a very very \nsomething I've been planning for for a \nwhile and um and then getting back to to \norders uh I guess it kind of connects a \nlot of my different vessels one of them \nis obviously the the thing we spoke \nabout a lot of times so far and that's \nthat's the YouTube career like I really \nlike being close to people and users \nlike the the b2c component is kind of \nattractive \nand uh and then there is a full multi \nmultimodal space and uh like the \ninteresting stuff happening with large \nlanguage models and and as well as like \nuh well multimodal models in general and \nso like understanding videos which is \nwhat what tortoise is kind of about you \nask a question and you get immediately \nyou're watching a video just for your \naudience for people who probably never \nheard of it uh you basically open up a \nYouTube video currently it's just a like \na small Chrome extension and you can \ntype in a question and ask hey what's \ngoing on in this video what what did \nthey talk about and then you you get an \ninstant reply you get where that thing \nis happening the video you get some \nsuggested questions a summary there's a \nbunch of details that help you basically \nuh more search more efficiently of \nwhat's going on uh in in that video \ncontent \num and and yeah and like one thing \nprobably worth mentioning is that the \nChrome extension is obviously not the \nend goal like uh I I do have a bigger \nVision which I will not disclose at this \npoint of time but uh I'm really enjoying \nthe learning and then I think it's an \ninteresting space \nyeah I think and \nthe connection you you're drawing \nbetween vision and language and your \nunique expertise in computer vision I \nreally want to come back to that but \nthis is why I kind of as I was designing \nthese discussion topics really wanted to \nopen with kind of your YouTube \nbackground and now we have all these new \ntools with obviously like weaviate and \nand these llms and stuff to build these \nsearch indexes so first before we dive a \nlittle more into uh maybe just \ndescribing the stack behind ordis and \nhow you produce summaries how you build \nquestion answering systems let's like if \nwe could continue on your background in \nyou know making paper summaries deep \ndeeply you know I think your channel is \nlike nearly 50 000 subscribers which you \ndon't get to without obsessing over how \nto like do it so how do you think like \num the whole content creators space is \ngoing to evolve with these new \ntechnologies yeah getting back to your \nsubscribers mentioned I I think I I \nthink it's actually super easy to to get \n50k or more if you decide to to optimize \nfor that and if you just like go a bit \nmore higher level like for example if \nhe's the two of us were just to start \ncovering python pythorp tensorflow \nlatest trends latest stuff in AI news \nall of that is super trendy and popular \nand like I know that that content goes \nvery well I can just see by the viewers \non my channel as well uh and and types \nof video where I described hey how was \nmy experience with Microsoft deepmind \nall of those are very very uh like uh \npopular yet I'm not doubling down on \nthat just because like I also have \nselfish interest with my YouTube channel \nI never wanted to be a YouTuber and I \nnever considered myself a YouTuber for \nme YouTube was an outlet for me to learn \nstuff and at the same time share with \nthe community and build some like core a \ncommunity of passionate ml folks so \nthat's how I think about it honestly and \nand then what was your \num question actually I kind of went on a \ntangent then I never came back \nyeah well I think that's the right way \nof thinking about it though is building \nthe community it's you know but my \nquestion is like um so you know like now \nusing ordis you can basically turn the \nAI Epiphany into a chat bot that you you \nknow people can I think they're kind of \ntwo things to this there's firstly yeah \nthe the chat bot and the summaries I \nliked what you said on Ken G's podcast \nabout how long form content shouldn't be \nconsumed sequentially I agree I \nlike this podcast is like we're going to \ntalk about so many different topics is \nlike what's relevant to you just \nwatching it sequentially probably not \nthe best way to do it exactly so and \nthen if I can just add one third thing \nto that is the multilingual translation \npart I think there's a huge potential in \nthat with these kind of things so you're \njust like how do you think the the \nexperience for Content consumption is \nabout I think it's about to totally \ntransform \noh yeah 100 I mean \nlike I I like to think that tortoise is \nkind of trying to demonstrate some of \nthose \num possibilities at the moment and you \nalso mentioned uh like uh languages like \nit's it's so easy with with powerful \nlarge language models which because we \nknow that the Corpus that they were \ntrained on contains in some percentages \nvarious various uh languages uh and so \nit's actually not not that hard to to \nadd multilingual support I would say \num although the quality would probably \nbe uh like dropping uh in by one way or \nanother which I can't quantify right now \nbut but yeah definitely super exciting \nuh time because For the First Time like \nvideo is this \num fairly complex medium right like just \njust from the standpoint of like the \nmemory and the computing power it takes \nuh to for you to process that and so \nhistorically we were not really good at \nunderstanding what's going on in the \nvideos and like even the transcription \nwas uh not that great right like until \nwhisper uh like like came out like I \nthink people are struggling even with \ntranscription which is just a text and \nignoring the whole visual space and then \nand then when you go like even which \nlike maybe with shorter videos like 30 \nseconds or something \num YouTube and other platforms could use \nsome heuristics to analyze the visual \ncomponents but like it's nothing more \nthan heuristics and I think we're \nfinally getting to the point where we'll \nbe able to to to to use models uh like \nmaybe Flamingo maybe maybe like 254 \nwe're still waiting for the for the \nimage feature to to to drop uh and and \nyeah I think I think it's gonna be very \ninteresting to see how this space uh \nevolves and what we can do with like \nanalysis of video content \nyeah I think like um like when Stanford \nengineering like uh Chelsea Finn's \nlectures on multitask learning and meta \nlearning it's like I'm so interested in \nthat but then it's like I or like Andy \npavlo's database course from Carnegie \nMellon it's like I love like I'm so \ninterested in it but I can't just 25 \nhours I'm sitting I don't have the \nattention stand for honestly like it's \nquite hard so yeah this can you tell me \nabout how artists like just walk me \nthrough it I'm a user and you know how \nhow what can we do to make you know \nthese courses easier to digest \nmm-hmm so are you asking for like a \nbrief digest of how the thing works or \njust like how it looks like from the \nuser perspective \num yeah I suppose uh just like um \nhopefully the question's not too \nredundant from what we're already \ntalking about but just kind of like any \nGeneral Vision on how we can take these \n25-hour courses and just \nI don't know create a more personalized \nexperiences to just build that layer on \ntop of that that makes it \neasier to process it maybe like if I \ncould set the stage more with how I'm \nthinking about it is like if you cut if \nyou cut it up into Clips like you use \nthe language models to automatically \nidentify chapters and then you kind of \nlike reorganize it already to convert it \ninstead of just the sequential flow \nthat's kind of one idea this is like the \nchatbot idea which kind of gives you \nsomething to you know like re like have \nyour questions answered in a pretty \nnovel way \nand I suppose a general question it and \nwe can move on if it's not no I think I \nthink well like long term \nlike I think ideally we'll just we'll \njust have like a big neural network and \nwe'll just pass \nlike video frames through that neural \nnetwork maybe sub-sampled using some \nsales and heuristics not just like dummy \nuniform sampling or something and then \nit just spits out the answer I I think \nunless the video is like super super \nlong I think that these super big neural \nnetworks will be able to do that and so \nI think we're currently in this maybe \ntransitionary stage where we are doing \num these hybrid systems but I I actually \ndo believe that that that long-term \num we'll see more Paradigm shifts I'm \nnot sure about that maybe like maybe \nthat's that's kind of how how I see it \nit's still prohibitively expensive to to \ndo what they just said and and and I \ndefinitely think that that things such \nas \num external memories uh one of those \nexamples being Vector databases and vb8 \nI do have a place to play because \nultimately uh we know that that's the \nweak point of of these systems same as \nwith humans right like I think we \nshouldn't dismiss just because it's like \nnot neural network not biology inspired \nwe should definitely not not like ditch \nthose ideas I think some of the papers \nlike uh was it neural Turing machines \nthere was one of the early ones uh from \nAlex Grieves if I'm not mispronouncing \nhis name uh that was one of the early \nlike papers that really sparked my \nimagination for for these types of \nhybrid systems where you're combining \nsolo memory and then later we had \nretrievals like retro from deepmind or \nor some of those ideas So like \num that's that's going to be a component \nbut like I wouldn't be surprised if we \njust had pure networks that could \nanalyze the video like just \num in a single forward pass or something \nor yeah \nthe the yeah the the I think kind of \nseparating it a bit Yeah the idea of \nlike uh Vision language model that just \nlike watches a video that I think that's \na pretty exciting idea I know like with \nflamingo and I think there's recently a \nnew model from character AI That's like \nthey're making a lot of progress in this \nthing and I think that's a hard thing \nfor people even to wrap their heads \nwe're already still kind of like \nrecovering from The Hangover of chat gbt \nit's already so much that it's like \nstill I think wrapping our heads around \nwhat we can even do with this like just \nyou know like I'm curious like what you \nthink about like you know Lang chain \nllama index just these kind of ideas of \nlike taking the chat gbt into an API and \nthen plugging it into all this data and \nit seems to me like that's still just \neven before the flamingo stuff gets \nbetter it just flips everything on its \nhead again I feel like there's still a \nlot no I think that's super powerful \nlike we we've seen the adoption of \nLinkedIn and and it's definitely \ndemocratizing like machine learning for \nfor a lot of the developers and and um \nwe we were seeing more I think in in the \napp development space one could even \nargue that like if you're a great web \ndeveloper if you're just great software \nengineer you might have like an \nadvantage compared to animal engineers \nand and obviously like later when you \nwant to optimize for if you want to \nreduce the cost if you want to fine-tune \nneural models if you want to do all of \nthat that's where the ml expertise comes \ninto the picture but for the initial \nstages we're just trying to like um roll \nout an MVP or something like being a \ngreat software engineer or web developer \nmight be like even like a better than \nbeing a ml engineer if that makes sense \num but yeah like all of those LinkedIn \nlamba index Vector like uh bb8 uh pine \ncone all of those systems are definitely \ncurrently uh with this current \ntechnology with the levels where we are \nthey are they're Pro they are being the \nshovels for this for this gold rush and \nand I think there's a lot of value \nthat's gonna \num uh like be acquired by the humanity \nover over the next couple of years but I \nwouldn't bet on on the in the long run \nI'm not sure how this is going to roll \nout to be honest \num I I think that we are we're like kind \nof getting into this software 1.0 \nmindset with some of these Frameworks uh \nwhich is not necessarily bad uh but like \nwe went from Pure we were just like deep \nlearning everything is going to be just \ndeep learning deep learning and and then \nthere was Gary Marcus who was like no \nit's going to be hybrid systems and then \nall of a sudden it is conference systems \nwhich is not super surprising even \npeople who were very bullish on people \nalready knew that eventually as I said \nyou like for perfect memories much \nbetter to have actual external memory \nother than like let the Network store \nthe the the the memory the coefficients \nso yeah I'm gonna stop here I was \nrambling too much \nyou definitely mined out a ton of super \ninteresting ideas the whole that was \nkind of one of the things about wavier \ndoes stick out to me when I first saw it \nis that you have this like symbolic \nVector surge so it's a vector search \nwhere you build an index of vector \nrepresentations but you also have \nsymbolic traversal and so you know you \nwith filter and search and so and then \nthere's also like the neurosymbolic \nsystems where you parse the scene to get \nsymbolic attributes so you can then put \ninto logic parsing I love all those \nideas but \num so I think we're getting now \ninto this like evolution of I I recently \ndid a podcast with Charles fry that will \ncome out after this one the title is \ngoing to be full stack deep learning and \nyou know they they have a course called \nFull stack deep learning and we really \ndived into like the evolution of um you \nknow like the ml Ops and how that's all \nchanging now and it's kind of like like \nthis thinking that it's like the perfect \nminimum viable product tool the zero \nshot models and how you can get a sense \nof it but then if you do build this data \nengine to keep training it it offers the \npotential to have you know that unique \nModel Behavior that gives you that \nunique product Advantage so are you \nthink about that thing with like and it \nseems like ortis is a great example of \nthat where you can take YouTube videos \nput it into whisper get the train like \nso many zero shot models are in the \nmiddle of it right and put it into a \nzero shot embedding model that goes to a \nzero shot LM and then you get like \nhere's what this thing could look like \nare you thinking about then also having \nthat data engine and what that could \nthen take it to mm-hmm no 100 and uh \nlike obviously there are some like \nprivacy issues currently we don't even \nhave Google sign in so there isn't no \nway for us to to actually uh couple any \npersonal information with the data but \nlike obviously if you were to just \ncollect the conversations if you were to \ncollect the likes dislikes of like \nmessages and and like summaries there is \nplenty of information there and Signal \nwe could we could collect to to then uh \nlike fine-tune improve models uh fine \ntune them for the particular Channel \nalthough there will be I guess probably \nless maybe for category for a class of \npodcasts or something one could probably \nfine-tune and get some some \ndefensibility uh by doing that as \nopposed to just just being completely \nlike zero shot like zero shot is \nobviously the the best way to do an MVP \nand and now the problem is a lot of \nthese closed \num closed apis such as open AI like they \nare you you have to pay premium price \nfor for fine tuning so I think for for \nlike open United 6X for like if you \nfine-tune the model so that's not \neconomically really \num uh like feasible for for many \nstartups and and and that's where we can \nmaybe get into the full Mosaic ML and \nall these exciting startups as well \nwe're training these systems to allow \nyou to have more control uh do stuff \nlike uh constraint sampling guidance \nfrom Microsoft uh fine-tune the model \nwithout having to have the sex of uh the \nprice uh etc etc so that's why I'm \nthinking about this it's very exciting \nsuper dynamic \nyeah the Mosaic um when they announced \nthat 30 billion parameter open source \nmodel and then you know seeing the \ninfrastructure they built around the \ntraining Cloud you know because I read \nthe blog post where they're saying \nbasically it's between 700 and 800 \ndollars to do a billion tokens of fine \ntuning on your instruction tuning and so \nyou know I imagine \num who I don't know how many a billion \ntokens is I don't have a great sense of \nhow money that is but I guess I I would \nhave to guess that like my YouTube \nchannel like the Wii VA YouTube channel \ntranscripts are under that you know I'm \nguessing maybe you know them all the \ntranscripts and all the tokens you've \nbeen processing \nthey were like around 1 trillion right \nat least for the 7B model I know they \nwere around 1 trillion for fine tuning I \nI don't know on top of my head how much \ndid they use but I did saw that it's sub \nthousand dollars in price so probably \nlike I I think even more than just PV PB \nprobably doesn't have that you don't you \nguys don't have that many videos yet \nyeah we're working on that but you're \nworking on it yeah it's like it's a long \nconversation \nbut yeah \nyeah yeah \nbut yeah it makes me think like um you \nknow having a fine-tuned checkpoint from \nMPT for each of these YouTube videos \nbuilt into orders would be maybe maybe \nthat's an idea for how this chat bot \ngets even more powerful in this kind of \nsystem like you know because the I I \nhave to I have to think that if you \nfine-tune the MPT 30 billion checkpoint \non you know Chelsea Finn's lectures of \nthe multitask and meta learning course I \nhave to think that that llm performs \nbetter than the zero shot open AI llm \nare you sure that's the part where I'm \nlike really not not sure because if you \ntake a look at the leaderboard from \nhogging face the what's the name the \nopen llm leaderboard or something I \nthink the best model currently there is \nuh well llama 65b and Falcon 40b and and \nand those are so much better at least \nacross those couple of benchmarks that \nthey're using for testing there then \nthen the MPT uh 30b and so there is a \ngap there and and there there is \nadditional gap between obviously between \nthe the the the the biggest Lemma and \nand what uh open AI is offering through \ngpt4 especially and and so I don't know \nlike there is this gap which open source \nmodels are kind of closing but then open \nAI is running away and then one would \nhave to test and and fine tune and see \nhow much actually you get so how closer \nyou get to to what open AI is doing out \nof the box and then is it worth it in \nthe sense \nwhich is not going to happen that soon \nbut like I don't know you know what I \nmean it's it's a it's a it's ultimately \na Trader you do have to spend those 700 \nfor fine tuning for our Channel or sell \nchannels and then keep on doing that as \nthe new episodes are coming out as well \nand and and hope that there is no no \nzero shot model that can just outperform \nyou because because ultimately that's \nwhat we're doing right like it's not \nunimaginable that if you have like a \ngenerally enough system that you don't \nreally have especially for these like \nvideos it's not that complex it's not \nlike you're talking Nuclear Physics or \nsomething like so in that sense maybe \nmaybe you don't need to even fine-tune \nthem if you have powerfully enough \nGeneral model I don't know just just a \nguess yeah no that's a great Insight \nI've heard that argument before as well \nthe um it's not worth the investment for \nfine tuning because yeah the the Next \nGeneration zero shot model just makes \nall that money and data collection \neffort just totally not worth it at all \nit's a race \nand that's actually what brings my \ninspiration into thinking that \nfine-tuning embedding models is quite a \npowerful thing to do because I don't I \ndon't I find it unlikely that you know \nthat you know without saying open AI \ncohere or a particular company just like \nI find it unlikely that the the big zero \nshot model off the shelf is going to be \nable to just do better at your model at \nembeddings particularly so yeah like \nhave you thought about training \nembedding models with all the stuff \nyou're doing like you know with like the \nhuberman transcripts like because I \nremember when you first did the human \ntranscripts you annotated as ml op \nseries and that made me think that maybe \nyou were thinking in that kind of \nheadspace uh let me think \nlike I'm trying to like I think \ncurrently the bottleneck for my system \nis probably less \nhas less to do with the quality of if I \nlike give a certain paragraph and I'm \nlooking for a neighboring similar \nparagraphs I think that deviating \ncombination with some of these models is \ndoing the fair \nly decent job I think \nthey're they're probably easier \nthings to attack at least when it comes \nto these types of applications then then \nlike tuning a embedding model that's my \nthinking for example the trunking logic \nlike where do you like if you just chunk \nthe sentence in the middle like and you \nkind of break down the semantics of that \nwhole sentence that's probably gonna \nhurt you more than the fact that you \nmaybe are not using the best possible \nembedding model in the world and and and \nso because of all of that \nif you were to just the sword the the \nbottlenecks I'm not sure this one will \nbe on top of the list uh although you \nprobably know more than me I haven't \nbeen following the research that I don't \nknow like the leaderboard what what are \nthe best ones I know that ADA uh zero \nzero two from from open AI is very good \nand they they were the best one that was \nthe best model when it came out when \nlike five months ago or something I \ndon't remember but like I'm not sure how \nthe space evolved maybe you can tell me \na bit more \nyou know I'd recommend um there's a \npaper called uh benchmarking commercial \nembedding apis but is Professor Jimmy \nLane I don't know the exact title but \nbut yeah so the data sets are like beer \nuh beer is like you know for is I think \nit's like 14 open data sets like \nFinancial questions nutrition facts Ms \nMarco and then there's Miracle which is \nlike uh multilingual same kind of \nconcept so the they're definitely I \nthink even with the state of llms the \nbenchmarking and saying you know open AI \nhas defeated everyone that like a cohero \nlike Whoever has defeated everyone that \nthere's not really a great sense of that \nyet I don't think even in embedding so \nand embeddings would be a tough one to \ndo as well because to build the \nembedding benchmarks you talking about a \ncrazy data collection effort like \nannotating the query relevance for a \ndocument saying no it's only relevant to \nthese you know these documents and so on \nso so you know it's like track if people \nare interested in learning more about uh \nhow people annotate these data sets and \nyeah all that is really interesting but \nI want to uh the text chunking idea this \nis definitely some yeah you're that's \nsomething we see all the time it's one \nof the most common I think First Steps \num do you see any like what do you think \nabout this idea where you use an llm to \nparse a document and say Here's a split \nfor a chunk and like you give it some \nkind of prompt about like hey you're \nsplitting this you know you're splitting \nup this document for Reserve semantics \num please like give us this special \ntoken when you want to split it do you \nthink that idea is worth maybe the cost \nof all those llm inferences for \nthat that that's an interesting question \nI I to be honest I never thought about \nit because the expense and the the \nsimple heuristics I'm using it are seem \nto be like doing a decent job I guess \nthat's similar that's similar in a way \nto the thing I mentioned before with the \nsaliency when you were trying to trunk \nthe videos I extract certain frames that \nyou want to ultimately feed to this \nmultimodal model so here we're kind of \ntrying to understand where you want to \nchunk these so that you can then use \nwhatever embedding logic or whatever you \nwant to do I'm not sure do you have like \nare there any papers doing this already \nlike I haven't been following that that \nclosely yeah well I'm kind of like a \nmeta note since I've joined weeviate I \ndon't really read papers as much to get \nto get this my information like my \ninformation diet is really not papers as \nmuch anymore it's more like I you know \nyou just like Converse like I'll have \nconversation with someone who's building \nsomething from alleviate that's like \nabout as random you can imagine \nI have tons of calls like this and so I \nand this is kind of where I pick up \nthese nuggets is just like where people \nare kind of trying out there in more of \na hacking hacking kind of sense than \nlike something that I'm gonna say like \nthere's paper from Stanford and MIT they \ntested it with as rigorously as possible \nRight but I guess like another kind of \ncool idea to float out there about text \nchunking is people aren't thinking about \nlike putting metadata into the chunks so \nlike you would you'd find the title and \nthen you'd keep putting the title in \nthere uh there's there's maybe some \nstuff too with like visual document \nlayout parsing but I don't know if it \ngeneralizes that well it's YouTube \nunless you're \nlike I guess what what you're explaining \nto me in this podcast that I hadn't pre \nI hadn't understood about orders \npreviously is that you're trying to do \nsomething with the visual aspect of \nYouTube as well so and so well ultimate \nlike my goal is to to like provide this \ntype of like insight and like extract \ninformation you know one instead of you \nhaving to historically you have to go \nthrough the thumbnails and see where was \nthe thing that happened and then trying \nto kind of you're using bunch of \nheuristics to find information like \nobviously for some type of content for \nfor this class of content where you have \nmore like sedentary like people sitting \ndown in a podcast and just like chatting \nlike the two of us right now probably \nlike it's it's probably like the visual \ncomponent \ndoes not add that much other than maybe \nemotion interpreting like whatever like \nin in that sense but most people don't \ncare about it right like you just you're \nkind of invariant to the you're just \nlike focusing on the on the knowledge \nand you you try and ignore like the \nperks of each each person is like like \nBehavior or whatnot like so so I'm not \nsure it would add that much due to these \nvideos but like in general it's a \nno-brainer that for some maybe action \nmore action driven videos shorter videos \nlike sometimes the visual component all \nof a sudden becomes much more important \nthan text local porn right especially \nwhen you don't have that when you don't \nhave voice so uh I'm definitely thinking \nabout this and I used to work on Vision \nlanguage models a deep mind like I was \nuh closely working with flamingo folks \nand I was actually helping \num bring flamingos to the real world I \ncan't really dig into too much details \nbut uh uh like I'm very definitely super \npassionate about the space and I was \neven before I joined and uh maybe \ngetting back to the to the initial \nquestion we had I think that's kind of \nmy niece like I I found this combination \nof language and and and and like uh \nimagery or videos and audio like the \nmulti-modal space the most exciting uh \nlike research Direction at least over \nthe next couple of years I think it's \nexciting \nyeah I think like maybe to tell a quick \nstory like um before I was doing deep \nlearning I was playing basketball and I \nused to love doing like these um like \nyou you try to like dunk as well as you \ncan and they're like trick dunks you can \ndo like you could throw it off the \nbackboard and dunk it you could do like \na windmill dunk you could do like a 360 \ndunk and so you and like this site and \npeople up their like YouTube channels \ncalled like dunkademics and stuff like \nthat where people search for similar \ndunks and I can like like this idea of \nsearching for similar dunks would be \nquite a novel idea and so I think \nthere's certainly like a huge thing I \nguess like I'm so biased in thinking \nabout this kind of like information \nheavy stuff which brings me back into it \nyeah yeah and you worked at bb8 so \nyou're you're kind of yeah definitely \ndefinitely biased in that respect but \nlike um yeah there is exciting stuff to \nbe done in the individual space uh I \nthink one company that's doing a \ntremendous work although they're uh like \nGunk you might have heard of them \nthey're they are in the sales vertical \nand what they're doing is they're \nhelping understand what they're what \nthey're saying \nrepresentatives in your company how \nconfident are they like brand reputation \nall of this information they're they're \nkind of under like extracting the data \nusing AI I guess in the background what \nlike the problems using some heuristics \nand maybe maybe since recently they \nstarted using more neural networks at \nall uh but like that's one clear example \nwhere where like people are using uh \nlike visual component in in in in \nIndustry to to analyze and extract \ninformation from the video \nyeah I think I know we're touring all \nsorts of topics but yeah like crms I \nthink are are like just how you process \na call and all that is just and it kind \nof brings me into like what like what I \nlove my like favorite project to work on \nwhich I feel like is kind of adjacent to \nordus is like I've turned this these \npodcasts into a data set I have a we did \na podcast search on GitHub and like I \nI'm so excited about thinking about what \nwhat can be done with these podcast \ntranscriptions and I want my \ncompensation man \nfor the data I've provided \nI'll pay you in two GitHub Stars however \nI'll transfer the currency but yeah the \nthe there's one I there's like these two \nideas I so I had you Shang woo on the \npodcast who's working on something \ncalled chat Arena which is where you \nlike simulate conversations \ndo you think there could be anything to \nthat I know we're talking like just \ntotally broadly and like about whatever \nnow simulating conversations \num \nwith like with the idea of like \ngenerating more data or or with the idea \nof entertainment or like or just yeah \nthere could be many wives yeah right now \nwe're calling this generative feedback \nloops to like broadly describe this idea \nof like the feedback loop is in \nreference to saving the generated data \nback into the database to then search \nthrough it in the future and so the idea \nwould be you simulate these \nconversations and then you like save the \nnew conversations back and you blow up \nthe this data space this way and you \nknow like I guess the idea being that in \nsimulating like a million conversations \nbetween like Sam Altman and David silver \nyou know just like taking people to just \nchat about these topics with that you \ncreate like this new uh space and and \nbecause I kind of think like you know it \nreminds me back to like early days of \ntraining Gans where I'd be like what \nkind of Novel images Has It produced and \nso I would need to generate those images \nand then you know this is way before I \nknew about something like their database \nor I'd even thought about that kind of \nidea but you would just like it was kind \nof a natural intuition to try to like \nsample models from the Gan and then \nembed them and \nyou know compare compare the nearest \nNeighbors from your Gan to your training \nset and just say like especially like \nwe're debugging mode collapse \nhopefully that sets the station yeah \nyeah it makes sense well yeah like I I \nguess this this space of of \nconversations and language might be even \nmuch tougher right to find the nearest \nneighbor of the conversation than of a \nlike \n256 by 256 image or a thousand by \nthousand whatever with against they they \ndid improve \num but yeah definitely interesting like \nresearch idea and and you can definitely \nimagine products uh coming out of that \nthat direction immediately like I'm sure \npeople would be willing to pay to hear \nlike I don't know historical figures \nlike Nikola Tesla speaking with Albert \nEinstein or you know what I mean like so \nsomething similar in similar in spirit \nto what character AI is doing but more \nmulti-agent more like more more of that \nthat could be one interesting product \narea and the research is also \ninteresting in and of itself \nyeah I guess it's like by simulating \nconversations can you discover new like \nideas kind of like maybe like like \nanother kind of thing I like a lot about \nis like to take these podcast \ntranscriptions you know automatically \ntake out the chapters and maybe prompt \nit by saying like you know uh Alexa and \nConnor are talking about vision and \nlanguage models like retrieve from all \nthe other podcasts and say did they say \nanything unique is there anything like \nnew in this conversation prompts like \nthat and then you kind of from there the \nthings that are new I don't know like \nhow many new ideas you discover in \nconversation yeah we might get depressed \nman we might get depressed I think we're \ngiving ourselves much more credit than \nthan yeah \nneural networks so they're just \ninterpolating data and like humans like \nif you think carefully enough like you \njust you just find a snippet information \nyou picked up five years ago and then \nyou connected it with some snippet \ninformation you found out two days ago \nand all of a sudden this this seems \nnovel and interesting but yeah yeah \nexistential \nyeah yeah I mean if like this kind of \nsynthetic data if I can I so I saw this \ninterview with Aiden Gomez CEO of cohere \num talking about synthetic data and I I \nsampled this quote out where he says I \nthink there's a way in which synthetic \ndata leads to the exact opposite of \nmodel collapse like information and \nknowledge Discovery expanding a model's \nknowledge beyond what it was shown in \nits human data that feels like the next \nFrontier the next unlock for another \nvery steep increase in model performance \ngetting these models to be able to \nself-improve to expand their knowledge \nby themselves without a human having to \nteach them that knowledge so that's like \nthe end of the quote I read but I would \nlike be I like this a lot because I \nthink whether you're simulating \nconversations or you're putting them in \nan environment system and this is kind \nof like a deep-minded idea right like \nthis open-endedness I think they have \nthese stimulus it's like this kind of \nsynthetic data like I guess I think that \nquote maybe is does a better job of \nexplaining that I do but like having \nthese conversations is like creating \nsynthetic data and maybe there's new \nideas in there 100 and I'll ultimately \nif you think about it when you're when \nyou're trying to solve a problem I don't \nknow about you but oftentimes I do SUB \nvocalize I I do talk with myself like I \ndo have inner characters like \ncommunicating with each other right and \ntrying to to get to the conclusion or or \nwhen you're trying to debate out an idea \nin your head right you're rolling out a \ndiscussion like a hypothetical future \nhow would that what would be like the uh \nlike if you had an adversarial or maybe \na better word to be like a super smart \nuh like opponent and and like how how \nwould you reply to all their questions \nand where would you like how would you \nTraverse that whole like tree of \npotential outcomes and and so like in \nthat sense I think this is also more \nfundamental than than just like data or \nor like it might be a methodology to \nimprove the reasoning uh like \ncapabilities of these systems \nit's definitely super fun super \ninteresting yeah I think um like also \nstaying on the Deep like like the mute \nthe alphago how I did this tree search \nto look into the future of the moves it \ncould make and I don't know if you've \nseen this tree of thoughts paper where \nit's like a language model is like um \nyeah like so yeah what do you think that \ntree of thoughts is a I mean to me that \nseems like one of the most craziest \nideas I've ever heard is combining the \nyeah definitely super exciting it's kind \nof the generalization of the of the \nchain of thoughts but just going from a \nlinear process to a more like tree-like \nprocess in that sense conceptually it's \nit's not that like well I don't want to \nsay big of a deal because all of these \nideas in retrospect are just connecting \na couple of dots uh the pro I actually \nwanted to try out that idea in in in our \nsystem in orders uh but the thing is \nthat's super expensive that that type of \num like a tree like you you you need so \nmany inference steps and that's more for \nsome offline processing of some \nreasoning tasks uh but but definitely \ninteresting yeah \nyeah well that's I mean I think the cost \nof inference with large language models \nis so frustrating because it feels like \nthere's so much we could do if it costs \nnearly nothing to just run yeah \nyeah but it's also liberating because it \nconstrains a lot of the potential \nmethods I could be trying right like \nwhen you have the real-time constraint \nwhen you're interacting with the users \nwhen there is a latency component in the \nfull picture then you start thinking in \na completely different direction and you \nrealize that there is not that many \ngreat ideas that focus on like low \nlatency real-time type of of like uh \napplications it's mostly you're trying \nto get the model to be better and then \nand distill it and make it make it \nfaster than all of these techniques \nthey're more for these mathematical \nlogical reasoning benchmarks than for \nlike communication and stuff I don't \nknow \nlike um \nyeah like kind of like the tool use and \nthe well yeah and the whole distillation \nyeah and all these covers I mean it's \nlike how exactly are they going to uh \ncompress these models and get to the \npoint where it's super cheap to run it \nlike I've seen like this you know like \n4-bit inferences getting really good and \nlike the stuff that Tim detmers does is \nalways like you always see that tweet \nand you're like why that's just insane \nlike you know I think it's like you know \nthey're at like 60 billion on a single \nGPU stuff like this and it's like but \nyeah so yeah this whole kind of topic \nand I so I think kind of uh I I think \nwe've done a nice like just open-ended \ntouring of topics around ordis \num \nis there anything maybe before moving on \nI wanted to ask you kind of about some \npersonal or personal self-organization \nthings I took away from your podcast \nwith Kenji recently um but is there \nanything maybe you want to cover as well \nabout orders before we kind of move on \ntopics \num \nyeah I encourage people to try it out \nI encourage people to try it out we just \nadded a couple of cool new features uh \nlike we added we added like suggested \nquestions for each video like there \nthere's like a couple of relevant \nsuggested questions because there is \nthis blank page syndrome I think that's \nwhy it's called like that's what writers \nusually have but like also when you're \ninteracting with these systems people \ndon't know what to ask right even though \nlike you can actually ask the agent and \nyou can tell you what they can do but \npeople don't come up with that idea and \nso this small UI Tech so to speak helps \nI think a lot we also added Jeremy \nHoward today there is a bunch of new \nchannels coming up so I think \num it's it's exciting I'm learning a ton \nand I'm learning a ton about also just \ntypical back-end business for example I \nspend the full day today trying to \nfigure out the the Google sign-in like \neven though that's super conceptually \neasy right it turns out it's very \ndifficult because of versioning like \nit's a version detail like there is the \nManifest version too in Chrome \nextensions version three and so like a \nlot of documentation is just outdated \nand so people don't give Engineers \nenough credit we like in in this ml \nspace like we focus too much on these \nlike interesting ideas like getting \ndone is is so much more difficult \nsometimes than than they would like you \nwould like to think even when it's \nconceptually super easy \nyeah maybe that's some like a tangent I \nwanted to convert sorry everyone we had \na little bit of connection crash but uh \nso back online the the question I really \nwanted to ask you and I hopefully the as \nthe connection cut out it got out the \nlast part of what you're saying about \num you know recently adding Jeremy \nHoward's uh YouTube channel into ordis \nand how you you know as I've been \nfollowing along with you you've been \nadding all these new channels into it \nand it's like a nice like continual \nupdating of it to follow along with and \nso I really wonder about this idea of \nlike an embedding Marketplace and it's \nkind of like an interesting new category \nI've been having conversations with a \nfew entrepreneurs who are who are \nexploring this idea where it's like you \nknow say you want like the almanac of \nNaval ravacan if you want like that the \nembed open AI embeddings of that book \nyou can just kind of like grab it from \nthis Marketplace and I think that makes \na lot of sense because then you don't \nhave to deal with you know vectorizing \nthe thing and that's already been done \nfor you do you think about that as being \nsome kind of aspect of Oris as well \nmaybe like you \nis someone's exciting I never thought \nabout it because I guess it always \nlooked in my mind as a very custom thing \nright like you you have a lot of paper \nparameters you have to pick to do that \ntype of embedding uh like Marketplace as \nyou called it in the same like like how \nbig are gonna be the paragraphs like \nsometimes you want to have smaller ones \nsometimes you want to have bigger ones \nwhere do you trunk like the trunking \ndecisions matter maybe later people \nfigure out better methods like for \nexample the llm saliency method you \nmentioned and then there is also the \nchoice of the embedding model and then \nwe were discussing also the quality of \nembedding models so what happens if if \nyou all of a sudden some much better \nembedding model comes out what do you do \nyou have to re-index the full \nmarketplace \nand so in that sense I'm just thinking \nwhy did maybe a like a valid question \nwould be why didn't we ever do the same \nthing with other types of data sets for \nexample \nI don't know for for imagenet why didn't \nwe create a Marketplace of the embedding \ncertain layer certain like layer inside \nof resonance 50. there was a such a \ncommon test right people were constantly \nusing resonance back in the day and and \nyou always had to do this this Pro \npre-processing to save on compute and \nthen you would locally uh deal with that \ndata like so why didn't nobody come up \nwith with that type of \num like Marketplace for other types of \nmodels not just for embedding ones \nI guess that's the only question I don't \nknow how you think about it \nyeah no I think that's a perfect I think \nlike the way that I understand imagenet \nmaybe maybe this is a hot take but I \nthey put a ton of effort into labeling \nthe data set and and it's kind of like \nyou you need to like kind of apply for \nit with like \nlike it's not just something you can \ndownload on uh you know like tensorflow \ndata sets and I I feel like they kind of \nget pay Wallet not pay wallet but you \nknow they it's kind of like with and \nyeah I don't know if I'm stepping on \npeople's toes with what I'm saying but \nit's kind of like with the mimic data \nset like you have to um like get this \ncertificate from physio net and then you \nhave to go and apply for the data set \nit's not just you know so that's kind of \nmy opinion of imagenet got it it's like \nyou know more more gatekeeping mentality \nI mean that's that's fairly annoying I \ndon't think you're stepping on anyone's \ntoes that's I think that's a shared \nunderstanding \nyeah so I'm yeah but I think like with \num you know with these kind of YouTube \ntranscript data sets \nit's like if you open source a data set \nthen scientists can like you could \npublish a paper where you try different \ntext chunking with some kind of metric \nlike maybe you generate synthetic \nqueries for the Jeremy Howard videos and \nthen that's how you kind of like you \nknow measure it and then you and then \nyou can like publish science and like \npresent it in nerves and I I see well \nand stuff like that right and so I guess \nlike it's kind of interesting to me like \nas especially like with as I think about \nwig a development it's like what kind of \ndata set do we want to \nyou know like with a n benchmarks it's \nlike we make some Innovation on product \nquantization it's like okay we're going \nto tell you about like the sift vectors \nrecall and it's like that's pretty \nacademically sound but then I worry \nabout if you can tell the whole story \nlike it compared to like the data set \nordis has if like we could show \nsomething like some Innovation and \nembeddings that you know creates this \nbetter experience for orders kind of \nlike by using these transcripts as the \ndata set and then and then also get like \nthe academic credit of like oh we did \nthis clever technique because we're \nGeniuses \nyeah so yeah I'm definitely not in that \ngame like I it should come on the PHD \nroute but I took a completely different \ndirection \nyeah yeah \nso anyway so yeah I I think it's quite \nan interesting idea and there's I think \nthere's all sorts of cool things you can \ndo with this orders \nyou know when I first saw your Cuban \nhuberman transcripts podcast uh uh uh \ndemo with the website I thought that was \nsuch a cool demo and I'd encourage \neveryone to check out ordis of course \nand so transitioning topics a bit to \nyour I think you have a lot of \ninteresting ideas in personal \norganization obviously you know you've \nreached the height of machine learning \nsuccess and deepmind and your startup \nCEO founder you know you need to be you \nobviously need to think about this quite \na lot so I one idea you mentioned in \nKen's podcast was about analogs of \nperiodization and weightlifting and how \nyou think about your information diet \nand you know the periodization maybe you \nyou want to explain the idea \nyeah sure I mean \num the idea is fairly simple when you're \ntrying to build muscles in power lifting \nyou you're not going to try and and \nincrease your your weights every single \nworkout because ultimately you're going \nto saturate and you're probably going to \nhurt yourself right and so yeah what \nthey have is some type of like uh you \nyou keep on increasing like maybe if you \nhave a periods like so-called macro \ncycles of like three month periods and \nyou keep on increasing the weight maybe \nevery two workouts increase to two and a \nhalf kilos or something and then at the \nend of that period what you do is you \ndrop by some percentage for example your \nOne Max strap is maybe 300 kilos and you \nlike your last workouts for maybe like \n80 percent of that of that number and \nthen it dropped to maybe like 60 and \nthen you start from there like you do \nthe so-called deloading and then you you \nstart another another cycle \num and uh I basically borrowed the \nterminology when when I was learning new \nsubjects uh because I I like to treat \nthe treat brain as a physical thing as \nit is right like ultimately you do have \nto form those synapses and that's a \nbiological process and metric has to \nmove around and things have to be built \nup and so because of that I think it's \nreasonable to make these types of breaks \nand periods and like chunk your your \nyour uh like kind of organizing \nstructure learning in that way that's \nwhy I think about it I think it's a \nfairly simple uh like uh analogy and I \nwould be surprised if nobody came up \nwith this like already I did pick it up \nmyself but like I would be surprised if \nnobody is already talking about it's \nfairly obvious connection \nwell I think of um like when I was \nlistening to you speak about originally \nI thought it was so interesting because \nI think kind of like in weightlifting \nthere I think like rep ranges are the \nother thing to think about like you have \nlike a hypertrophy cycle you know \nyou know where you would do like two to \nfour reps four to eight reps eight to \ntwelve and it ends up being an entirely \ndifferent workout and so I think the \nanalog here is like whether you're \nreading papers or if you're like hacking \ntogether on a project or if you're um \nyou know writing deeply or if you're say \nuh interviewing like you know uh talking \nto customers or your product so sorry so \nthese are like four separate tasks \nexactly different dimensions whereas in \nworkout maybe you have like a volume and \nintensity like I could be increasing the \nweights or I could be increasing the \nvolume I need a number of repetitions \nmaybe like you definitely have more X's \nwhen you're learning but like there \nthere's also this workout and rest you \nhave to sleep if you have to like \nnutrition has to be proper all of that \ncombined I think that also translates \ninto the learning space you do have to \nsleep nicely and like we do know that \nthe Eureka The Epiphany moment uh no pun \nintended uh like do come off on when \nyou're just chilling and like having a \nhot shower or taking a look outside in \nthe nature uh and and and and yeah I \nthink there is a lot of cool insights \nyou could pick up from from like \nthat other space \nis it do you think about organizing your \ntime that because like for me honestly \nit's just like a chaotic mix-up of those \ntasks there's no order to like what is \ndone like I don't have like a reading \nweek uh engineering week uh talking to \npeople week but do you think about \norganizing your time in that way \nuh currently it's more on a day-to-day \nbasis like again it depends on the stage \nof your life like back then I was trying \nto learn so many different topics and I \nthink that was the best approach for \nthat currently I still do have some \nstructure but it's more on a on a daily \nbasis like I I know when they have a \nworkout like I just had a workout \nimmediately before this this this \npodcast and then like I I have certain \nnutrition after the workout uh like I \nhave regular sleeping hours and like I \nhave maybe cold shower on like 5 p.m and \nand so like I do have some structure \naround the structure I'm trying to put \nin everything else uh and I do try to if \nI don't have it I feel I'm not as \nproductive I think it's very important \nto have some type of rigidity to \nconstrain your time in one way or or \nanother but that's what works for me \nyeah I think like something that's \nworked for me just like little little \nthings is like trying to I try to have \nlike meetings every day in like two time \nslots like between you know like eleven \nto one and four to six if you know if it \nallows itself to be organized that way \nand and then I like to have those in the \ncalendar and then I have like my morning \nsession I have my afternoon session and \nthen the pressure of being like if I \ndon't do my deep work before the 11 to 1 \nthen I'm then it's lost and and so \nthat's kind of just like a little thing \nthat I do in addition to things like you \nknow I maybe don't do cold showers as \noften as I should but \nyeah \nyeah I mean I mean again it depends \nwhether I think I think Paul Graham had \nthis uh like distinction between like \nthe the builders the makers and then was \nit the managers I might be missing out \nthe other group because I'm not part of \nthe group but like the whole point is \nwhen you're a maker and Builder you \nreally need to have these prolonged \nperiods of time with no interruptions \nand and so if you do have a chance and I \nlikely do have that like I can just \nschedule or or like not yet meetings at \nall and usually I don't I rarely have \nmeetings to be honest I have these I \nstarted having attending podcasts a bit \nmore like on Fridays but like most of my \ntime I try and get into this flow and \nfor that flow you you do you need like \nspans of time or like three four hours \nto just get deeply into something \notherwise or even more \num otherwise I don't feel as productive \nyeah I I guess like um yeah I used to \nlike oh \nit's so interesting like I I also agree \nlike um for me it's like more than three \nhours is like uh I'll probably like not \nreally be I'll probably like be on my \ncomputer but like I'm like half you know \nlike after three hours so that's what I \nkind of like to just do like three hours \nat a time and then meetings and that \nkind of thing but the the other kind of \nmeta topic is I'm curious as you're \nbuilding ordis how your perspective has \nchanged on breadth first thinking and \ndepth first thinking like um you know \nsomething like you mentioned debugging \nthis uh sign in error with Google how \nwould you categorize that kind of task \nyeah well well again I would categorize \nit as as bread for a spill because it's \none day right like like I do a bunch of \nstuff I have to take care of I currently \nI'm a single employee and my girlfriend \nis like doing the product design and \nshe's also helping around different \nother stuff but but like the technical \ncomponent I'm basically building the \nwhole system so that means I have to be \nall around the place I have to do the \nthe full data pipeline uh the robustness \nof the data pipeline the back end the \nagain the some SLA like and then the \nfront-end part and and thinking about UI \nand having user studies actually started \nhaving more and more user studies and \nsome of those as a consequence some of \nthose UI decisions I made were a \nconsequence of those user studies and so \nit's fairly broad like in that \nperspective there is the marketing \ncomponent obviously \num like community outreach all of that \nso it's very very all around the place \nit's not focused like in in in the same \nsense as some PhD guy or somebody \nworking at deepmind right now on a \nparticular like research is doing right \nlike even though on this micro like in \nin this if you take a look just at as a \nday as a Time unit then I was just doing \nthis obsessively the whole day like for \nlike six seven hours already or \nsomething \nfirst and yeah I think well I think my \npersonality and I think maybe you share \nthis is like that kind of if I was doing \nsix to seven hours of thinking about uh \nlike I have a gradient spiking error and \nI'm like trying to debug it for the last \ntime I don't know I don't really have \nthe intention to do that have like a \nlittle bit of marketing a little bit \nlike I I for me the breadth first it \nkind of like keeps me having fun with it \nlike if uh but yeah yeah I definitely \ncan can empathize with you but like I I \nthink I I can still I can pull it \nthrough like I think it's very important \nlike oftentimes there will be issues \nwhere you're stuck with something and \nyou have to push it through and do just \nsingle thing for for days and I think I \ndo have that skill uh it is harder it \ndoes require like there is like a \nphysical manifestation of pain sometimes \nlike just because like oh my God you're \njust pissed off with everything and you \njust but you have to push through it and \nso \num it's a skill I think it can be built \nas anything else but probably yeah \ndefinitely more enjoyable when you're \ndoing like when you're having this this \nbroader understanding of everything and \njust yeah \nyeah I think like in the psychology of \nlike the most painful thing you can do \nthat's for sure I think like the most \npainful thing is when you're solving a \ncoding error that like the the so when \nyou do solve it it's not intellectually \nsatisfying at all it's just like I can't \nbelieve that was the thing right like \nbut like I I think when when you when \nyou're an engineer when you're a \nsoftware engineer you learn to \nappreciate those moments because most of \nyour job looks like that for example \nhere I really like like Greg Greg \nBrockman at least according to what I \ncan see according to his tweets he \nseemed to be that type of person he's \nlike like pushing through these very \npainful boring details nitty-gritty \ndetails there was on some off by one \nerror or like some some like some \nredundant copying between the GPU and \nthe CPU host or whatnot like and he \nafter seven hours of digging deeply he \nfound like uh the the problem was like \nobvious in retrospect but until find it \nright it's like the asymmetry between \nverifying versus finding the solution \nvery very exciting \nyeah yeah oh yeah there are a lot of \npeople who do that better than I do and \nI just respect it enormously it looks \nhard but every now and then I find \nmyself doing like doing problems like \nthat but yeah that like just you know \ngetting into the CPU profiling and all \nthat kind of stuff is really a huge \nskill one other thing you said that's \nreally interesting that I relate to a \nlot in my life is my fiance also works \nat uh we VA and we work together as a \ncouple who also like talks a lot about \nwork and so I'm really interested to \nhear that like your girlfriend is doing \nthe product design it has all that like \nmy experience has been it's like just a \nton of fun and maybe we talk about work \na little more often than normal couple \nwould I would say in like 100 \nhahaha \nyeah but it also ends up being a nice \nconversation topic I think in your \nrelationship I I don't know how my \nrelationship would look like if we were \nnot like connected on this project like \nmost of my time like I like since like \nthe moment they wake up until 2 A.M 3 \nA.M I'm literally constantly working in \nwhy one way or another with a couple of \nthese breaks I mentioned like because \nthey are important so like I'm not sure \nwe like where I could squeeze in that \nadditional time to to keep the \nrelationship healthy so because of that \nI'm very grateful we are actually super \naligned on on that front and she she and \nI we are both aware of the dynamic and \num \nyeah I think that's exciting you know \nlike I mean maybe a thing that popped \ninto my mind talking about this whole \nthing is if you know that the guy who is \nuh the CEO of ruplet I think I'm I'm \nJudd is his name he's actually I don't \nknow if you knew this but his uh his \nwife is his co-founder \nso and then that's that's super exciting \nand they they know they've now crossed \nthe like they are a unicorn company now \nalready and and they've been in the game \nfor like seven years and since recently \nthey've been just exploding and I think \nI really love to hear those those \nstories where people are not inside of \nthe common pattern I really like respect \nthat because the pattern is you want to \nbe two to three founders uh like mostly \nguys uh not not like and then like like \npreferably Stanford \nEtc like you know what I mean like those \nlike like YC has this better matching \nand you have these companies and like \nthey're all these expectations and \nstatistics and so when you hear such a \noutlier like \nsucceeds it's very it's very um like \nmotivating as well right because that \nmeans okay now maybe maybe we can do \nthis or or same with me like I came from \nlike Serbia and like this guy was like \njust self-studying and then all of a \nsudden he's like in the in the best top \nAI like lab in the world like okay maybe \nI can do this and so I like I think \nthose are very important for like just \nlike \nlike full in the world I guess \nawesome well Alexa man thank you so much \nfor joining the podcast I had so much \nfun talking about all the technical \nideas as well as hearing about how \nyou're managing your time or to such an \nexciting project I'm so excited to see \nhow it evolves and thank you so much \nagain \nthanks a lot man I really enjoyed the \nconversation \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Aleksa Gordic - Weaviate Podcast #55!", "path": "", "link":
