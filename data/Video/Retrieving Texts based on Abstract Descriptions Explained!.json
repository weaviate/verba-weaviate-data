{"text": "This video explores a new paper exploring the use of summarization chains to represent long texts and use (original text, ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching weave on YouTube this video \nwill dive into a new paper titled \nretrieving texts based on abstract \ndescriptions quickly before getting into \nit if you like these kind of paper \nsummary videos please let us know by \nhitting the like button and subscribing \nto the channel here's a quick overview \nof the paper in case you're in a hurry \nand don't want to hear the full \nexperimental details so with this \nconcept of retrieving text based on \nabstract descriptions abstract \ndescriptions what drew me to this paper \nis it's similarity to this concept of \nsummary indexing so summary indexing \ndescribes maybe at the chunk level so \nfor each text Chunk say you're you know \nyou have full podcast Clips or \nparagraphs of text instead of just \nvectorizing that full podcast clip you'd \ninstead use say a large language model \nto write a summary of of the text and \nthen vectorize that summary of the text \nwe'll talk about how economical it is to \nuse a large language model for this task \nbut that's kind of the general setup is \nyou know you summarize the full thing \ninto some whether you know how you write \nthe summaries whether it's an abstract \ndescription that kind of blur out the \nspecific details or just a summary of \nthe you know the info information \ncontent then vectorizing and indexing \nthis content is quite an interesting \nidea it's also very interesting for this \nconcept of a top level index so say your \ndata is you know \npodcasts or books something that has \nlike a high level structure and then it \nhas is made up of these Atomic chunks so \nyou you use like a summarization chain \nto summarize the chunks and then you \nvectorize this summary so now you can \nsearch through the you know at the \npodcast level and then search within the \nchunks once you have the matching \npodcast another interesting idea so this \nkind of concept of summary indexing and \nthen abstract descriptions that's kind \nof like the the semantic match that Drew \nme to this paper but they have this \nreally interesting new connection where \nyou use these summaries to train \nembedding models and they publish these \nnew embedding models they make some big \nclaims about the quality of them we've \nintegrated them in weviate and they do \nlook like they're pretty interesting \nmodels so it's quite an interesting \npaper that actually ends up being \nrelated to these works like in pairs \npromptigator you know this kind of idea \nof use large language models to generate \nsay queries or in this case descriptions \nthat you can then use to you know \nbenchmark the performance of say you \nknow different zero shot embedding \nmodels or train your own embedding \nmodels so this concept of summary \nindexing I have to give a quick shout \nout to Jerry Lew Alum index he's reading \na lot of great content about you know \nthis kind of idea of using these \nsummarization chains to then represent \nyou know high level objects based on \ntheir summaries \nthere's also really uh relevant for what \nwe've been doing with generative \nfeedback loops generative feedback loops \ngenerally describing taking data from \nwevia sending it to an llm and then \nsaving that generated data back to \nalleviate so you can semantic search \nthrough the generated results so you \nknow you write the summary and then save \nthe summary back to Evie and then you \nindex the summary to search through the \nsummaries so here's a quick explanation \nof what they do in the paper they use \nthis prompt let's write abstract \ndescriptions of sentences you know the \nfew shot prompting idea where you give \nit a sentence and an example of an \nabstract description so in this case an \nabstract description it doesn't mean a \nsummary of long text it means a \ntransformation of the text into the \nabstract thing it represents and so \nwe'll see an example of that in a second \nalso in the prompt you have this kind of \nlike note you know some more meta \ninformation about the tasks this kind of \nprompting strategy then one other \ninteresting thing about the prompting \nstrategy is that you have this write \nfive good and then five bad descriptions \nand then output a Json file with the \nkeys good bad this is a really \ninteresting prompting trick that you can \nuse to kind of get like you know 10 \ngeneration out of one prompt and then \nyou know you index the keys and give \nthings like say the Lang chain output \nparser camel case this like one example \nof how you structure these outputs to \nmake it obey the Json file I mean these \nlanguages models are really surprisingly \ngood at respecting this kind of Json \nfile structure and then you can you know \nparse it and send it along the chain \nso here's an example of what they mean \nby abstract descriptions \nsay you have a sentence like dopamine \nconstitutes about 80 of the \ncatecholamine content in the brain you \nthen transform that specific sentence \ninto a neurotransmitter found in the \nbrain in high concentrations because \nthis abstract description is probably \nmore likely to match the query so like \nimagine a user and their information \nneeds they come and they're like curious \nabout neurotransmitters in the brain and \nso this kind of abstract description it \nprobably like vectorizes and indexes \nbetter than this specific sentence and \nthat's kind of the key Insight but the \nother key Insight is that they also \ngenerate bad descriptions and then they \nuse this to train embedding models so \nit's a really interesting like \ngenerative data augmentation and then \nself-supervised way to train these next \ngeneration of embedding models and you \nknow they've publish new embedding \nmodels so staying on this concept \nquickly of how embedding models are \ntrained this is something at weavier \nwe're always trying to stay on top of \nand give people the best advice of where \nthe best text embedding models are which \nyou know vectorization models use so the \ngeneral idea is that you want to have \ngood negatives when you're training so \nin your contrastive learning objective \nyou're trying to make the vector \nrepresentation of this meerkat similar \nto the vector representation of this \nalternate view of a meerkat but then not \na similar Vector to this picture of New \nYork or this golden retriever so the \nidea of good negatives versus bad \nnegatives is that you know contrasting \nthe the vectors of these two meerkat \npictures with a dog is is better for \nlearning a semantic embedding space than \ncontrasting it with this picture of a \nbuilding so we previously had looked at \nthis paper from Ori ROM and his \ncollaborators about uh the spider \nalgorithm so the spider algorithm is a \nway to look at overlapping engrams \nbetween passages in Wikipedia articles \nand so you know like if two passages of \ntext you have the same engram like the \npriesthood for himself and his male \ndescendants that'd be like a good \nexample of a positive and then you just \nyou know use the other Snippets of text \nin the Wikipedia page as negatives so so \nwe're always on this hunt for how can we \nself-supervise how can we you know \nautomatically annotate positives and \nnegatives as scale with web scale data \nand that's kind of like where the zero \nshot embedding models come from so this \npaper is presenting a really interesting \nnew way to you know instead of looking \nat these overlapping engrams from \nWikipedia Pages you're contrasting the \ngood descriptions with the bad \ndescriptions so this is the anchor this \nis the positive and this is the negative \nand that helps with you know the \nrepresentation learning task and you \nknow they generate quite a large scale \namount of these roughly I think like 169 \n000 that they use to do this so you can \nimagine you know scaling this up like \ncrazy and it's pretty interesting so so \nin the end they're gonna you know \ncombine two loss functions the triplet \nloss triplet losses where you have you \nknow the distance between the anchor and \nthe positive and the distance between \nthe anchor and the negative this kind of \nthing and then you also have that in \nbatch negative thing and then you know \nyou weight the two loss functions with \nthis Alpha then in the end the um \nthe way that they evaluate this you know \nthe the state of evaluating embedding \nmodels is you know you have the beer \nBenchmark which is a pretty solid thing \nbut generally it's sort of hand wavy you \nknow this this is sort of the Pinnacle \nof that but that you know they're gonna \nthey have a human study survey and they \nyou know they do show that the humans \nrate the humans in the study rate this \nmodel to perform better than these other \nbass lines like all mpnet based two \nthat's a really strong you know model \navailable in hugging face sentence \nTransformers or say bm25 which is the \nkeyword matching so you know five is so \nyou know we'll get more into the details \nbut basically they show the uh the human \nannotators five search results uh they a \nmix of five from one of the models and \nfive from another of the models and then \nthey rate the top five results and so \nyou know they're saying that they chose \nthis one five most of the time and then \nsay bm25 was chosen like zero out of the \ntimes at most times so this thing that \nall these models perform better than \nbm25 really in that you know this model \nis the best quickly before diving \nfurther into the details of the paper \nquick thank you to March Nantes for \nadding these models into Eva's text \neffect Transformers images so if you \nwant to run these yourself here is the \nimage for adding these new models so you \nknow if you want to just stop the video \nnow and just see what these models can \ndo with your weeviate example then this \nis the image to do so so thanks Martin \nso following that quick description of \nthe paper let's kind of walk through it \na little slower so the background is \nthat this paper is marrying these ideas \nof summary indexing with this General \nconcept of large language model \ngenerated training data for \nself-supervising embedding model \ntrainings so this idea of summary \nindexing has been one of the most \npowerful kind of ideas around Lang chain \nllama index and these kind of llm tools \nso this article from Erica Cardenas \npublished February 21st is you know when \nLang chain first came out one of the \nmost powerful things was were these \nsummarization chains we also you know \nwe've been building on this General \nconcept of sequential chains you know \nlike where the name Lang chain comes \nfrom where you chain together other \nlanguage model calls such that the \noutput of the first call is the input to \nthe second call and so on summarization \nchains have been the most interesting \nkind of uh example of this so so \nprobably my favorite one is this refine \nidea this is probably the best way to \nsay summarize a podcast so you take each \nof the of the clips of the podcast and \nyou say write a summary you know you'll \nreceive these clips one at a time so it \nwrites this intermediate summary and \nthen it keeps taking the clips updating \nthat intermediate summary until \neventually it's looped through all the \npodcast clips and ends up with a final \nsummary there's also like this map \nre-rank and mapreduce I see these as \nreally interesting for say question \nanswering and I think this kind of \nrefine ideas really interesting for \nsummarization there's also an idea that \nI think originated in Lama index that \nwas like this um tree summarized so you \nsay line up all the text chunks you know \nin a list and then you kind of couple \nthem in twos and build up the tree with \nthe summary that way and you know \naggregate it to the top so but generally \nthis concept of you know applying These \nChains to summarize content and and then \nyou have this summary of content that \nyou could then say vectorize and build \nindexes with or use and you know that's \nkind of the question is okay now what do \nwe do with the summaries so this is also \nhighly related to the concept of \ngenerative feedback loops that we're \nreally heavily exploring at weviate this \nis the general concept of where we do \nthese retrieval augmented Generations we \nsend specific data from weviate to these \ngenerative models and then we save the \nresulting generation back in weeviate to \nthen maybe you know access for a future \nretrieval augmented generation or in \nthis case you know semantic search \nthrough the generated results so when we \nfirst published our blog post using \nAirbnb listing examples we were taking \nthe symbolic properties of the Airbnb \nlike you know how much it costs how many \nbedrooms it has and we took all that and \nwe synthesized a text description of it \nthat we would then index and search \nthrough so it's kind of a similar \nconcept to this summarization index you \nknow this idea of transforming data to \nfacilitate searching through it the next \nreally interesting idea and that's what \nthis paper is that's why I think this \npaper is so interesting is is kind of \nmarrying two different schools of \nthought and you know I love this when \nyou had there's some connection that you \nhadn't originally thought of is this \nidea of large language model generated \ndata for training search models so this \nis a picture from the in pairs paper \nyou take a document like we don't know a \nlot about the effects of caffeine during \npregnancy on you and your baby so it's \nbest to limit the amount you get each \nday so you know imagine you have this \nbig collection of text chunks it's like \nif you're building a tech search app \nwith weave that's probably like the \nsituation you find yourself in you \nprobably don't have these questions \nalready so you know having a query log \nalready is more of like a big company \nthing to already have this kind of \nestablished thing so you can do is you \ncan take the large language models and \ngenerate questions you know what are the \neffects of caffeine during pregnancy and \nthis document you know would say be the \nbest answer you have I don't know it's \nlike specific enough for this question \nbut like this this would be like a way \nto pass this into the language model \nprompt in some way to generate queries \nnow you have like query document pairs \nto you know either say compare the \nembedding models if you want to say you \nknow I don't want to use the open \nembedding models because it's 15 36 \nDimensions per you know vector and then \nI can't afford it's more expensive so I \nwant to use say the 384 dimensional \nembeddings from say the sentence \nTransformer DPR models you know and then \nso like you you want to ask these \nquestions of which embedding model \nshould I use but you don't have data to \nBenchmark this is a really interesting \nsolution to that to give you data to \nthen you know understand what the \ndifference in the models are going to be \nfor your search app and then also it's \ninteresting for training custom \nembedding models for your data which \nwould also probably give you better \nresults so two extremely interesting \nthings that you can do with this kind of \nllm generated search data so here's the \nmotivation behind the novel Insight \ninstead of generating specific queries \nthat match specific information we \ngenerate these abstract representations \nso for example a lot of these \ninformation retrieval data sets and then \nthe embedding models that are trained on \nthem like say they're trained on the \nsquad you know question answering data \nset it asks questions like what is the \natomic number of oxygen the answer is \neight or like what year did this King \nrule over you know France for and then \nit's like some specific date so most of \nthese data sets that have been created \nand you know published are like query \nand then like specific thing that comes \nout of the query rather than this kind \nof like abstract information need and \nthe authors motivate this by saying the \nuser is not interested in a definition \nor a single answer but for sentences \nwhose content is a specific \ninstantiation of their query I think \nthat this is a great quote because it's \nit's more in line with like this kind of \nsemantic search concept you're looking \nfor like you know semantic matches not \nlike specific matches to questions in \nthe thing so you know it's interesting \nthat if you're interested in this kind \nof thing there's also the set of \nembedding models called the instructor \nmodels where they're really digging into \nthe different information needs and it's \nquite an interesting topic but they give \nthis example of say you have this query \nsubstance abuse in animals right like \njust you know this kind of abstract \nquery \nthat would be a better match for the \nStudies have shown that a subpopulation \nof primates chronically consume \nintoxicating amounts of alcohol so it's \nlike this kind of query compared to \nsomething like which primate cons it has \nbeen found to show like and then it \nwould be like some specific kind of you \nknow species of it that kind of \ndifference in what these data sets look \nlike so another quote from the paper \njust sort of laying that out more \nexplicitly systems that are trained to \nretrieve passages that contain answers \nto questions for example train mostly on \nSquad and data sets like this Beyond \nbeing focused on questions rather than \nassertions are also focused on specific \nanswers rather than abstract situations \nso it's a you know it's a bit meta \ndigging into thinking about information \nneeds and information retrieval but I \nthink it makes a lot of sense you you \nknow usually with these kind of queries \nyou're like fuzzly looking for some kind \nof uh similar concept rather than the \nexact match to your question with the \nembedding model so digging further into \nthe paper this is the prompt that's \nbeing used to generate these valid and \ninvalid descriptions per sentence so we \nstart off with the main prompt of let's \nwrite abstract descriptions of sentences \nexample so so this is kind of the new \nthe structure of problems these days is \nyou start off with some description of \nthe task then you have a few shot \nexamples of what input output should \nlook like for the task so sometimes you \ncan omit this but generally you know \nI've done a few interviews with people \nabout you know who work on like agents \nin production this kind of thing and \ngenerally the consensus seems to be \nright now that keeping these few shot \nexamples of you know task descriptions \nor say how to use a tool is still quite \na productive thing to improve the \nperformance of the language model so you \nhave the sentence you know Pilates role \nin events leading to the crucifixion \nlent themselves to melodrama even \ntragedy and plotty often has a role in \nmedieval mystery plays so then you \ngenerate this abstract description a \ndescription of a historical religious \nfigure's involvement in a significant \nevent and it's later portrayal and art \nso you know you see how you blur out the \nspecific uh you know the specific \ndetails of the of the text and then you \ninstead have this abstract description \nof what the text is about so then in \naddition to the few shot exam apples you \nhave this kind of note to the language \nmodel and how to complete the task \ndescriptions can differ in the level of \nabstraction granularity and the part of \nthe sentence they focus on some \ndescriptions need to be abstract While \nothers should be concrete and detailed \nso then you have kind of the output \nprompt so you're saying for the \nfollowing sentence right up to five good \nand Standalone independent descriptions \nand five bad descriptions which may be \nrelated but are clearly wrong and then \nhere's another really interesting detail \nI'll put a Json file with keys good and \nbad so or get you know good comma bad \nbecause it like might even help a little \nbit more with the Json file but so this \ndetail is quite interesting because this \nis this concept of say you know \nLangston's recently released output \nparser output parser's camel case like \nthis concept of how do we make language \nmodels behave \nobey the kind of API syntax to then kind \nof chain out the outputs and you know \nparse them with say \nyou know just like just a basic kind of \npython parser for how you would take \nthis kind of output and then save each \nof the generations and then this kind of \nidea of using one prompt to generate 10 \nGenerations this way you can also \nimagine that there's some kind of cross \nattention across the 10 examples it's \ngenerating so it's kind of like listing \nout things it's a super interesting \nprompt and then you pass along the Chain \nby having it follow this structured \noutput so here's the next detailed paper \nthat I think is extremely interesting \nthey're going to take the output of the \nmain prompt and then feed it into the \nmake more abstract prompt so in my own \nexperiments of generating queries for \nthe podcast I've also thought of doing \nthis kind of thing where say you \ngenerate you know five queries and then \nyou have to ask it you know to take \nthose queries as input and then say you \nknow is this query specific to the \ndocument because you know it'll generate \nsome queries that like aren't specific \nto the document so that's kind of what \nI'd found in my little like how I've \nbeen investigating this a little bit \nso I think it's really interesting that \nthey're formalizing this make more \nabstracts prompt in this kind of prompt \nchaining with degenerative feedback loop \nfor the llm generated training data so \nwhat they do is out of the five valid \ndescriptions they're going to take each \none of them and they're going to \ngenerate three more from them by feeding \nthem into this next prompt so remember \nagain you have the Json file so you \nindex the Json file with the good keys \nand then you know you have so this new \nprompt so you have the sentence \ndescription pair and then you have a \nvery abstract description so again we \nhave this few shot example thing where \nwe're giving the large language model an \nexample of what we want this to look \nlike and then you know we roll with that \nwhere we plug in the sentence we plug in \nthe we plug in the original sentence we \nplug in the description the valid \ndescription that was generated in the \nyou know first thing and then we get a \nvery abstract description so it was a \nreally interesting way of kind of \nchaining this along and refining the \noutput of the um you know curating these \ndescriptions or summaries so here's \nanother really important detail of this \nthey do this at pretty large scale so if \nif you were skeptical about whether \nthese models would be any good you know \nwe're checking them out with say the \nsentence Transformers Library I think \nthis is a reason to be convinced to \ncheck them out so you know for each of \n165 960 Wikipedia sentences they \ngenerate five dollar descriptions and \nfive misleading descriptions so you know \ndoing the math that's like roughly like \n800 000 of each and then they are also \ngoing to do that and make more abstract \nprompt from you know three of seventy \nthousand so so for each of these you \nknow 165 \n000 roughly Wikipedia sentences they're \ngonna have you know five to eight \nadditional Pairs and then five \nmisleading pairs so is the train is um \nyou you have this kind of like local \ncomparison where that's the way they did \nthe metrics but so anyway so so it's \ninteresting to see the scale of it \nreally you know doing the million of \neach thing and you know doing that kind \nof scale it it's it's a large enough \nscale to think that these models would \nbe like quality zero shot embedding \nmodels of course then you you know could \nimagine scaling this up further further \nwith more Wikipedia sentences but it's \npretty interesting so quickly before we \neven dive further into the human study \nevaluation which is quite interesting in \nits own way let's quickly touch on how \nembedding models are trained just \nquickly in case you're not familiar with \nit basically you have this kind of \ntriplet loss or you have this info nce \nloss they're going to combine both of \nthem in multitask learning the way that \nyou do the triplet loss is you take the \nso this is the vector encoding of the \nanchor this is the vector encoding of \nthe positive Vector encoding of the \nnegative whereas with the batch negative \nyou Loop through the encodings of all \nthe other examples in the mini batch so \nyou know the way deep learning models \nare trained is you sample a batch of \ndata points and so with contrastive \nlearning info nce you you have your \nanchor and positive and maybe also you \nwould have a negative in there that you \ncould kind of mix of this but you could \nin so you have the anchor the positive \nand then just every other anchor \npositive pair that's in that mini batch \nis used as a negative and you know you \nLoop through and you take the you know e \nto the you know the distance and this is \nhow you do this kind of like \ndifferentiable loss function and scale \nit by doing this stuff like taking the \nlog of it and that kind of idea so \nwith the triplet loss you kind of like \nexplicitly compare two points you have \nthe margin hyper parameter that is you \nknow then plus the vector distance the \nso the L2 distance between the anchor \nand the positive vectors subtract that \nwith the distance between the anchor and \nthe negative and then you normalize it \nalso by having this large batch so this \nkind of law I think just the quick \ncommentary is like this kind of triplet \nloss thing this is pretty friendly this \nyou know not too ugly to train with \nwhereas this kind of info nce thing I \nthink this is a little more prohibitive \nwith people training embedding models \nbecause this is a bit more of a chaotic \nthing to orchestrate with how you have \nto like you know have this like diagonal \nmatrix to get the labels so this is \nwhere I think a lot of the the skill and \nthe expertise in training deep learning \nmodels comes in and yeah just sort of an \ninteresting detail if you're interested \nin you know exactly how the embedding \nmodels are optimized so here's another \npretty interesting detail of this paper \ninstead of reporting the performance on \nof their model on Ms Marco beer \nbenchmarks they're using a human study \nwith Mechanical Turk workers so you \nbegin by instructing the human \nthe workers about what the task is and \nSo you you're shown a description in 10 \nsentences you're asked to choose the \nfive most relevant descriptions so then \nwhat that ends up looking like is you \nknow a period of difficulty and sorrow \nfor an individual and then you choose \nyou know you rank the top five by \nchoosing five from this list to submit \nis which you think are the retrieve \nsentences that best fit this description \nso in the end you see that they chose \nthe new abstract Sim models you know on \nthe average they would choose 3.78 out \nof the five selected sentences whenever \nthey did a head-to-head comparison \nablating each of these two models \nagainst each other in like you know \ntournament style combinatorics so you \nknow you had pairs of abstract Sim 5 \nversus all MP net based V2 5 and you \nknow that made up to ten so each of \nthese two have been compared with each \nother five you know in this kind of \namount of times and then you see kind of \nthe bar chart the performance how many \ntimes it was chosen out of the 10 and \nshowing that you know these models \nperformed pretty well in the study so \nhere's some examples you know if you \nwant to go through it you see kind of \nthe difference in how \nhow it captures the specifics but you \nknow how it captures this kind of \nabstract concept with this new \ngeneration the kind of better results \nthat leads to some specific examples of \nthat if you want to dive into it so here \nare some final takeaways I had after \nreading this paper retrieving text based \non abstract description so firstly I'm \nthinking heavily about this kind of \nsummary index concept and I think that \nwhat we're seeing is the cost of large \nlanguage model inferences getting \ncheaper and cheaper such that this will \nbe something that's you know more common \nto do as we you know we're seeing all \nthese open source models I think Falcon \nbeing the latest one at the time of this \nrecording but this we're probably going \nto see cheaper and cheaper large \nlanguage model inference such that \nsummarizing all of your documents is \nmore of a you know economically sensible \nthing to do based on your app or \nwhatever you're building so it's very \ninteresting with this respect to custom \ndata for your document so I imagine a \nlot of weviate users have you know just \nthe documents and rather than the \nqueries because you're building kind of \nlike a new app you don't already have \nall this like user data in this kind of \nlog of query so so now I see there's \nkind of three things that you get out of \ndoing this llm generated data first you \nget the summary index you can use to \nkind of index the data to search through \nyou can also use then the original text \nand then these abstract descriptions and \nthen how well you're able to retrieve \nthe full text based on the abstract \ndescriptions to compare the performance \nof zero shot models and you can also use \nthat as data to train custom search \nmodels so kind of three use cases you \nget out of this llm generated data you \nbuild a summary index you can ablate the \ndifferent embedding models and then you \ncan maybe train your own custom models \nif you want to go for that so then I \nthink this General concept of summary \nindexes is super interesting for this \nconcept of top level indexing so you \nknow if I have a whole podcast I want to \nsummarize the whole podcast by doing \nthat create and refine summarization \nchain through each of the clips and then \nonce I find the podcast that matches my \nquery then I will search within the \npodcast so I'm just generally interested \nin that kind of phenomenon I didn't I \ndon't think it the paper particularly \nmade me think more I believe about this \nbut I just think it's something that's \nvery interesting so then there was \nanother paper that came out recently \nwhich was Voyager this Minecraft paper \nwhere you learn skills and then you \ninterestingly what they did also is that \nthey had an abstract description of the \nskill programs and that's what got \nindexed when they were retrieving so \nit's just an interesting thing of how \nyou would summarize some kind of really \nabstract thing to then index the summary \nof the thing and Vector search cross \nsummaries I think is really interesting \nso maybe something that's just like an \nidea is maybe we could retrieve with \nabstract descriptions and then apply \nthese re-rankers like cross encoders to \nthe original full text as an idea and \nthen another thing is I just think this \nkind of how do we judge the quality of \nthese llm generated descriptions I think \nthis is quite an interesting topic so \nwith respect to this last point of how \ndo we judge description quality we VA \nPodcast 48 I had the pleasure of \ninterviewing Professor Laura Dietz and I \nlove this paper perspectives and large \nlanguage models for relevance judgments \nand I think it's really interesting to \nrelate to this so you know what we \npreviously had you know human judgment \nthis you know like with say like the \nTrek benchmarks for information \nretrieval like humans would just you \nknow annotate the relevance of queries \nor say like you know we would divide up \nour team so everyone on our team writes \n10 queries for each of our like \ndocumentation or something like this in \norder to Benchmark our search systems \nnow we say have ai assistance where we \nuse the you know the llm generated \nsummary of the document then we have \nlike a human filtering layer where the \nhumans like look at the output and kind \nof rate them or maybe we do just like \ndifferent tasks generally I think \nanother interesting idea is two llms \neach generated judgment and a human \nselects the better one so this is kind \nof similar to me to the make a more \nabstract prompt where you say take the \noriginal five valid descriptions and \nthen you generate three more you could \nalso Imagine an intermediate layer there \nwhere the LM takes the five generated \ndescriptions and says you know you can \nonly take three which of the three you \nknow best abstract summaries of this \ncontent that kind of idea of like \nchaining away with the language model \nand so \nyou know it's just like a really \ninteresting you know the times and thing \nthis whole spectrum of how we're \nthinking about using large language \nmodels to you know annotate say query \ndocument pairs relevance or say also \njudge the quality of generated text this \nis like a problem as old as generative \nmodeling is how do you judge the quality \nof generated images of generated text \nand so with images we had things like \nthe freshay score Inception distance for \nsay like Gans and now with text it's \nlike when you write a summary of uh you \nknow some text how are you gonna you \ncan't like what they have now is like \nRouge scores blue spelled b-l-e-u scores \nwhich is like engram overlap to some \nhuman annotated gold summary of the text \nso it's like how are we going to be \nannotating this kind of abstract \ndescription so I really enjoyed this \npaper and I think this is this is \nanother interesting perspective on llm \ngenerated data that we can use for \nsearch so one more thing before wrapping \nup I'm working on a new demo of abstract \ndescription summarization indexes using \nthe dog fooding of the Wii VA podcast \ntranscription so if you haven't seen all \nthis project already please check it out \nand stay tuned for generative feedback \nloops part two exploring generated \nsummaries for each of these podcast \nclips and the summaries of the podcast \nthemselves exploring writing \npersonalized summaries of the podcast \nfor different people writing biographies \nof people based on the podcast content \nand also say automatically finding \nchapters from the podcast by prompting \nit so exploring further how we can use \nlarge language models to transform our \ndata and then save that transform data \nback into our database for some kind of \nfuture purpose thank you so much for \nwatching this paper summary video of \nretrieving texts based on abstract \ndescriptions please subscribe to the \nchannel for more content around you know \nVector surge retrieval augmented \ngeneration approximate nearest neighbor \nsearch and all these cool topics please \ncheck out check out weaviate at weeviate \nIO or open source on GitHub at wegate \nweeviate and follow us on Twitter at \nweeviate IO thanks again
