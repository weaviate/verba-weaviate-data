{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the 62nd Weaviate Podcast with Atai Barkai! We are stepping into the meta with ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching the wevia podcast I'm super \nexcited to host a Thai barkai co-founder \nof talk it AI which has created podcast \ngbt I you know personally for me the \nkind of dog fooding of using this we V8 \npodcast the transcriptions that I get \nfrom whisper and putting that into \nweviate and using that to prototype \nthese retrieval augmented generation llm \nVector database apps it's been so much \nfun for me so I'm you know so excited \nfor this conversation I love diving into \nwhat we can do with podcasts kind of the \nfuture of podcasting with large language \nmodels and generally how you know I love \nlike hearing like-minded people who are \ncurious about this kind of application \nso firstly it's Ty thank you so much for \njoining the wevia podcast glad to be \nhere Connor and yeah I checked out your \nuh weavia podcast GitHub and it's very \ncool yeah where we're at it's a great \nthing to dog food \nthank you that means the world to me I I \nmean the it may be first before diving \ninto the GitHub and maybe telling you a \nbit about some of the projects that I've \ndone sort of Lessons Learned let me like \nif you you could tell us about you know \nhow you see the space and what motivated \nyou to get into this yeah so talk at AI \nis building an llm native audio video \ndatabase \num so kind of a layer in between Vector \ndatabases and relational databases and \nthe individual file analysis \num so transcription the organization all \nthat stuff \num and are kind of uh breakthrough \nproduct \num is a consumer product uh we kind of \nhave our own design partner um for the \nuh database component it's called \npodcastgbt.ai \num which just launched in Alpha about a \nmonth ago uh and it's basically \num you know have \nAI listen to all your podcasts \num find the most interesting parts for \nyou uh and then send those to any \npodcast app um so obviously yeah like \nthe big thing that shifted with language \nmodels is the computer can actually \nunderstand what people are talking about \nright it's no longer just keywords um \nand that just opens the possibility to \nto do search to do you know semantic \nsearch not keyword search but you're \nlooking for type of content or content \nabout something and you can actually \nfind it and you can know how high \nquality is it how relevant how \ninteresting \num so how relevant to your other \ninterests so so there's a lot you can do \nnow that wasn't possible before \nyeah I mean and yeah I think that's \nperfectly it is it's kind of what I'm \nyou know hoping we can hash out in this \nconversation is you know further \nexploring what's possible now that \nwasn't possible before when I came \nacross podcast gbt and reached out to \nyou because I was really curious to talk \nto you I one thing was um you know this \nkind of like interactive experience like \nchat with podcasts that you chat with \nyour data chat with PDF chat with \npodcasts like can you tell me how you \nsee that kind of like interactive \nexperience with podcast listening yeah \nso actually it's interesting because the \nconsumer product uh you know consumers \ndon't care about the technology they \ncare about the experience uh and \npodcasting is a very interesting medium \num because so first of all I don't know \nif you know this worldwide there's \nroughly two billion hours of podcasts \nlistening uh per month which is a lot \nright there's only eight billion people \non the planet \num and uh and it's generally it's very \ndifferent kind of consumption from what \npeople do on you know Tick Tock or \nTwitter it's long form uh you know \nroughly every session is on average 23 \nminutes long uh which makes sense to all \nof us right while you commute while we \nwant \num \nso people really kind of want to start \npressing something and then not worry \nabout it uh so the interactive component \nis very very interesting in outside of \npodcast consumption right to build tools \nuh for podcasters to build maybe like a \njust a plain search engine uh but when \nyou think about just plain podcast \nconsumption you actually want to go as \nfar away from possible from uh \ninteractivity and actually the direction \nwe took this to \num is we don't even have our own app we \nactually did start having our nap \num but uh what we figured out is really \nkind of the intelligence is the product \nhere and there's no reason to try to \nmove \num people over from their habit right \npeople have habits formed over years \nthey use this app the process app for \nyears \nwhat's the minimum way that we can \naugment uh that experience without \nasking the user for anything so so the \nbasically kind of the interface we came \nup with is uh all the podcasts are built \non top of uh this open protocol called \nRSS \num and yeah not many people know this \nbut even you know apple and Spotify uh \nthey don't actually host the content or \nanything they just you tell them here's \nwhere my podcast lives and then they \nkind of redisplit \num so we can put up our own podcast for \nyou \num that is looks the same to that \npodcast application it's just one more \nRSS feed uh except the contents inside \nof it can now be \num essentially Clips but long form Clips \nright not so not two minutes but you \nknow 15 minutes 20 minutes \num from maybe what was a three hour long \nepisode uh and we can deliver that to \nyou right away and also tell you what's \ninside of that clip why you should watch \nthat clip right uh so it's very specific \num so so yeah that's how we think about \nthis from the perspective of plain \nconsumer product for podcast consumption \nuh but of course when you start to think \nabout \ntools for podcasters which is I think \none of the obvious applications of \nhaving you know audio database then then \nthe interactivity starts to become a lot \nmore important \num \nand then on our side that interactivity \nis mostly on the back end side all right \nwe kind of figure out okay what are your \ninterests \num based on what you tell us right now \nactually we're going to add Twitter \ncrawling soon so you can just you know \nsee what your ideas are \num and then surface things are really \nkind of hyper targeted uh for you uh in \nthis long form world \nyeah well there a lot of really \ninteresting ideas in there I love the \nkind of um I guess kind of the first one \nof the earlier things you were \ndescribing is that kind of syncing up of \nthe clip recommendation clip extraction \nkind of with apple podcast with Spotify \nand how you can unify these interfaces I \ndo think that's a really powerful topic \nlike \num you know with review like sometimes \nwhen I think about this weeva podcast \nand that kind of demo project I think \nabout like maybe integrating this on the \nWii v8.io website so like and you know I \nbuild my clip kind of recommendation but \nI do think what you're describing is \nprobably the more likely uh future for \nthis of that kind of personalization is \nmanaged by some kind of platform almost \nlike sub stack how you have like an \nemail list but I think kind of just \ngenerally it's like the \nlike the evolution of these email lists \nthey become more like a CRM for you \nwhere it like keeps information about \nyou know why particularly you would want \nto watch this this podcast clip and I \nthink yeah if we can maybe stay on that \nuh like hyper personalization of podcast \nrecommendation yeah I think like just \nkind of like using the language models \nto take the podcast clip take some \nbiography from a person or or even yeah \nI I loved what you said about the \nTwitter that kind of like data data \nconnection is is a super powerful thing \nso yeah maybe if you could just tell me \na little more about how you see like you \nknow personalizing it uh you know how \nhow exactly is that completely new with \nthe language models and all this yeah \nyeah so I mean really before you even \ncan get to personalization \num on the if you think about the \nintelligence kind of pyramid uh that's \nkind of the personalization is the very \ntip of the of the pyramid um there's a \nlot of work you have to do beforehand \num so obviously basically like the first \nsteps is transcription getting the you \nknow what the words that are being said \nand diarization which uh not as many \npeople know the stone but it's who said \nwhat right so it's not you these these \nwords were said but this person said \nthat you know I'm saying these words \nyou're gonna say words later \num so that's kind of your basic \nfundamental building block um but then \nthe really interesting part uh and by \nthe way that you know and there's been \nmassive \num advancements uh in the last year you \nknow uh open ai's whisper uh and Whisper \ntwo uh are just you know it's open \nsource it's free you can run it on your \nown gpus and it's kind of significantly \nbetter than anything that existed \num up until that point uh nowadays you \nknow even more competition which is \ngreat but like we're really starting to \nget to the very very tip like \ntranscription is almost solved not quite \nthere's still you know \num \nniches that they need to be uh solved \nand obviously it's not necessarily 100 \nperfect but overall you get very good \nquality \num diarization is is still not quite at \nthe same level but you can \num get very very close to \nPerfection uh especially with the aid of \nkind of a language model \nto sanity check uh like does it make \nsense that all of a sudden this sentence \nwas said by somebody else like maybe not \nokay yeah uh we can kind of uh \nuse the intelligence there to straighten \nthat out so but once you have this \ndiarized transcript \nthe really interesting part is \num coming up with a hierarchy of \nsegments \num because you have essentially you know \nif you think about a podcast especially \nright because these things tend to be \npretty long \num you have uh you know maybe a \n30-minute segment that is \nkind of an arch right that or an arc \nthat gets covered and then inside of it \nit might be about five minute and seven \nminute and eight minutes that kind of \nare even more pointed to a specific \nDirection so you want to be able to find \nthis uh hierarchy \num of segments and that is really it's a \nvery interesting problem \num it's not trivial you can kind of do \nit in a recursive way a lot of the \ntechniques that work \num if you find the small segments if you \nkind of zoom out you can use them to \nfind the bigger segments \num so uh \nso that's very interesting and over \nthere there's actually in our experience \nwhat works what tends to work best has \nto do with embeddings uh so kind of a \ngood entry point to the \num Vector database and we can talk about \nthat but then once you've gotten all of \nthis stuff so now we have a coherent \nsegment that is you know 25 minutes long \num now you gotta match the segment \nwith a person uh and right so like if \nthere's a three hour long podcast maybe \nI'm really into uh you know my \nbackground before uh Tech is physics \nright so if somebody's talking about uh \ninterpretations of quantum mechanics \nthat's really interesting to me maybe \nit's not very interesting to you so how \ndo I map this segment to me and to you \nmaybe a segment about \num I don't know if any something else \nthat you're \nuh into and and and there it's actually \nit's a very interesting one I think it's \nan open bar I think we're going to see a \nlot of advancements uh in that realm the \nmost trivial thing you can do again has \nto do with embeddings right like what \nwhat type of things belong in your \ncluster of things \num and obviously just traditional \nranking personalized ranking like you \nsee but I think what's really \ninteresting \nwith language models \num \nis that this type of ranking can \nactually now rely on the content on \nwhat's inside of \num the content rather than you know kind \nof proxies of user interests like who's \nclicking what \num and if you think about you know what \nnews feeds look like a lot of the times \nnowadays you can tell they're really \noptimizing for the clicks but it's it's \nboth a conscious kind of choice maybe \nbut also they really don't have much \nbetter to do like how are you going to \nknow if this video is good or not if you \ndon't know what's inside of it uh you \nkind of have to rely on clicks but if \nyou can now uh look inside of the \ncontent \nthat gives you a whole new dimension uh \nto uh rate content by uh which is \nespecially important for you know \nlong-form content where people you know \nthey really want to be engaged for the \nduration of their Drive their walk uh \nit's not good enough to click bait them \nuh so uh yep \nyeah firstly I'm glad I you know you \nsometimes when I take notes when I'm \ndoing a podcast I only have one piece of \npaper but I just did like half of my \npaper on what you just said so \nit was really great I you know I kind of \nbeginning with that um diarization \nwhisper having that integrated in the \nsame platform that then does the llm \npersonalization I yeah I believe \nstrongly in that I you know right now I \nhave like a collab notebook that my \nwhisper goes into personally I've cut \nwell I'm also kind of not necessarily \nworking on this all the time but I've \nkind of given up on diarization because \nyou know for me it's like um labeling I \nyou know whisper doesn't give you the \ndiarization and I haven't maybe someone \nwants a link to it and it'll just solve \nmy problem right away but like I've just \nI've just decided to just chunk the text \nas you mentioned like the llm can sanity \ncheck like does it make sense for this \ncup that actually I think works pretty \nwell and they just scale yeah and that \nscale is nicer for me to just get all \nthese podcasts in there quickly and yeah \nso I believe strongly with that my other \nthing kind of with a platform that does \nthis is like for me my whisper will \ntranslate like weediate to wv-8 you know \nyeah yeah yeah and so these kind of \nthings are like kind of a problem for \nthen you know like an embedding that is \nlike you know uh you know like yeah I \ncan imagine these little transcription \nerrors are kind of problematic for these \ninformation specific podcasts like our \npodcast particularly is going to be \nabout like you know we usually really \ndive into it on Vector databases and so \nit's like you know those little \ntranscription errors but \nso then we so then talking about kind of \npersonalization again is um this kind of \nlike I love this separation as you \nmentioned like the popularity bias being \ntoo strong and we've yet we have this \nthing called reftubec where it's like \nthis is like one of the Demos in that \nGitHub repository too where it's like \nConor and then I interact with like four \npodcast clips and this is something like \nthat you know is just going viral on \nTwitter is somebody discovering this \nthat averaging these embeddings actually \nlike produces a pretty nice Vector in \nthe middle of it I'm just so surprised \nwhen I started playing with this but you \nknow just averaging those four clips \nthat the embedding of those four Clips I \nliked just using that then is the search \nVector yeah and then yeah that kind of \nranking stuff you know we just did like \nan integration with coheres re-ranking \nmodels and that takes his input like the \nyou know the the query and the document \nand replacing the query with like a user \nbiography and so maybe first search yeah \nyeah I think all that's so powerful but \nkind of the so the you know this in my \nnotes that I'm replying but the the one \nthing that you said that I really want \nto get more thoughts on is that \nhierarchy of segments I've never heard \nthat before so that like you know like a \nmoment and I've you know I've been \nplaying with summarization chains it is \nlike this idea where it's like the \nprompt is like you will receive the \nclips one by one as well as the local \nsummary so far or the local list of \nchapters so far and you just you know \nbut that kind of idea of maybe having \nlike a topic modeling where you you know \nyou have the latency the embeddings of \nall the clips and then you cluster those \nclips and then you know you have like \nhierarchical topic modeling yeah can you \njust tell me more about how you see that \nperspective of yeah hierarchy of \nsegments I think there's definitely \nsomething to that yeah yeah so I mean I \nthink it's really interesting for like \nit's it's um well first actually I mean \nit's all kind of related the the and I \nwould I would also love to hear we could \ndo this later your theorization uh take \nbecause that's uh that's interesting for \nus actually the arization \nuh which surprised me uh significantly \nboosted performance of the rest of the \nchain \num and I I suppose it might be a you \nknow we did I didn't try to do just \nllm guest sterization maybe that would \nhave been good enough \num but if you just compare to the plain \ntranscript \num it really made a big difference to \nthe rest of the chain \num and you can kind of see it yourself \nif you if you yourself just look at a \ntranscript with theirization without \num it's much easier to understand what's \nactually happening um with this little \npiece of information \num but on the on the \num hierarchy of segments \num \nso what's interesting actually with ref \nto Vector I don't know if you saw Yohe \nlike of a baby AGI Fame like he he did \nhe posted a tweet that is uh an \naveraging of all the embeddings of his \ntweets and then back to text uh and it's \nreally interesting to see what the \nresult of that was \num and uh \nwhat you can tell is that the kind of \nhighest order bit \nis style to some extent uh it looks like \nright you cannot mistake that text that \ncame out for something other than a \ntweet uh it's a tweet by a techie right \nit's like kind of like so so that's the \nfirst kind of highest order bit to some \nextent that gets maintained there \num so the way we think about \num transcription and honestly uh \nsorry not your screenshot but \nsegmentation \num \nis you're trying to find \nthe flow of topics right the thing that \nrepresents a flow of topics the best is \nan embedding \nbut \nyou want uh you want to kind of lose the \nstylistic parts \num when you try to figure out \nthe flow of topics so we the first thing \nwe do before we we look at embeddings is \nwe uh kind of normalize \nthe segments that we're looking at to to \nbe of a uniform style to some extent so \nwe say okay let's summarize what's \nhappening in this clip from kind of this \nthird person perspective so hey this \nperson talked about this they brought \nthat up like rather than just have that \nplain embedding of what was said \ndirectly \num and and what we found is that when \nyou do that then when you look at \nembedding uh distances \nthat tells you when actually topics have \nshifted so um a strategy that we that we \nuse is we basically embed we take all \nthese segments we chunk them up \nwe normalize them we embed the \nnormalized text \nand then we compare the embedding \ndistance between a chunk \nand the preceding chunk \num and and we actually do this for the \ntwo previous predecessors right so you \nsee okay like if you have all this array \nof segments essentially \num you look how essentially you're \nasking how different is this segment \nfrom the segment right before it and \nfrom the segment right the previous \nbefore and before before right and then \num \nwhat you see is when you find uh \nwhen when you you look at all of these \nfor the entire podcast the spikes \nin embedding distance \ncorrespond to topic changes to to \nessentially segmentations and and you \ncan do this uh when you do this with uh \nsegments that represent very short \nsegments then you get \nthe shorter segments \nbut you can repeat the same exact \nprocess \nwith a longer segments right so let's \nsay now you've found okay here is one \nshort segment now let's take which \nconsisted of a lot of these kind of you \nknow micro segments right so now let's \ntake this we summarize this we normalize \nthat uh and you can repeat the same \nprocess again and now you see okay these \nall these these four segments that are \neach you know five minutes long \nthey make a coherent segment that is you \nknow 25 minutes long uh because there's \nthis Arc change that happens you know \nthat \num I don't know if that made sense it's \nkind of uh oh yeah that sounds I mean \nit's I think uh kind of firstly that \nkind of like normalized the Style by \nmaking it like kind of I read this one \npaper that's called uh like retrieving \ntexts based on abstract descriptions and \nso you take like a podcast clip and you \nprompt the language model to yeah like \njust just make the content normalize the \nstyle that's yeah that's a really \ninteresting kind of thing and you know \nas you mentioned just looking at the \nembedding distance to detect topic \nchange that that could be a huge cost \nsaver compared to having the language \nmodel go through it and and yeah \nobviously I love any kind of application \nof embeddings but like um yeah really my \nyou know my curiosity as we were talking \nis going into this like multi-discourse \ntopic this is like you know you you are \ntrying to embed a chunk of text that \ntalks about multiple things like I think \nkind of as the tie kicked off this \npodcast we had a lot of speaker turns \nthat mentioned multiple things like it \nwould be like you know whisper \ndiurization ref devec and ranking like \nall in the same kind of clip and so what \nkind of happens with embeddings is like \nan embedding for just that you know \nmulti-topic thing is doesn't really work \nall that well so \nyeah what you're saying I'm trying to \nI'm trying to come up with a good \nquestion to follow up with it but that \nkind of like you know separating out the \ntopics I think that is definitely a \npowerful thing for just um \nprobably like text chunking in general \nprobably for anyone building any kind of \napplication with Vector databases they \nshould be thinking about something to do \nwith that I mean maybe you \nyeah I don't know maybe I mean and then \nI really like what you're saying about \nhow you would try to then tie all the \ntopics that you decompose into one big \ncoherent thing yeah is it this is kind \nof my first time hearing this so I'm I'm \nsorry if I'm not like quick enough to \ncome up with like a good reflection to \nit but that kind of uh yeah it's \num \nobviously this is uses use case \ndependent but for podcasts where \nit's people speaking right it's not you \nknow a lot of text that is natively text \nis kind of by default very structured \nyou know if you look at archive \ndocuments they all kind of look the same \nthey have the same style \num so \nyou can kind of get away without doing \nany type of normalization because it's \nalready normalized by whoever wrote the \nthing in the first place but when you \nlook at just conversation free-flowing \nconversation \num then uh \nyeah if you know the example you said \ninitially we started talking about okay \nabiate and uh Lambda index and all these \nthings if we just look at the embeddings \nfor that that will now connect to some \nother time that we said lamendix \num very strongly but if you first \nsummarize this then the summary would be \nwell a Thai encounter uh discussed at a \nhigh level like \na few uh llm Technologies including you \nknow we V8 and lime addicts and so on \nand so forth so so now that's a very \ndifferent thing to embed \num because Now it connects to \nsummarization right so maybe we also in \nthe beginning of the podcast we \ndiscussed at a high level some other \nthings right we also discussed at a high \nlevel what talk at AI does so so now \nthese two things connect whereas maybe \nthey wouldn't have before we normalize \nit \num so for me for you know for kind of \nfree form content the step of embedding \nis almost \nnecessarily tied to some type of \nnormalization by the language model to \nbegin with \num in order again if you talk about kind \nof a longer chunk of content uh that \nyou're trying to relate to other long \ntypes uh long chunks of content \nyeah I think that's absolutely brilliant \nthat's the first time I've well I I've \nI've been studying this problem of like \ndomain generalization and deep learning \nlike you train an image classifier on \nclipart and it can't generalize to \nphotorealistic images or sketches like \nunderstanding the confounding impact of \nstyle on deep learning models and yeah \nthis just really helped a click for me I \nmean I love that summary index the idea \nthat you use the LMS to summarize \nsomething in the embedding of the \nsummary ends up creating better search \num yeah so I thought that was really a \nreally interesting conversation topic \nlet's um if we could pivot I love also \ntalking about how can we make podcasting \nmore interactive kind of the long form \nmake it more interactive I'm curious \nwhat your thoughts are on that \nyeah \num it's it's a tough one honestly so we \nwe actually \num \ngot to this world in a very convoluted \nway we started just with podcasts \num not with AI actually more it's kind \nof social \num podcasting and uh and you know \nthere's a bunch of of companies that \nstarted out around the same time \num and basically none of them made it \nand it's because like there's something \nwhen you start to like really look at \npodcasts this world of podcasting I mean \nwhat works really well in this world \nis obviously tons of consumption right \ntwo billion hours a month that's a lot \num \na lot of by a lot of people right so \nit's it's pretty Universal in the US \nsomething like a third of of adults \nlisten to uh our weekly podcast as soon \nas they list on average to two to three \nhours a week so so that's quite a lot \nlike it's it's pretty variable so the \nthing that is broken \nis distribution right so people \ngenerally have \num four to five podcasts they kind of \nkeep track of \nuh and then they It's All or Nothing \nconsumption anything that's outside of \nthese four or five Pockets it will never \neven get the chance to enter their \nsphere \num and if you and it's also All or \nNothing at the level of the episode \nbecause you have this you know two three \nhour long episodes oftentimes \nand unless you listen to the whole thing \nyou will never hear the 30 minutes in \nthe middle \num and and that's just really hard to \nsolve um because again it's kind of it's \na multitasking medium uh right in its \nnative form like these two billion hours \nof consumption people consume pockets in \nother places too right on Tick Tock \nthat's a lot there's Autumn it's from \npodcasts that go viral but but that's a \nvery different mode of consuming this \ncontent which is also important \num \nfor spread especially but \num \nbut if you look up just plain podcast \nconsumption it's generally a \nmultitasking medium uh so people consume \nit while they're walking their dog while \nthey're exercising \num and interactivity is really hard \nthere because you're you know screen off \nit's kind of like a screen off medium \num \nwhich is why it can be long form by the \nway that's in itself pretty interesting \nyou know because every other medium in \nour lives is pulling to shorter and \nshorter and shorter right like so \nYouTube videos went to tick tocks right \nso if I'm like 10 minutes long to now a \nminute long right that's kind of the \naverage uh text went from blog posts to \ntweets right so most media kind of pull \ntoo short for them but but if you but \npodcast because it's a multitasking \nthing you know if you imagine in your \nmind walking and listening to One Minute \none minute one minute like that sounds \nlike hell \num so it's like the long form is what \nworks and then that kind of comes hand \nin hand with not as much interactivity \nuh so the question is when you want to \nadd interactivity \nwhat where are the entry points that you \ncan do that \num easily uh or that kind of that \ncorrespond to user habits and user \npreferences \num and I think so so there's like a few \nplaces that I mean first of all like \njust podcast is just a wealth of \nknowledge \nuh that is really fascinating that \nin a form that is really easy to consume \nuh so better integration with search you \nknow you search for something on Google \nyou find text probably there is some \nfive-minute click from a podcast if \ndepending on your topic that will be \nlike much much better for you to like \nget then \num \nthen then a blog post that's talking \nabout it but you'll get the blog post \nyou won't get this five minute segment \nso \num so so that's one place to add \ninteractivity \num and then on the consumption side \nthere's there's a lot of things \nuh \ntwo we can talk about but maybe I'll \npause it there so but I I think yeah I \nlove that everything you said about kind \nof how you consume podcasts like for me \nyou know I think that two to three hours \nis probably about accurate and you just \nlike for me personally I'm sure it's \naccurate for everyone but like you know \nI usually am kind of tired from work or \ncoding and something so it's more like \nI'm yeah walking around or like playing \na video game and that's more the \nexperience and so when I think about \nthat kind of like uh clip recommendation \nthing I think maybe one way it could \nwork is like you listen to Connor and \nit's high talking about this and then \nmaybe they are some llm with a voice \nnarrator that says like you know and now \nhere's a clip from machine learning \nStreet Talk where they also talk about \nthis topic and maybe that's one way to \nbuild the experience where you have some \nlike intermediate narrator that's really \nlike an llm with a voice clip thing but \nyou know something that you ended the \nconversation with uh your speaking turn \nas it did the podcast thing about it \nlike transitions but \num this uh like the the information \nvalue of pod guest Clips like you \nmentioned whether you Google search for \na topic whether you would want to be \nbrought to you know a medium article a \nYouTube video an archive paper or a \npodcast clip and I think the podcast \nclip \nlike it adds that it's kind of like when \nyou're at maybe like a spelling bee when \nyou're like could you use it in a \nsentence I don't know why that would \nhelp you spell it better but like if the \nif the task instead of spelling it was \nlike what's the meaning of it right like \nI feel like that kind of like \nconversational context of something like \nyou know like one of my favorite \nprojects is building this like you know \nllama index has this like uh query \nrouter across different indexes so I \nhave the blog post the podcast \ntranscriptions and then I have the wevia \ncode base and so I feel like if it's if \nyou're talking about like what is \nreftubec there's there's definitely a \ncleaner in the blog post or the code \ndocumentation but there's something to \nthat like how they used in conversation \nkind of right like it's kind of like a \nit has like a unique information value \nto it \nand that kind of brings me the question \nI wanted to ask about is it's it's like \nlike these podcasts it's almost like a \nsport like you and I are right now like \nthink about like what are we gonna say \nnext how am I going to react to What a \ntie is going to say and so I to me it's \nkind of like this like post-game \nanalysis almost like I'd like I love \nlike the interview study kind of papers \nI think like that is also something \npowerful it's like how do you go from \nlike a podcast into kind of a blog or \nsomething that's more curated and more \nlike a reflection of these things \nyeah \num sorry can you say that like just the \nlast part again so so the like \nsometimes like just as an anecdote I \nremember when I started the weba podcast \nand I had this conversation with Han \nZhao the CEO of uh Gina Ai and he like \njust gave me this massive tour of neural \nsearch and I was like this should be \nlike a survey paper there was like this \nshould be like an academic survey but \nthere was so much to it so like I feel \nlike they're even like our conversation \nnow is like how do we go from like all \nthese topics we talk about kind of like \ntranscribing it and then I feel like \nalso kind of turning it into the written \nartifact as well could be an opportunity \nfor this stuff yeah yeah I know for sure \nit's it's uh there's definitely if you \nlook at the content that is kind of \nright now hidden inside of audio and \nvideo \nand it is hidden right because for the \nmost part these are opaque files they \nlive in a hardware assignment where and \nuh when they do get surfaced for you \nthey it's very non-granular they they \nkind of here is a video that you know is \nrelevant for this but okay it's an hour \nlong wait where right \num and uh \nyeah so I think there's a lot of \ninteresting things of just \nputting this uh a plain textual form uh \nand it seems like it's getting closer \nand closer to actual reality \num and then uh on the other side it's \nalso very interesting to kind of uh \nyou know there's this trend that's \nhappening outside of podcasts and of \npersonalization of content right like \nyou \nthe \nyou know there's the South Park episode \nthat went viral that got generated by \nthe LM so you know people you can have a \nSouth Park episode generated just for \nyou that nobody else watches like I \nthink things will probably start to get \nmore and more to that place probably not \nliteral personalization at first but \nmore kind of the long tail of content so \nhere's like a segment of people that you \nknow before it wouldn't make sense to \nmake content just for them \num \nhow do you start \nto do that now that it's much cheaper to \ncreate content \num and uh I think one of the biggest \nchallenges there and in general with \nllms \nis this kind of like uh \nMirage of like we're almost at 100 right \nwho almost can do the whole thing by \nitself and then what you can find is \nthat pretty consistently you can if the \nLM can do it at all you can get to like \n80 90 percent like pretty quickly like \nright you're not gonna get like 30 like \nif it can do it at all like you can get \nit to 80 90 but then the last 10 percent \nis really difficult \num to get and you know we kind of saw \nthis with self-driving cars where they \nkind of got really really good really \nreally fast and it's like okay next year \nthat's full self driving next year next \nyear and it's like still not here \nobviously with progresses continue to be \nmade maybe it will be here in five years \num so but but that's something I'm \nthinking about in terms of plain you \nknow if if you're trying to actually \ncompete on articles right like somebody \nonce you read your article for Real uh \nrather than something else then I think \nthat the human augmentation is really \nthe most uh interesting place where you \ncan maybe take the podcast episode and \nnot literally put a blog post up but you \ncan do 90 of the work and then if this \nis interesting enough a human comes in \nthe loop and like finishes it up \nbasically \num for consumption so that so that's \nsomething that could be uh very \ninteresting \nyeah that I mean that's that's perfect I \nwas like I was kind of disappointed when \nI was when I ran my summarization of \nthese podcasts experiments because yeah \nlike it what it'll do is it'll like \nespecially that sequential summarization \nchain it'll collapse the topics into \nlists because it like doesn't really \nunderstand what I'm talking about with \nweavia and like maybe just like as if \nanyone's interested in like what I'm \nworking on out right now I'm kind of \nI've gotten really into the LM fine \ntuning thing and you know particularly \nwe're building this model called gorilla \nbut like I'm starting to learn more \nabout it you know Samsung has helped me \na ton with sub strategies like we V8 \nlisteners are curious about anyways but \nlike I agree really strongly with this \nlike um I think we need to fine tune the \nllms to get that 90 to 100 like \nyou know for the for I don't think just \nthe gbt4 API well I don't know though \nit's so interesting I hear so many \nperspectives on this and and it's like \nthis has been I always this topic comes \nup on every single web podcast right \nwhether you need to fine-tune models or \nespecially now as retrieval augmented \ngeneration is emerging like you know \nwhen I as I talk about like sometimes my \nfrustration with these summarizations of \npodcasts is that it'll just like \ncollapse the thing into a list \nso so it'll have like multiple topics \nlike it'll be like you know Connor and \nAlexa first discovered uh talked about \nthis you know they described this thing \nlike and so like it captures the keyword \nand then it has some some sentence that \nsummarizes the topic that makes some \nsense and then like on the next step it \njust boom collapse all that into just a \ncommon separated list and the last topic \nsorry that wasn't too clear but but \nreally so so basically you're asking it \nto go from the transcript to uh a text \narray like a comma separated array of uh \nso I'm trying to capture like this \nsummer you know like I my goal kind of \nwas like can I automate the task of \npublishing a podcast of which I always \nlike write a description and then I cut \nup the chapters and as it was writing \nthe description it would you know it \nwould just collapse the because it's got \nthe it goes you will receive the clips \none at a time as well as the summary so \nfar and then you inject the summary so \nfar and then the next then you Loop \nthrough each of the clips and so the \nsummary so far will be like you know \nthey just they discussed this topic then \nthey discuss this topic and with the \ndescription of the topics and then it \nwill just boom comma separated list of \nof just the keywords that describe the \ntopic but anyways I I think I'm getting \na little distracted from our main \nconversation topics but basically my \nconclusion is like I'm I'm very curious \nabout what fine-tuning LMS are going to \nlook like even though I'm still on the \nfence like I am working on this but I \nthink like it also could be the case \nthat just retrieval augmented generation \ncould retrieve more background on each \nof the keywords and avoid the collapse \nthat way so I don't know what the what \nthe conclusion is going to be but it's a \nlot of fun supporting it but let me kind \nof come back into one of the things we \nwere just talking about which is this \nsocial component to podcasting I think \nit's very interesting like as an example \nI really like Ben morica's data exchange \npodcast and I think one thing that would \nbe interesting is like you know we there \nevery now and then we have the same \nguess like um you know he talked to \nJerry Lou I also had Jerry Lou on this \npodcast and it's like uh like I would be \nvery interested in like what did Ben ask \nJerry that I I didn't or you know if I \nimagine any you could compare any two \npodcasts like this it's maybe more \ninteresting for me personally because \nlike I was in the podcast but like you \nknow that kind of like comparison of \npodcast and maybe share a guess and it's \nlike what did they uniquely talk about \nthat's kind of where I see the social \nangle going \nyeah yeah for sure I mean what's \ninteresting now \nis that uh although honestly I would \nalso have to talk about the the \nfine-tuning versus uh rag like let's see \nI think that's super fascinating \num but but on the topic of what you just \nbrought up you know it's kind of \ninteresting you see this pattern in \npodcasting where a guest would go on a \ndifferent podcast and sometimes you get \ndiff totally different things \num but sometimes they kind of say the \nsame thing on five different podcasts oh \nyeah and they kind of have to because \nunless you subscribe to that podcast you \nwon't hear this episode even though it's \nabout the same it's roughly the same \ncontent so I think \nit would be interesting you know if we \nkind of take for granted that it doesn't \nmatter necessarily where you said \nsomething \num because the right content gets to the \nright person the right time then \num \nI think these things will naturally \nevolve to be more distinct every time so \nlike he's like okay we already talked \nabout this people who care about this \nthey already saw this now let's talk \nabout something else \num and obviously there's value to kind \nof repeating the same conversation \nsometimes but but that can be up to the \nperson they don't kind of have to do \nthis to get their message out to some \nextent hmm \nyeah it makes me think about like um I \nguess just the future of social media \ngenerally like if I you know just like \nlooked up Bob inlight and I just saw \nlike um you know a summary of what he's \nbeen talking about for the last week on \nyou know Twitter Hacker News uh LinkedIn \nmaybe even like I think because there's \nalso this interesting kind of \ninterception between like your internal \ncompany meetings like and maybe I'm \ngoing on topic but like it's kind of \nthis whole all this like podcasting \nstuff I think it's just extremely \nrelated to just recording your team \nmeetings within your company like I'd \nimagine like you know that that there \ncould be there's so much value to be \nextracted by just you know getting more \nof capturing the information shared in \nthese kind of meetings but \nyeah it's all it's all really \ninteresting I I maybe wanted to pitch an \nidea to you which was like um you know \none of these machine learning \nconferences iclr they developed \nsomething called open review where they \nyou know they open source the um the \nreviews for papers and I was and I'm and \nyou know Twitter has like Community \nnotes Now sort of x x it's called X now \nI'm not it's gonna take me a while to \nremember to say that but well I still \ncall Facebook I can't do the meta thing \nyeah I actually have started calling him \nI think because like the the Llama 2 \nmodels the image like because now it's \nso I'm seeing the like you know all \nthese exciting things and it's like meta \nand it could be more for me too it's \nstarting to do fine \nyeah yeah but um so I was curious about \nwhat like an open review Community notes \nfor podcasts might look like where like \nmaybe the platform shows the \ntranscription and like you like because \nsometimes I say things on the podcast \nand then later I'm like ah I actually \ndon't really think of it that way you \nknow you your podcast basically it's \nlike oh this is not quite right yeah \nyeah and like people could kind of \nyeah \nyeah that's that's a really interesting \nthing \num \nI I think this like in an ideal world \nlike you should have always you know \nwhile you're listening like \nbe able to open your podcast app and and \nkind of see okay where can I go from \nhere so kind of like a combination of me \nnote but also okay this he heard \nsomething this sounds really interesting \nwhat are you know Clips related to this \ntopic that you're right now listening to \nuh from other podcasts potentially \num and uh and obviously with llms you \ncan combine this with like a different \nperspective like and and this starts to \napply more and more if you get to like \npolitical topics right there's like \nsomebody's talking says something with \nthis that moment oh that's an \ninteresting argument like did somebody \nrespond to this argument on some other \npodcast I think that that could be very \nvery interesting \num \nand uh and obviously when you start \ntalking about Clips then \num \nyou don't even have to interrupt \nanything you can kind of let people if \nyou display a clip you can display the \ncounter clip at the same time you can \ndisplay related tweets about it I mean \nyeah I think there's a lot of potential \nthere and I'm a big fan of like open \nreview I think that you know on Academia \nthe the existing peer review system adds \na complete unreasonable amount of \nfriction and you can see what happens \nyou know with tweets the community like \nor seats I don't know what we call them \nnow \nlike it actually works right like this \nlike people like you get really useful \ncontext \num \nand \nif we can do this like we should do this \neverywhere rather than add friction you \nknow you could either block the Tweet \nuntil they got community reviewed or you \ncan let everything go and and \nput allow context to surface up \nuh with intelligence uh kind of as \nobjectively as possible \num \nyeah I love that that like um yeah like \num they they used to call it like \nmisinformation detection and then \nthere's all like there could be bias but \nI think yeah that kind of like here's \none perspective here's the counter \nperspective it reminds me like well it \nkind of coming back to thinking about \npodcasting it reminds me of there's this \nlanguage modeling decoding algorithm \ncalled tree of thoughts where tree of \nthoughts is like you sample all sorts of \ncontinue like you know because language \nmodels are stochastic models and so they \ncould sample many different generations \nand so say I sampled 10 and then you \nknow I keep expanding the tree with 10 \nfrom 10 you know and so like I there's \nso many directions the podcast could go \nin and I think the other thing that's \nreally brilliant about that idea with \npodcasting is like you alternate the \nlanguage models that continue the tree \nand they impersonate Conor impersonate a \ntie by like either being and this is \ncomes back to our fine-tuning versus rag \nThing by either being the fine-tuned \nConor llm or being the rag Conor LM \nthat's hooked up to like because I I \nthink I prefer the rag thing as being \nthe directions huge for the future \nbecause I think it's going to be easier \nI don't know it's it's a really tricky \nthing because it's getting really cheap \nto fine-tune language models with uh \nsparse fine tuning and all that stuff so \nbut maybe it's right now it's definitely \neasier to just curate the Corpus of \ninformation and things I've said to them \nimpersonate me with a rag to the chat to \nthe like gpt4 API yeah but yeah I do \nthink that like how many different ways \ncould we have continued our conversation \nwe're having right now right like I feel \nlike maybe like in a meta breaking like \nthe fourth wall everything everywhere \nall at once like what what's the other \nversions of the conversation \nyeah and then having all those \ntranscriptions and then um it will okay \nso this is kind of another idea I had \nwritten down that I wanted to pitch to \nyou is I had you Shang Wu on the podcast \nwho's building something called chat \nArena and so chat arena is like where \nyou simulate conversations between \npeople and Personnel other people yeah \nso the Stanford or something else \nI think uh UCL uh \nyeah sorry but and this would be another \nbenefit of the community notes is you \ncan always correct because it's sorry \nI'm getting off topic but this idea of \nlike you simulate all these \nconversations and then you look for \nIntel like look for new ideas in the \nsimulated conversation like \nthat one that's that's interesting \num \nit's kind of like like I've gotten a ton \nof new ideas from talking to you now and \nbut it's like um well yeah it's like \ncould an llm \nbecause you know these like how you \nexplain to me like a lot of these topics \njust comes from your real experience I \ndon't know if an llm impersonating you \nwould be able to react to come up with \nthese new things but yeah there's like a \nlot of debate I think about like whether \nsynthetic data can discover new \nknowledge broadly kind of yeah and no \nit's it's super interesting I think it's \nit's uh I mean it all kind of connects \nalso the fine tuning versus you know uh \nrag because \nI think we're all still learning it \nsounds like a cliche but it's true that \nwe're all still learning there's this \nnew tool in the world and we don't \nreally know what it's good at and what \nit's not and you can really see that \nclearly if you look at any blog posts \nabout like gpt3 when it came out you \nknow like two years ago or maybe a \nlittle longer at this point like they're \nextremely naive from our perspective \nright now like people are like saying oh \nwhat does it mean that it can like \nautocomplete the story like that but not \nlike that like and then like what we are \ndiscovering over time is no there's \nthese these types of things it's good at \nthese types of things it's bad these are \nyou know uh you know rlhf like here's a \ntechnique a pretty simple technique \nwhere like one percent extra compute all \nof a sudden this thing is \nmuch more capable at uh this thing and I \nthink we will find you know what I I \nthink there's almost certainly room for \nfine tuning I I find it really hard to \nbelieve that like in two years like oh \nforget fine-tuning just do rag maybe I \ndon't know but I find it a little bit \nhard to believe uh with existing \ntechnology because it's just so much it \nit's so effective at um \nespecially kind of \nselecting pre-existing capabilities from \nthe base model because otherwise all you \nhave to to talk all you have to \navailable to explain to the language \nmodel what you want is inside of the \ncontext window and that only gives you \nso much opportunity and practically it's \noften just way way too verbose you know \npeople do like few shot learning if \nyou're trying to get a Json out of a \nlanguage model like you might give it \nfive examples ten examples like you're \nnot going to give it 5 000 examples in \nyour context Windows \num and uh but with fine tuning you can \ndo that and I mean that's what when \nopenai added function calling like \nthat's you know people try to solve that \nproblem with chains \nfor a month and you can get to some \nplaces like you know there's uh there's \na bunch of pro there's like the \nguardrails project there's uh Json \nformer but but the fine-tuning really \nreally picks this up and on the other \nhand if you just care about plain facts \nthen yeah probably it seems like that's \na place where \num rag is uh more helpful than you know \nfine-tuning new facts into the model \num \nbut uh sorry I'm forget I'm forgetting \nlike how we we there was like the point \nhere another good point to have that \nI'll test the yeah no I I got a ton it \nout of that I mean I think um yeah I \ncan't reveal who said this yet but um a \nrecent review podcast it separated it \nbetween if you want to teach the \nlanguage model a new skill versus then \nfine tune versus knowledge then rag is \none perspective but think about it like \nlearn a skill versus learn knowledge \nlike a lawyer you know has the knowledge \nof like here's the law says and then \nthey have the skill of how to craft the \nargument from the laws kind of a and I \ncan kind of relate to that thing and I \nguess kind of you know you mentioned the \nlong context thing I mean and then \nthere's kind of the idea of also like \nwell instead of investing the energy and \nfine-tuning the language model maybe you \nfine-tune the embedding model or just \ntweak your search systems with like the \nrank you know ranking tuning and maybe \nthere's just more to that giving it the \nperfect context but kind of like \nsomething and I hope I'm not about to \nget get us off topic too much but like \nthis kind of thing of you mentioned like \ngbt3 to gbt4 I mean what a phase shift \nright like gbt3 you had to like you know \nfew shop prompt it to do a task badly I \nmean like I almost set your opinion it \nwould like come on you know and so now \nit's like talking to you fluently and \nit's it's like blown the world's mind \nlike everyone you talk to if you talk to \nthem about Chachi BT they're like they \nget it and it's crazy where whereas I \ndon't think people really reacted to \nthat with gbt3 but I think kind of like \nto me it's like this idea of like \nexperience grounds language or on \nmeaning and uh understanding it kind \ncoming towards nlu paper from Emily \nBender I I forget the title but like the \nthe language models that are doing RL HF \nto like do customer support like we had \nthis thing Kappa AI in our slack and it \nwas you know it answers your questions \nabout weaviate \nand I imagine having a conversation with \nthat language model can maybe be \ninteresting because you're like what are \nyou learning like you answered 5 000 \nquestions like what are people asking \nwhat are you learning and maybe there's \nsomething to that I'm not sure that's \nwhere we got it before right like the \ncreativity part so I'm actually in my \npersonal life forget like product \ndevelopment like I've I've had many \ninteractions with a language model that \nfelt like it evoked creativity right \nlike it like you bounce ideas you know I \nmean even rubber ducking can be helpful \nbut this was not a rubber duck right \nlike it actually gave its own creativity \nnow I I think probably it got I don't \nthink it made things up it only got at \nthem from pre-existing things that are \nrelated but you know I am not aware of \nthese things that are out there \num and B like one of the big advantages \nof language models is you know they \ndon't get psychologically stuck I guess \nthey can right you can get this Loop but \nevery time every run is a fresh run \num and \num \nso that can help you get out of some you \nknow you might see a problem in this \nkind of very you know laser focused \nblindfolds uh way uh and that language \nunlock you kind of open up a new \ndirection that you maybe you would have \ngone to eventually but but it will take \nyou a while so yeah I think there's \ndefinitely opportunity to actually make \nthese things interesting uh and \nespecially the more intelligent small \nintelligent models \num \nyeah like you said gpd4 versus gpt3 is a \nbig big jump \num \nyeah absolutely I think that um you know \nsome people it's only interpolating but \nit's like okay but it's interpolating \nbetween a super high dimensional space \nand it's like the inner you know the \ninterpolations in this space are still \ngoing to be really interesting yeah like \nmeasure I love that topic of like how do \nyou measure generalization broadly but \nyeah also I think this has been an \nincredible coverage of topics and so I \nyeah kind of wrapping this up I I think \nwe did explore so many topics but is \nthere maybe anything you want to \nconclude with kind of on like how you \nsee the future of podcasting I mean I \nknow we talked about a lot of potential \nthings but like kind of maybe one thing \nthat maybe you even had like maybe \nbefore we started talking we already \nkind of like what what you're convinced \nof \nyeah so I mean I think you know \npodcasting and generally audio video \num you know like I said like talking \nwe're building this audio video database \nis the first internal kind of design \npartner of this \num product and \nI think what's obvious is if you look \nthree years down the line \none way or another \num audio video are gonna become as \nsearchable as text \num where you can search and search and \nanalyzable right so you can now do \nanalysis at the level of semantics \num you know like podcast is one \napplication of this call centers I think \nthat we brought this up at another Point \nthat's another big application and right \nnow you have to build all this custom \ncode to answer pretty general questions \nlike you know where are there calls \nwhere the customer got angry and in the \nend actually got resolved well \num and in legal analysis people like do \nLegion assets over audio and video uh so \nso this this is I think what's really \ninteresting is the trend of taking these \nunstructured you know speech and uh and \nvideo later too when you look at actual \npixel on the screen and \num \nmake them as analyzable as we're used to \nwith text uh so so I think that's going \nto be very interesting and because \nthere's so much knowledge and high \nquality knowledge locked away in these \nformats I think that will that will have \na a big impact uh \nyeah I \nI really turn into the exploding head \nemoji because the um like this post game \nanalysis I you know I had a conversation \nwith my brother-in-law this weekend who \ndoes uh stand up comedy and and we're \ntalking about like stand-up comedy \nversus like giving an academic lecture \nand kind of like the way the crowd \nreacts to it and it's and it just makes \nme think like you know after you do uh \ncomedy or a comedy podcast maybe you'd \nbe like you know how did I do how many \nlaughs did I get and that kind of visual \ninformation but I think it's also very \ninteresting for like the academic thing \nbecause it's not as obvious like you \nknow if you laugh like you laugh and it \ncan probably easily detect that whereas \nlike if you pitch like an idea in the \nother in the guest like likes it or you \nlike you know like you're like oh you \nknow like it's like more of a subtle \nthing and I think that kind of like \npost-game analysis of like you know how \ndid I do in the podcast like was I \ninteresting and I think there probably \nis a lot of like um audio visual like \ninformation that you would not get out \nof just the text transcript right but \nright now I'm I'm personally very by \ntowards the text I you know that's where \nwe're starting out like right now we're \nnot really looking at visual stuff at \nall that that most of the information is \nI think in the text \nyeah but I mean certainly that audio \nvideo there's certainly there's going to \nbe breakthroughs in deep learning in \nthat I yeah \nyeah \nyeah really cool supposed to be in \nthat's high thank you so much for \njoining the weba podcast this is such an \nengaging conversation for me I learned \nso much to change opened my eyes about \nthis
