crewin here JP is here dudas here Mayanshere but also we have a special guestRica's viskovskis or Richards viskovskishe taught me how to pronounce his namejust before they call and I alreadymessed it up yay for meum so this is super excitingum yet another episode and uh we we knowwe're so happy to always do thosesessionsum so just a bit of you knowwhat they call it home keeping no likeuh basically housekeeping godum yesum so thank you all for watching andlistening it's really great to have youhere like as and then definitely give usa shout in the comments uh let us knowwhere you watch from and we'lldefinitely give you a shout backum definitely uh please subscribe to ourYouTube channel so that you always knowwhen we beat air pops up uh and and anyother content that we are creating uhplease um ask questions as we go and Ialways say the same thing it's such agreat thing that these sessions are livemaybe you see uh this like with fiveseconds Delay from uh from when I saythese words but it is kind of like let'ssay five seconds liveish uh where youcan ask questions and react toeverything that we say that we do if youlike the demo that you'll be seeinglater like you know share it with us orask more questions and I will share itwith everybody else and it's reallygreat so thanks for watching and uh yeahbe part of this shopand so the agenda is as follows so firstwe will start with Richards as ourspecial guest uh who created a prettycool project for a hackathon that heparticipated at it's called vki it's anautonomous testing agent but I don'twant to spoil more about it uh than thanthat actually I don't know much moreit's going to be as exciting for you asit is for me so Richard is going to showit for us next up we will be talkingabout the python client update uh we'realmost there with like the rewrite ofthe Python client so and we have likesome really cool things to show for youand if this is a new thing for you likeyou're gonna love it it's absolutelyamazingum then you know the Autumn is comingOktoberfest is almost here and we willbe participating there will be some waysfor uh all of you to kind of contributeand uh and help us out so why notum Duda is going to be at to nowhere soI will share a little bit of messagearound that it's going to be great andthen at the endwould like to try this time is tryanswer maybe some Community questions sowe we do hear some questions from thecommunity popping up on our Forum or onthe community slack so we'll hand pick acouple of questions and maybe go overthem have a quick discussion and that'skind of the idea so yeah just a reminderplease subscribe and definitely thankyou for watching thank you for beinghereum and then let's get cracking so ourspecial guest uh Richards youparticipated in a hackathon tell usabout it like what was the hackathonwhat did you door introduce yourself as well in yourown words okay so my name is RichardsI'm from Latvia currently I am a secondyear a bachelor student at the LatinUniversity and the hacked on like was itwas like a super exciting opportunitynot only to dive deeper in AI which waslike one of the first experiences one ofmy first experience with a but also todevelop and work on the idea which Ireally love myself which is a softwaredevelopment and the software testingand this facton which was organized bylab Lab AI was like especially very goodfor this as it's a not only offered youa choice to develop many interestingSolutions but also give you a wide rangeof tools you could try you could learnabout and also play with so that'sthat's the cool partnice niceum yeah so I know you prepared like alittle presentation to go over to kindof like explainyeah sure sure let's do that let's let'sdive in right inso yeah uh the the idea which Ipersonally worked on this hacked on wasthe autonomous software testing agentand my main motivation to do this dothat because because of my previousexperience in uh development especiallyback end and full stack developmentso while working with the companyespecially during internship periods asI'm a student I had a really good chanceto not only work on interesting tasksbut also to observe how where theyevaluated The Who reviewed my code andall these aspectsand I came to to the conclusion that thethe topic of software development andmore specifically software testing isquite importantand the quality of the software is alsoreally important so there are a coupleof things which I personally uh likereviewed and observed is thatunderstanding of code and therequirements are like maybe one of themost crucial parts and also the abilityto explain to your development teamcolleagues uh how the code should workwhat's the problem why there are somethings that don't work is also extremelyimportantso that's why I decided to participatein this hacked on and the command with asolution which would hopefully simplifythis process of testing softwareensuring quality and communicating itback to the development teamand here I would like to present you myoverall diagram of how I worked withthis solution andyou can see that currently as this isonly a hacked on project and I onlystarted a really recently I focused onthe main part which is uh understandingthe code understanding the requirementsas I mentioned which is essentially thethe cruel part hereuh what's what's the interesting pointhere is that uh we should be able to uhto test the application from differentperspectives not only how it worksinternally like unit test or internalfunctions but also how it works alltogether combinedand how it would help developers itwould be automated it will be able toinclude in your already existinginfrastructure like Ci or CD pipelineit would also provide you with feedbackand parts which you could potentiallyimprove in your software and one of myfuture ideas which I also came up withduring the hacked on and I discussedwith several others is that it shouldalso be able to not only provide youfeedback but also give improvements inthe code itself and make thoseimprovementsbut today I would like to maybe talkmore in detail about exactly thesesoftware requirements and called storagequestionsso the software requirementspecification as as I see it you justthe explanation of how this specificsoftware should work which we areinterested to testand currently as we know there are manydifferent types of software requirementspecifications different formats andit's not quite easy to consolidateeverything and put it in one placeso what I'm currently working on istrying to like come up with a one ormore like of standard standardized wayhow uh this tool this software testingagent would understand and parse therequirements into something more usableand the current approach I use for forthings like PDFs or text files isconverting them to more readable formatslike more than splitting into smallerchunks and also saving to alleviate sothat we can build our knowledge basewith the with it and also use it laterand the cool thing with leviate is thatit already provides provided me in thehackathon this infrastructure and thegreat support so that I can do it muchmore easierwith the code base it's uh quite asimilar situation we we are alsointerested in understanding the codefully which means not only understandingthe concept the the context of somespecific code parts for some specificfiles but understanding detailing whatare the code structures we see in eachfile like classes functions methods andEtcso the typical typical like workflow howI would do this is get these files fromthe either version control system or geton those from locally then split theminto smaller parts as I said which arelike basic structures of the languageand again uh store them in the aviatevector storage for the easier and moreefficient retrievaland when we have already prepared both asoftware requirements and the code baseknowledge knowledge basis we can workforward and combine them and combiningit is also one quite challenging aspectthere are several approaches we couldtake here but personally during thehacked on I I'll find maybe the twoapproachesand the one which is the most simple andthe most basic is going through thesoftware requirements knowledge base andsearching the relevance and theappropriate places in the code wherethese requirements are implemented thiswill not only ensure that all the codewhich is in requirement is implementedin real lifeis also a good option and a good goodway to ensure that our application ourtesting agent has all the necessarycontext about the application we arewilling to testand when we have this information we canpass it to llm for the further test casegenerationthe other approach which I would say ismore suitable in cases when we are maybeinterested in testing only one part ofcode or ensuring morethat specific feature of the code isimplemented is when we start withlooking at the code files which we arechanging or we are working on and thenfinding the appropriate requirementswhich Define how these concrete exactplaces should workand as well when we and when we get thiswe also pass it forward to generate thetest casesso I will I will show in a short periodof time my current demo proof of conceptand but but the main challenges Ipersonally encountered during thishackathon and also currently when Icontinue to develop this idea was uhfirst of allthe requirements in code management howdo we ensure that we split those thingsinto like really meaningful Parts likewe split the requirement document intofeatures where each feature belongs aswell as code how do we split it so thatit's a more readable of course inhackathon due to the lack of time maybeI use not demonstration or techniqueslike exploring everything into just oneone file but the for future work it'simportant to consider these questions aswell I experimented and try differentembedding models and prompts and I'malso currently doing that to find likethe optimal or maybe a more efficientway how can we uh like vectorize andalso embed the information we have fromthe code and the software requirementsand of course there are more technicalchallenges like creating the wholeinfrastructure for example from a tofrom A to B how we go from the code andthe social requirements to be fullyworking tests and feedback providing tothe team these are more technicalquestions and these are those which Iwould like to work afterwards I find outthe answers to these main questionsand now I would like to show a short uhproof of concept which I came up withso here it isthis proof of concept is essentiallytakes a small portion of code this thisis a very simple code it's just likecalculating a basic mathematicalcalculationswith some some variables and some rulesof what should happen if the providedinput is not in correct formathey Richard just one one sec could youzoom in a little bit like if you do likeyeah yeah that's perfect yeah this isgreat great soabout this is about the code I also uh Ialso shared this link with uh later sothat you can you can access and viewthis proof of conceptbut then I provided the softwarerequirement specification exactly forthis code which specifies how eachfunction for example calculate discountprice or calculate square area shouldwork what are the inputs what are theoutput values of this uh this is likeyou can imagine it's like a defaulttemplate for a software requirementspecification of course in the fullversion we would see something like acombined version it would be bothtextual formats maybe maybe somerequirements are in the projectmanagement software like jira these jiratickets how it should work but for nowit's just like this and this is theoutput the test cases in text formatwhich we can see here for thespecifically for the calculate discountsand as you can see for such a simplefunction there are quite many detailedthese test cases which it generates andthere are also the generated unit testsin this example I use unit test becauseit's more easier to demonstratebut we can see that yeah it generatedfor each the test case described in textit also provides us with the actual unittestsin a more production like environment Iwould like to include not only unittests as I said but also more advancedtests like integration e to E Hfunctional tests so that we so that wecan look at this solution of thisprogram for different perspectives togenerate like like a really detailed andhigh quality feedback to our developmentteamso that's shortly uh it's from me ifyou're interested in the exactly thehackathon solution which I worked on youcan follow this link it's it's alsoprovided in the proof of conceptrepository so thank you for having meand yeah let's connectperfect this was such a great overviewand and by the way we've shared alreadyone of the links in in the descriptionof the video so if any of you want tosee it it's uh it's thereum so this is definitely greatum I I really love it like so it itreally like explained to me quite a lotlike when you went like hey this is myuh description of the the requirementsand then you just generated code fromthat uh that is so cool and did you didyou run that code yourself to verifythat the uni test passedbut yeah actually when I yeah I run thiscode I also run thethe previous character code of coursethere are like maybe some little changesif we look at this uh like here forexample this this my module would notexist because I did not specificallyDefine it but conceptually all these uhlike all these test cases they're takenfrom the like quietest likeapply this function quite as the testingmodule so technically yeah they shouldthey should be able to runso yeah but as it is a demo I'm stillworking on making it more quality likeand also evaluating the result itprovides to me so that there are like noweird we are dealt with with test caseswhich don't runnice question as wellum so would the like umfrom from a more from a user perspectiveI would say right so uh whatum uh your your agent tell thedevelopment team if they missed out onsome specifications for example or umwhat would be like the business goal forI would say like you know if you havelike like uh a development organizationand somebody is writing the specs andanother team is writing the code wouldthe developers get uh insights and wherethey missed out on certain specs or isit mainly about like writing test casesof the code they provide is actuallyworking properlyuh so the idea here was that umI will show maybe quickly back to mydiagram is that uh I I would like toprovide also this feedback uh sendingnot only about the test cases becauseit's possible that the teams alreadywrote the test casesbut it's also possible that it's justlike maybe some untested code and theidea what would be that it like providesmaybe in form of a jira or GitHub issuemaybe a form of an email it providesback to developers uh not only how thetests performed or when they runsuccessfully did the sound which testsfail which success but also perform likea feedback improvements like you youshould improve the code here this is thethe like maybe ultimate ideait would workthat's really cool because like I guessthen you can test the um I guess notevaluate tests comparisons specs as tosay oh maybe the tests can cover theseit's like scenarios you know in pi testright when you're parameters and thingslike that and provide feedback that waytoo which like automated tools thesedays can't really do right as far as Iunderstandyeah that's that's why also partiallywhy I tried wanted to tackle this umthis problem because there are manygreat tools like GitHub compilot whichhelp us during the development time theyreally give us good good suggestions onhow to write our code but the importantpart is also ensuring that like thesecond layer of uh evaluation that afterwe maybe deploy or publish thisapplication to some production or likestaging server it evaluates again thateverything is indeed working yeahnice nice Hey so uh some words ofencouragement from somebody watching usso Bob says like very nice example usecase right so uh hey yeah for anyonewatching um definitely give Richard's uhGita repo a star you know like let'slet's show so appreciationum maybe we can get to double digitstoday or uh by the end of the week thatwould be awesomeum but yeah I totally agree it's such acool use case and immediately in my headalso goes in like how meta can we getcould you add the specification for yourcode so that you could generate testsfor this project have you tried thatoh that that's actually that's a reallycool experiment uh I have not tried thatyet because I was a bit lazy and Ididn't write specification but uh butthe idea is that yeah it should itshould definitely happen and as a yeahand as I already said as I'm student Ialso have many school projects where Ineed to write some software and uhdevelop some simple maybe simpleapplications and I would definitely Ithink it will be beneficial to test mycode which I wrote there using this toolyou know you could go the other way justwrite some code and then get a languagemodel to write the specs using your codepretend you had the specs all along andyou're correctyeah yeah that's also that's also thecase yeah it's possibleI was kind of thinking that it couldalso be an interesting test uh becausesome of those models can understand whatthe code is supposed to do it's kind oflike saying like if I share this calledvanilla I'm like what would it say aboutthe code and then sometimes you go likeoh you you got exactly what I was tryingto do here or sometimes you go like oh Ididn't think about that that maybethere's something about it so yeahthere's so many interesting aspects ofit yeah that's a that's really great andthat's what why I'm interested inactively collecting feed but feedbackabout this because yeah it's many greatideas appear in this wayyeah absolutely I've got one morequestion um you mentioned sorry youmentioned chunking in in terms of yourpipeline of things you had to do you getquestions about chunking quite a bit interms of ingesting longerum bits of it like longer Quantum ofinformation right and deciding how towhat chunk to use in terms of how tochunk information what it's like by sizeor by some sort of um syntactic markersor what have youum how did you choose to do it and didyou experiment with different differentchunking methods and sizesyeah the the first thing like the thesimplest which I did during thehackathon was just placing like a largedocument maybe tracking by Pages justone page is one chunk it's it's verybasic but this was the fastestthen uh what I did with umwith the software requirementspecification I was chunking either byparagraphs like each paragraph is aseparate chunk or trying to make maybethis by by markdowns somehow splittingthem by heading subheadings and each ofthese like subheading is a separatechart but then there is a question uhlike how to ensure that all thefunctionality which is uh expected inthis specific requirement is covered inthis one chunk and also maybe we shouldmake online features several chunks Imean if it's a very large issue andabout codes I mainly chunked by all byfunctions for example likehere it's if it's a short function Ibelieve it's it's okay to like chunk byfunction it's really like really longfunction which takes many many linesthen I would consider a chunking by likesmaller code structures uh maybe Loopsconditionals and so on that's uh that'sthat's the approach I believethat that's yeah it's aum sounds like you've tried differentthings there and that's really cool andI think you know getting experience likethat from someone like yourself who'sbuilt a real project and experiment orthought about different chunking methodsand experimented it's like really usefulfor listeners as well because it'sI've kind of found that there's notreally a one-size-fits-all answer forpeopleyou know so it's really tricky to belike uh just just do this just chunk itat 150 words it's all good umbut yeah that's really awesome are yousaying there's no one truck one trunkfeature no one chunk of it so that'sexactly right yeahthat's the chill engine yeah reallyreally interested in also seeing howcalled this exactly how to change thatand the currently trying to collect ateam of students who are also interestedin working with it and we are discussingmany different approaches this can besold so that's that's cool awesome andif you you know uh would love to hearback from you whether it's through thecommunity forums or slack or whateveryou know if you kind of experimentdifferent sizes and what works I'm surewe can work on some you know follow-upswhether it's a blog or something becauseI'm definitely working on some chunkingrelated material for for our audience aswellokay that's that's great we'll be reallyhappy to do that yeah yeah absolutelyall right this was great this uh westarted on the strong like let's keep uplike the the tempo and the Rhythm uhthis was an amazing demo and uh I'mreally looking forward to see what youbuild in the future uh or maybe what'suh what's your dissertation project youknow that you can deal with it thatwould be awesomeum so next up it's um it's a topic thatI feel very passionate about uhpersonally and for anyone that joinedjust now because some of you uh joined abit later and everything uh this is alive show uh drop us a you know acomment questions anything feel free toask we will uh share the stuff that youasked us or maybe some of the uh thecomments that you share and then wecould always respond to it so this isgreatum so on the topic that I feel verypassionate about to come back to is thepython client update and and then to behonest like when I joined wivate like Iimmediately fell in love like I thoughtwith it was great it allowed you to doamazing things in a really like a shortperiod of time but there was alwayssomething that was like nagging at theback of my head that whenever Iinteracted with like our clients likeespecially the python client I alwaysfelt like it we could do better we couldmake it easier we could make it morestraightforwardum so that was like that that littlenagging kind of grew into somethingbigger and then there's also like therewas some Community feedback but alsosome internal feedback that we had andeventually we kind of got to the point Iwas like Hey listen uh let's stop uhthat nagging feeling you know ofSebastian and many other people aroundand then let's do something about itright so we went onto our project andthere's uh the four people involved liketo the biggest extent so JP is one ofthem uh it's me then we have Dirk and uhand Tommy from the engineering team uhso we kind of went in like hey let'srewrite some of the Python client partsand we came up like this uh differentconcepts and so the long story short islike um can we go from like let's sayfive lines of code to run a query tomaybe a one-liner or two liner orsomething or making a lot more readablebut also uh could we make it more like aID friendly so like you get like a lotof code completion and helpum and and that that was kind of theidea so I know jpu prepared something toshare because uh JP has been like such ahuge Champion as part of this project uhand we even have a blog post uh thatmostly JP wrote let's let's face itum that basically talks about this newclient so we are at the stage where wewould like to get your feedback Etc solet's talk about it yeah for sure howabout we put my uh the blog post upum yeah let's do it go from there sothis is only one of this is like part ofthe pressesum of yesterdayum so you can find it by going to ourwebsite and clicking on the blog link onthe top nav barum really encourage you check it outobviously there's a lot of other reallyamazing content there as well but justread this one firstum but so this one's uh like like Iwrote this like over the last couple ofdays and I had a lot of fun writing itright and it was for a couple reasons II like writing that's one but alsobecause I the project was so much funand it was really gratifying in terms ofhow usable the client became or so howmuch more usable the client became alongthe course of this project so when I wasputting together there's a Code examplesand whatever I was like oh this reallyis noticeably I think a huge Improvementto to the sort of developer experiencerightso I won't go throughum a lot of detail here but there's acouple of things I do want to talk aboutone is what the key changes are right soin terms of what we were going for likeone is that we're calling thisinternally the collections API which isbecause we focused on changing this kindof unit of how you interact with yourdata so that before you're kind ofdealing with the client so that you'redealing with your whole webia instancein uh through the client object but nowwhat we've done is centered a lot of theinteractions and the API around eachcollection and by collection I means thething that we quite often call a classwhich is a set of waveyard objects butthat leads to sort of confusion innomenclature and whatever so callingthat a collection but yeah so um I'llshow a demo to see exactly what thismeans and the other is object typingright so a lot of us use IDs that's notyou know the just that the plain texteditor and this really provides with alot of likeum sort of quality of life improvementswith type hands and auto completions andso on which you'll seeum throughout the kind of code demo thatI'll put that it will go through theother thing that you want visibly see inthe live coding is the performanceimprovements right and that's changingfrom um our kind of graphql based backend to grpc and I won't go through a lotof the details here but basically theum that really improves how the datagets transmitted from the client to theserverand there's a couple of reasons whythat's faster but basically it's lessdata and it's less processing requiredright so so that's basically the reasonfor it so we definitely encourage you toto check it out by reading the blog postand also going to this page which islinked here called experimental clientso let's have a look there and that'sbasically a user guide so we don't havea fully featured like we haven't justoverhauled our documentation to get ridof all the documentation or relationsthe new old client but if you want totry the new client this is where you canget started here's a bit of an overviewbut there's more of a set ofinstructions and examples so you can getstarted soum having said that the let's get into alittle bit of live coding and see howwell or poorly I doum so how about and I can't share twoscreens at once I'm gonna stop sharingthis and I have to represent my whichopens up the question how many screensdo you have JP sorry I misspoke I Imeant I I can't seem to share multipleapps in one go because then Sebastiancould have very seamlessly switched overbut um I can do that so what I've doneis that we have a bunch of code from thequick start right so hopefully if you'veused weave yet before you might havecome across our quick start guide andthis these are like code Snippets fromthe quick start what I thought we coulddo today in the short demo is to gothrough the quick start and I can justrecreate bits of it with the new codeand show you what that looks like rightso this is just kind of like thehousekeeping of like how do you connectthe clientthere's one big change because we'reimporting all of these uh making use ofall these custom python classes you cancollect import them as a whole underthis waviate classes sub module and usethem if you don't if that doesn't make awhole lot of sense you'll see that inlike two secondsumso let's get started so we've got a codechunk like this where you would create aclass or a collection right and thechallenge with this is that it's untypeddictionary or Json depending on whatnomenclature you speak right so you haveto remember that this thing is calledthe vectorizer you have a config keycalled module config and so on and soforthwith the new client it looks like this Igo client collectiondot createnow if I use this function I start toget these hints on the overlay so I cansay what is my collection called wellit's questionand let's configure the vectorize allright so now I can go back okay so if Istart typing vectorizer I get thispop-up doesn't come up on the screenshare okay we'll just take my word forit I'm getting on autocompletion pop-upcalled for that I can select from calledvectorizer config so that's not typedthat or used autocompleteand then I can start typing withautocomplete which I assure you existseven though it's not showing up on thescreen shareum I'll talk to Tim Apple about that andconfig dot config Factoryvectorizer Dotopen AInow to write this slide even though thisline is longer I think I've typed aboutseven characters and then Auto completedthe rest of it right and I can do thesame thing with module with thegenerative config so I can just go GEpath generated config wvc concreteFactory so it's unpiping like Co tabautocompletegenerative dot open AIso you can see here that the room formaking mistakes is drastically smallerbecause I'm getting all these type hintsand so onand then yeah what I also like about itby the way like JPum so if you have like the text to backopen AI right nowum like you go like hey I just wantdefault settings with open AI but if youwanted to choose like a different modelor something uh you could just likeprovide that inside right like so insidethe braces yeah you could just do modelequals and then like you super quicklike say like hey these are theavailable options right this is what Ican doum yeah and and that makes it like likesuper readable and like more intuitivefor all of you to discover what is evenpossible definitelyum I was gonna say you get this tool tipif you move your mouse over to open AIfunction and of course that's notshowing up on the screen sharing eitherbut you do get all the parameter namesand the doc strings and all of that overhere as well which is really reallyhandyum I'll make a video for it later forsureum cool and in terms of importing dataall the same uh it's it's like similarlymore convenientI can say data insert manyum and just put the dates on objectshere right so I would goumcreate thisobject 40 inso this is all I would need to do to dothe same job that the above block ofcode is doingqueries is also really simple now if Ican I can say questions dotum questions dot query dot what am Idoing we need a textagainthis command is basically the same thingas what's happening up here and that'sfor a couple of reasonsthese parameters that we used to have tospecify to say hey I want these columnsor properties back from the server nowthese get returned by default you canstill specify them if you want tominimize how much data you fetch butthis makes it like really easy to getstarted to play with and so onum and the nice thing this is alsoreally cool is doing things likegenerative search right soum doing what's called retrievalaugmented generation or generativesearch what just just converting thatearlier queryinto a rad query means you have to justall you have to do is sub out swap outthe sub module to generate from queryand then I'll break these up intoseparate linesand sayum what am I doing group taskequals let's copy that line hereso again this is now the same thing aswhat's aboveand also even just dealing with theresponse object it was a fairly deeplynested Json object in the past so you'dhave to use syntax like this to dig intoData get question blah blah blah but nowall you would have to do is we'll haveto actually capture the response into anobject so response oh my goodnessresponseum you you get no no uh typing help withvariable names huh not yetum I should turn copilot back on uh sothis is all you'd have to do so thiswell I guess I have to have a printfunctionumit's the exact same thingas thisreallythat is pretty cool yeah so this isreally nice I I personally really likeit and I've been having a lot of funjust you do have to rewrite all the docsyou know right uhyou knowum Dave's not here right I'll get Davetodaybut it will be one of those like you doa massive rewrite and it was like why isthere like thousand lines of code lessyou know that's so coolum yeah but no I think the other thingWorth showing as well JP is like becauseyou showed how to get generated from uhresponse but also like the query valuesitself it's also way way shorter becauseI think what is it like response dot uhobjects now objects this is how you willget the actual set of objects and thenwhat comes back is a list so um youwon't get pipins at this pointum maybe yeahum so I can say object is that and thenI can do things like object dot oh youdo get pythons fantasticum soproperties right is how you would getaccess to properties like that objectdot metadata Dot euidlet's try a question we get a lot likelet's count uh all the objectsum so that's too much coding on the Flyyou picked your one query type that'snot yet implemented because that's anaggregate query which is like likeaggregate sets of queries which is notimplemented so you'll have to still doit the old wayum but the the what's currently now theget queries are implemented so that'swhat these areum so response dot queryoh my goodness um questions dot queryso this would be the graphqlgetwe've got questions dot generative whichare like graphql get with generativerightand then we have questions dot um datawhich is your crud operations I guessit's really cud because it's createupdate delete and we have questions dotGroup byum and I personally really like thegroup by improvements because thegraphql query for this is literally like12 to 15 lines longum and this query when I tried it I senta message to Tommy and Dirk yesterdayand said this is amazing because it'snow like four lines of code to performthese these um functions so uh I Ipersonally love itum obviously but I we want to get yourfeedback and we've been doing internaluser testing that's been really reallyvaluable so Duda you you've done it andthen we've got really good feedback fromyou at an early stage Sebastian you'vedone itum you know like and kind of pretendingyou don't know all the things you knowas you've been being part of the thedevelopment cycle but we really want tohear from you the audience right so weput up a post in the community Forumsorry it's community like talking aboutit I'll post more demos but pleaseplease pleaseum if you can read through the the blogand try it out using that experimentalclient page and there's a feedback formthat we've linked to so we would love tohear from youum if you have like you know we've alsogot a I think uh form or I guess boxtext box in there for your email orcontact which is entirely optional butif you don't mind being contacted aboutyour feedback maybe we'll contact youjust to get some more information ormaybe even have a one-on-one sessionum but but yeah we're really excitedabout it like I'm super excited about itand uh yeah we'll love to see where thisgoes and and I don't know exactly whenit's going to be rolled out because Ihad that question even earlier todayfrom shakri who was like really excitedum but I think sooner rather than lateryeah so there's one one example youdidn't show that I was super passionateabout it because I just threw it earlydaysum as an idea and I know you know whatI'm what I'm talking about but that'sthe iterator so yeah that was like oneof the big challenges and I literallywas helping somebody towards the end oflast week via email of how to likeliterally the task of like how do I gothrough all of my data and that that atthe moment the example that we have it'slike20 30 lines of code where you can usethe fetch API we made it like with thisclientsilly like silly easyum so yeah I'm sure that just reallyquickly so right now you have to usewhat we internally call the theum cursor API okayand this is kind of what the umum the vector with limit nope that's notrightumI see so you need with after cursor okayit basically looks like that sorry thecode example is is broken down intofunctions which is Sebastian this isexactly what you're talking aboutearlier today it's so hard to wrap yourhead around the original approach rightbut this is kind of what it looks likeyou have to get the cursor you have toget the batch size and and whateverum with the new client it just kind oflooks like this so you hang on let mejust make sure I get the syntax rightyeah it's just a sobut basically I think it overloads thepython iterator or maybe just like isset up in the class too so you can usethe built-in python iterator to do thisso if you want to just get the allobjects outwe can just go questions and I wouldjust use a list comprehension queue forQ in blah right this is all we wouldhave to do to get literally all theobjects out this way and you can choosewithin this syntax what parameters youwant to get out so you can specify herelike the return metadata is you knowmetadata queryum whoops uidequals true Vector equals true so if youonly get just the ID and the vector outfor all the objects this is all youwould have to doum so yeah this is this is fantastic toobecause againum Marion and I Marion was asking aboutit earlier today too that she gets thisquestion for people who perhaps don'thave access to the backup featurebecause it's not set up whatever andwant to manually export objectsum or if you want to migrate yourdatabase or just even want to I had aquestion about someone who wanted tovalidate their data against some othersecondary database or somethingum this is going to be such a burden forjust simplifying your code baseyeah I think this is an approach of likelet's say if you have like a small dataset because of course if you have 10million objects you don't want to putall of them in one array but what youcan also do with the iterator you couldjust straight up use the for Loop rightand then like exactly like this and thenbelow you could just um have your coderight so in hereyou go run one by one and then theiterator will fetch a bunch of objectseach time and and then give it give themto you yeah it's just like yeah thisused to be several lines of code nowit's like a two liner like hey yeah thatis so nice and clean and it's veryreadable too which I like and you getall theum tools like I guess I got the tooltips you guys didn't with the screenshare problems but um also if you'reusing Jupiter you can get the you canrun a function with question markquestion mark to get the doc stringswhich you couldn't do before with thebuilder patternum so yeahso far so far it's been very positiveinternallyum but you know I'm sure it's notperfect right wellprobablyyeah some cases some people are like ohthis doesn't quite work for me and wereally want to know if that's the caserightum of course we think it's great butthat's why your feedback would be reallyreally usefulyeah yeah I think it's awesome and likeif you just scroll back to the beginninga little bit the one thing that isalways worth remembering where you havethe uh where you create that questionsobject in case like you got lost uh onthat part the line 41 so like the usualstory is like hey I want to get acollection so that question is like thename of the The Collection uh and andthen basically you always work with thatobject so if you had like a separate uhcollection called articles you could dothe same thing right like you just sayarticles equals client.collection.getarticles and then all the operationswouldn't happen on that collection rightso you don't have to every single timedo thatum yeah and there's loads of otherthings like the support around likecreating references and all this likethere's so much we could literally spendtwo hours talking about just that but umyeah I'm definitely worth checking outthe article yeah we can definitely seeyou're amazed that's a good seguesmashing though because is next ThursdayI will spend an hour talking about it onan online Workshop yeah yeahlike I think it's a great reminder foranyoneum that if you go like onto our websiteunder developers workshopsum we always share like the introworkshops and different types ofworkshops so uh JP shared there's aworkshop on the 5th of October so ifyou'd like to participate and kind oflike learn more about this new pythonclient uh whether you want to learn moreby us guiding you through it or byproviding us some feedback andeverything I will definitely dive deeperinto like different parts of it so uhhe's sharing it yeah so that's the pageif you could just quickly show how toget to workshops uh from the yeah ohyeah developers page or wherever I cango on the developers and on the pulldown menu you can click on workshops[Music]after our episodes finished that'lldisappear from the list and the nextWorkshop would be the intro or workshopwith Duda um that's tomorrowand uh yeah Zen's got one next week andwe've got the collections Workshop nextThursdayperfectall right so um yeah thanks for thispresentation JP this was awesomeum really like super excited abouthearing feedback from the communityum it's gonna be great so let's do aquick one around the Oktoberfest I knowuh JP you are involved with this andyeah you know very little bitum uh so the dev growth team's beendoing amazing work organizingOktoberfest I'm more just kind of likeyou know helping out here and there umin like a tiny tiny wayum Leona's done amazing work with thisso if I can share my screen again againSebastian like the exact same window sowhat she's done um so far which isreally cool is to refresh our exampleuse cases and demos page you can findthat by going into NABA which is by theway now collapsible going to moreresources example use cases and demosyeah and what you can and what you'llsee is that we have all these use casesum with demos that are marked withpumpkin signs so with during the courseof October October yeah um October we'llhave these projects that uh we want tobasically refresh right so these arekind of like all the way the demos andwhat have you which could do as a littlebit of love a little bit of touch up andrefreshingum or improvementsum so we've marked these with pumpkinsand they can be like any number ofthings they can be like sure codecontributions but also things like heyif you're a tech writer maybe you wantto contribute to the readme or thecontributor guide maybe you want to makesome material around it with video demosmaybe you're a JavaScript person andthere's a python demo so you're going toPort it to python sorry to JavaScript orgo or whateverso um we want to we want to make producethese like small tasks that arebite-sized and You Know Rich Richard youmentioned this right you're you knowyou're a student you got stuff on youcan't feel like building a demo for likethree weeks full time but there's likethese small parts of a project that youcan contribute to engage with us and andlearn and make new friends and whateversoum there'll be more detail coming up Ibelieve Leon is working on a blog postso keep uh keep your eyes peeled forthat and uh yeah you knowjust have fun right you know what wouldbe really cool if um someone took one ofthose projects and used the new clientlike rewrite with the new client thatwould be awesome that would be awesomeum you know yeah I'd be I I'd be I'dhighly encourage that evenyeah let's do it let's do it oh I Ishould have asked uh Richard uh likewhat do you think of the new clientbecause when you work on the hackathonum you use our old client of courseright but I guess the new clients yeahyeah I guess that well it's it's likelooks like like much much better likevery cool for the hackathon use casebecause uh I remember when uh it's gotlike 24 hours left until the finalsubmission and uh I'm trying to writesomething there like maybe some verybasic demo but the new clients likewould have helped me a lotso with these uh these much shortersyntaxwe have all the Octoberfest like veryvery cool idea I believeso yeah that's very something veryinteresting to try outyou know we would love to have you backyou know in some capacity right come andcome and check out the projects and seewhat you might want to work on inbetween in between doing assignments anddoing all the university thingsum but yeah I I think it's gonna be funI think hopefully we get lots ofdifferent people from diversebackgrounds and and whatever elsebecauseum there's different tasks kind ofhopefully for for lots of differentpeople right soyeah that's coolexcellent excellent all rightum cool so in this caseum we like well we do that is going tobe at the Latino wear right uh Hey did Ilike what's this conference about likeuh what is it uh why should

in Portuguese themajority of them are in Portuguese andSpanish uh but if you want to to tryyour your selfie Portuguese please uhfeel free to do that and also I'm goingto be talking about uh are not relatedto Evie but also related to the deviatewhich is a Google summer of code so I'mgoing to have three very nice activitiesthere for the three days uh it will itwill happen at 18 through 20 of Octoberuh so it's it's it's a three daysconference and it's very intense uh andthat's not only about dolphins firstlike open source software but also openHardware you have like people doingdesigning and it's a huge event with alot of different activities that have uha place for everybody so join us and ifyou want to to go there we are going tobe there so feel free to comeuhlink so it's latinoware.org soother talks recorded so you mightmention this yes yes we have there thereis on YouTube we have a uh a Channelwith all the talks recorded so you cantry to follow that you know activatemaybe the the transcription and andfollow thatawesomethe other day I saw on LinkedIn this uhamazingum Trend AI translator where it justtranslates your lip uh your lip uh uh umsynchronization and everything andtranslates what you say into a differentlanguage pretty cool you should use itnice nice yeah we could test it outbecause we all speak perfectlyPortuguese here rightyears of listening to Bossa Novaprepared me for this conference oh goodgoodwell maybe the vocabulary doesn't coverit but that's fineum and speaking of meeting us indifferent places now is time maybeMarion uh you're involved in likekicking off like some of our Meetupactivities and uh exactly so you'resuper passionate about itum and soyou share my screen thenso yeah it's like woohoo so cycling wetalk a lot about Community contributionsand alsoum about the workshops so we have beengetting more and more questions when wecan meet in real life and we picked upthat feedback so oh that's interestingwe do have a couple of things going onthey are not all online yet but that islike a sneak peek for like for thepricing client now it's for thecommunity event so what's coming up andwe do have a meet-up in New York comingup this Zayn then talking uh aboutmulti-modality so watch out andSebastian is going to be there too sowatch out our um our website on thebottom of it you do find our meetups wedo have a workshop coming up in New Yorkas well the next day where you canactually get your hands onin November we are going to be in Berlintogether with our friends from Ivanagain like in Londonum who has who knows uh we have beenAnonymous as well and in December we aregoing to be in Berlin with the ml OpsCommunityum and there's much much more in thecooking that it's just nothing it's sofinal that I would like to share it butkeep your eyes on our website we aregoing to announce it on LinkedIn andespecially in our meetup groupsso yeahI'm looking forward to see youyay super exciting yeah because wealready talked about like we don't havedates yet for those places but yeahwe're talking about doing something inLondon probably Amsterdam exactly in SanFrancisco there's actually somethinghappening in San Francisco about nowanywayum like right now it will be everywhereyeah right now right so uh shout out toPhilippe and Erica and Connor and theteam that are there and Adamum that's why they're not in this inmovie

about that in SanFrancisco there's one in October 2nd andMeetup is Haystackdefinitely worth joining and it's on ourmeetup groups so again the v8.io andthen on the bottom you find our meetupgroupsyeah yeah and they'll be with two oneand uh tuana is such a great uh personas well so uh that'll be great yeah I'mso jealous of anyone that's going to bethere for thatit's gonna be awesomeum perfect and then the final uh segmentis again going back to do that uh goingthrough some Community questions so wehave some questions that are like poppop up here and there and we said likehey maybe we could just have like alittle conversation about them and thenhelp you all out to kind of understandin case you also wondered about thesethingsum so do that the first question thatyou nominated is what is the impact ofthe tokenization setting for a datapropertyyes that's right and and also uh a niceuh a nice remembering that if you if youhave any questions on your journey tolearn about weaviate uh you can join usin the Forum you can go to the Wi-Fiwebsite and you can have their forumsand also we we also have the hours likeuh we are we are trying to move out thequestions to The Forum because that isflexible uh so whatever the the whereverthe content that we create on the Forumit stays there for other users to tosearch and to help themselves uh but wehave seen some questions and we will betrying to to bring those questions hereand try to to shade some light on it sothe idea is that sometimes people willsay hey I have I have a a query here I'msearching for for something and I'mgetting some mixed results and that maybe because of the tokenization strategyfor your data property uh so let meshare and then we have uhbecause the the the property you can setdifferent tokenization properties foryour for your property right uh soshould I share my screen here just alittle bit yeah that'll be great uhokay and while dude is doing that um Iguess that probably relates to like nota vector search right so tokenizationthere's like two types of differentindexes that get built with data inreview one is the um Vector index forsimilarity searching and then the otheris an inverted index which a lot ofpeople are probably familiar with fromkind of more traditional databases andthis I think relates toum the inverted Index right data yes yesthat's right uh even though you have youmight confuse the tokenization with thevectorization and all that but this ismostly for the the hybrid or vm25 searchuh so what happens is that by the foolwe have the the word as the tokenizationright which means that it's going to toindex each word by itself but you havedifferent uh settings here and then theidea is that you need to change thataccording to what you expect as a resultright so bear in mind that we you canchange there's uh one more knob that youcan you can have a new Eva to change toto to to your specification uh so beforethinking that it's not working properlyuh when you're searching for for for uhyou're doing some queries you need to beaware of this tokenization parametersthat it can influentiate in your in yourqueriesokaynice nice yeahso should we jump in a second questionyeah we do have some questions that alot of people are always asking how wecan because there's so much thing thatyou can do with free V8 right you cannot only with tax but audio and videoand all that together and then you canthrow some generative contents on top ofthat and and then it's it gets reallycrazy it gets a lot of possibilities anda lot of people a lot of time uh peopleare asking what we can do where we cansee some examples on what we can do withreview it right and we do have a lot ofexamples uh some of them are on the sameplace but some of them are elsewhere uhthe first one that I want to show isthat we have some really nice recipesthat we are still growing there is stillsome other examples that we can show soif you go to a repository and search forrecipes we are going to have their uhgenerative search Hybrid searchIntegrations multi-tenancy and all allof them right now it doesn't have onefor for typescript but we are working onthat so soon we are going to have uh thesame examples with the same data andeverything together for Python and alsofor typescript another set of goodexamples that we we have that youprobably saw there on the on the that'salso available for the the hacktoberfestis that we have alleviate examples andthese we have very nice very interestingexamples that we have done uh and ourcommunity have contributed so forexample one that I really like is thisattendance system example which you canhave uh I think there's some screenshotshere so basically you can have ascreenshot and then uh you can you canhave the people that is previouslycreated on this screenshot and you canhave like an attendance like becauseconsider that you can take a picture ofyour class and then map reason thatpicture and like uhthat's a very nice example we have heresome uh some players in another examplethat I'm really excited is the auditionclassification which is basically usingthe the audio in order to identify theclass with some some other uhother previouslyexamples so all of them are registeredhere is very easy if you have anytroubles uh playing around with thoseagain come to our forums we are there tohelp you another one that we have isanother is a different organizationaltogether we have Eva tutorials uh andinside this organization we have a lotof repositories with different uh partsof our of of codes and examples on howyou can those users are some like forfor example intro shop or how to ingestPDFs unstructured so there's a differentset of of repositories there and thelast two there were I wouldn't like Iwould like to show is a health searchand this is a whole project that we havethat was created from from for our fromour growth team uh so that's a veryinteresting that it's using generativesearch to create reviews based on thereviews of the users so it's a very uhreal world example on how to use viviatewhich is very very fine very very fun toto use and very nice nicely done and thelast one is verba which we aredeveloping which is very interestingthat you can throw a lot of contents inthere and then you can search for thosethose uh those contents and see wherethey came from where the answer iscoming from and this is a very uh youknow a lot of a lot of people that comesto Eva they want to create this kind ofof solutions at first like it's a veryinteresting solution so here's a verynice way on how to do that and all ofthose examples are there and again ifyou have any troubles uh playing aroundwith that come to us we are here to helpand we're we're going to be there on theforums on this lag on the email on themeetups on every place trying to to helpyou on your journey and that's it forfor those examplesexcellent thank you for uh for for thisand um I like I think this could be anew tradition that we could always endup with like maybe a couple of questionsfrom the community and then provide abit of an insight and we'll definitelybe looking for any questions from likemaybe on our slack Etc like if you likeus to answer you know like aconversational style this is definitelyuh the wayso this uh gets us to the end of this weget error it's been it's been a pleasureit's been great uh thank you all foryour time thank you for watching andthank you for listening whether youwatch with us live the show or whetheryou're watching it like you know fewhours or days after we've recorded itdefinitely thank you thank you very muchfor your time we really appreciate it ifif not for you we wouldn't be doing itright so uh if you enjoyed this video orany part especially if you lovedRichard's demo give us a like uh thatwill definitely help us out help us outplease subscribe to the channel I'll sayit again because then you will not missout the next movie there we do themevery monthso um that's it for me so thank you verymuch uh thank you for your time and havea great day bye bye byesilly says bye bye Miss silly[Music]wait I thought I pressed and", "type": "Video", "name":
