{"text": "The hackathon project: https://github.com/liskovich/ricai_concept_proof Python Client update: ... \nforeign \n[Music] \nair we are so excited to have you here \num so I'm Sebastian I have a great crew \nin here JP is here dudas here Mayans \nhere but also we have a special guest \nRica's viskovskis or Richards viskovskis \nhe taught me how to pronounce his name \njust before they call and I already \nmessed it up yay for me \num so this is super exciting \num yet another episode and uh we we know \nwe're so happy to always do those \nsessions \num so just a bit of you know \nwhat they call it home keeping no like \nuh basically housekeeping god \num yes \num so thank you all for watching and \nlistening it's really great to have you \nhere like as and then definitely give us \na shout in the comments uh let us know \nwhere you watch from and we'll \ndefinitely give you a shout back \num definitely uh please subscribe to our \nYouTube channel so that you always know \nwhen we beat air pops up uh and and any \nother content that we are creating uh \nplease um ask questions as we go and I \nalways say the same thing it's such a \ngreat thing that these sessions are live \nmaybe you see uh this like with five \nseconds Delay from uh from when I say \nthese words but it is kind of like let's \nsay five seconds liveish uh where you \ncan ask questions and react to \neverything that we say that we do if you \nlike the demo that you'll be seeing \nlater like you know share it with us or \nask more questions and I will share it \nwith everybody else and it's really \ngreat so thanks for watching and uh yeah \nbe part of this shop \nand so the agenda is as follows so first \nwe will start with Richards as our \nspecial guest uh who created a pretty \ncool project for a hackathon that he \nparticipated at it's called vki it's an \nautonomous testing agent but I don't \nwant to spoil more about it uh than than \nthat actually I don't know much more \nit's going to be as exciting for you as \nit is for me so Richard is going to show \nit for us next up we will be talking \nabout the python client update uh we're \nalmost there with like the rewrite of \nthe Python client so and we have like \nsome really cool things to show for you \nand if this is a new thing for you like \nyou're gonna love it it's absolutely \namazing \num then you know the Autumn is coming \nOktoberfest is almost here and we will \nbe participating there will be some ways \nfor uh all of you to kind of contribute \nand uh and help us out so why not \num Duda is going to be at to nowhere so \nI will share a little bit of message \naround that it's going to be great and \nthen at the end \nwould like to try this time is try \nanswer maybe some Community questions so \nwe we do hear some questions from the \ncommunity popping up on our Forum or on \nthe community slack so we'll hand pick a \ncouple of questions and maybe go over \nthem have a quick discussion and that's \nkind of the idea so yeah just a reminder \nplease subscribe and definitely thank \nyou for watching thank you for being \nhere \num and then let's get cracking so our \nspecial guest uh Richards you \nparticipated in a hackathon tell us \nabout it like what was the hackathon \nwhat did you do \nor introduce yourself as well in your \nown words okay so my name is Richards \nI'm from Latvia currently I am a second \nyear a bachelor student at the Latin \nUniversity and the hacked on like was it \nwas like a super exciting opportunity \nnot only to dive deeper in AI which was \nlike one of the first experiences one of \nmy first experience with a but also to \ndevelop and work on the idea which I \nreally love myself which is a software \ndevelopment and the software testing \nand this facton which was organized by \nlab Lab AI was like especially very good \nfor this as it's a not only offered you \na choice to develop many interesting \nSolutions but also give you a wide range \nof tools you could try you could learn \nabout and also play with so that's \nthat's the cool part \nnice nice \num yeah so I know you prepared like a \nlittle presentation to go over to kind \nof like explain \nyeah sure sure let's do that let's let's \ndive in right in \nso yeah uh the the idea which I \npersonally worked on this hacked on was \nthe autonomous software testing agent \nand my main motivation to do this do \nthat because because of my previous \nexperience in uh development especially \nback end and full stack development \nso while working with the company \nespecially during internship periods as \nI'm a student I had a really good chance \nto not only work on interesting tasks \nbut also to observe how where they \nevaluated The Who reviewed my code and \nall these aspects \nand I came to to the conclusion that the \nthe topic of software development and \nmore specifically software testing is \nquite important \nand the quality of the software is also \nreally important so there are a couple \nof things which I personally uh like \nreviewed and observed is that \nunderstanding of code and the \nrequirements are like maybe one of the \nmost crucial parts and also the ability \nto explain to your development team \ncolleagues uh how the code should work \nwhat's the problem why there are some \nthings that don't work is also extremely \nimportant \nso that's why I decided to participate \nin this hacked on and the command with a \nsolution which would hopefully simplify \nthis process of testing software \nensuring quality and communicating it \nback to the development team \nand here I would like to present you my \noverall diagram of how I worked with \nthis solution and \nyou can see that currently as this is \nonly a hacked on project and I only \nstarted a really recently I focused on \nthe main part which is uh understanding \nthe code understanding the requirements \nas I mentioned which is essentially the \nthe cruel part here \nuh what's what's the interesting point \nhere is that uh we should be able to uh \nto test the application from different \nperspectives not only how it works \ninternally like unit test or internal \nfunctions but also how it works all \ntogether combined \nand how it would help developers it \nwould be automated it will be able to \ninclude in your already existing \ninfrastructure like Ci or CD pipeline \nit would also provide you with feedback \nand parts which you could potentially \nimprove in your software and one of my \nfuture ideas which I also came up with \nduring the hacked on and I discussed \nwith several others is that it should \nalso be able to not only provide you \nfeedback but also give improvements in \nthe code itself and make those \nimprovements \nbut today I would like to maybe talk \nmore in detail about exactly these \nsoftware requirements and called storage \nquestions \nso the software requirement \nspecification as as I see it you just \nthe explanation of how this specific \nsoftware should work which we are \ninterested to test \nand currently as we know there are many \ndifferent types of software requirement \nspecifications different formats and \nit's not quite easy to consolidate \neverything and put it in one place \nso what I'm currently working on is \ntrying to like come up with a one or \nmore like of standard standardized way \nhow uh this tool this software testing \nagent would understand and parse the \nrequirements into something more usable \nand the current approach I use for for \nthings like PDFs or text files is \nconverting them to more readable formats \nlike more than splitting into smaller \nchunks and also saving to alleviate so \nthat we can build our knowledge base \nwith the with it and also use it later \nand the cool thing with leviate is that \nit already provides provided me in the \nhackathon this infrastructure and the \ngreat support so that I can do it much \nmore easier \nwith the code base it's uh quite a \nsimilar situation we we are also \ninterested in understanding the code \nfully which means not only understanding \nthe concept the the context of some \nspecific code parts for some specific \nfiles but understanding detailing what \nare the code structures we see in each \nfile like classes functions methods and \nEtc \nso the typical typical like workflow how \nI would do this is get these files from \nthe either version control system or get \non those from locally then split them \ninto smaller parts as I said which are \nlike basic structures of the language \nand again uh store them in the aviate \nvector storage for the easier and more \nefficient retrieval \nand when we have already prepared both a \nsoftware requirements and the code base \nknowledge knowledge basis we can work \nforward and combine them and combining \nit is also one quite challenging aspect \nthere are several approaches we could \ntake here but personally during the \nhacked on I I'll find maybe the two \napproaches \nand the one which is the most simple and \nthe most basic is going through the \nsoftware requirements knowledge base and \nsearching the relevance and the \nappropriate places in the code where \nthese requirements are implemented this \nwill not only ensure that all the code \nwhich is in requirement is implemented \nin real life \nis also a good option and a good good \nway to ensure that our application our \ntesting agent has all the necessary \ncontext about the application we are \nwilling to test \nand when we have this information we can \npass it to llm for the further test case \ngeneration \nthe other approach which I would say is \nmore suitable in cases when we are maybe \ninterested in testing only one part of \ncode or ensuring more \nthat specific feature of the code is \nimplemented is when we start with \nlooking at the code files which we are \nchanging or we are working on and then \nfinding the appropriate requirements \nwhich Define how these concrete exact \nplaces should work \nand as well when we and when we get this \nwe also pass it forward to generate the \ntest cases \nso I will I will show in a short period \nof time my current demo proof of concept \nand but but the main challenges I \npersonally encountered during this \nhackathon and also currently when I \ncontinue to develop this idea was uh \nfirst of all \nthe requirements in code management how \ndo we ensure that we split those things \ninto like really meaningful Parts like \nwe split the requirement document into \nfeatures where each feature belongs as \nwell as code how do we split it so that \nit's a more readable of course in \nhackathon due to the lack of time maybe \nI use not demonstration or techniques \nlike exploring everything into just one \none file but the for future work it's \nimportant to consider these questions as \nwell I experimented and try different \nembedding models and prompts and I'm \nalso currently doing that to find like \nthe optimal or maybe a more efficient \nway how can we uh like vectorize and \nalso embed the information we have from \nthe code and the software requirements \nand of course there are more technical \nchallenges like creating the whole \ninfrastructure for example from a to \nfrom A to B how we go from the code and \nthe social requirements to be fully \nworking tests and feedback providing to \nthe team these are more technical \nquestions and these are those which I \nwould like to work afterwards I find out \nthe answers to these main questions \nand now I would like to show a short uh \nproof of concept which I came up with \nso here it is \nthis proof of concept is essentially \ntakes a small portion of code this this \nis a very simple code it's just like \ncalculating a basic mathematical \ncalculations \nwith some some variables and some rules \nof what should happen if the provided \ninput is not in correct format \nhey Richard just one one sec could you \nzoom in a little bit like if you do like \nyeah yeah that's perfect yeah this is \ngreat great so \nabout this is about the code I also uh I \nalso shared this link with uh later so \nthat you can you can access and view \nthis proof of concept \nbut then I provided the software \nrequirement specification exactly for \nthis code which specifies how each \nfunction for example calculate discount \nprice or calculate square area should \nwork what are the inputs what are the \noutput values of this uh this is like \nyou can imagine it's like a default \ntemplate for a software requirement \nspecification of course in the full \nversion we would see something like a \ncombined version it would be both \ntextual formats maybe maybe some \nrequirements are in the project \nmanagement software like jira these jira \ntickets how it should work but for now \nit's just like this and this is the \noutput the test cases in text format \nwhich we can see here for the \nspecifically for the calculate discounts \nand as you can see for such a simple \nfunction there are quite many detailed \nthese test cases which it generates and \nthere are also the generated unit tests \nin this example I use unit test because \nit's more easier to demonstrate \nbut we can see that yeah it generated \nfor each the test case described in text \nit also provides us with the actual unit \ntests \nin a more production like environment I \nwould like to include not only unit \ntests as I said but also more advanced \ntests like integration e to E H \nfunctional tests so that we so that we \ncan look at this solution of this \nprogram for different perspectives to \ngenerate like like a really detailed and \nhigh quality feedback to our development \nteam \nso that's shortly uh it's from me if \nyou're interested in the exactly the \nhackathon solution which I worked on you \ncan follow this link it's it's also \nprovided in the proof of concept \nrepository so thank you for having me \nand yeah let's connect \nperfect this was such a great overview \nand and by the way we've shared already \none of the links in in the description \nof the video so if any of you want to \nsee it it's uh it's there \num so this is definitely great \num I I really love it like so it it \nreally like explained to me quite a lot \nlike when you went like hey this is my \nuh description of the the requirements \nand then you just generated code from \nthat uh that is so cool and did you did \nyou run that code yourself to verify \nthat the uni test passed \nbut yeah actually when I yeah I run this \ncode I also run the \nthe previous character code of course \nthere are like maybe some little changes \nif we look at this uh like here for \nexample this this my module would not \nexist because I did not specifically \nDefine it but conceptually all these uh \nlike all these test cases they're taken \nfrom the like quietest like \napply this function quite as the testing \nmodule so technically yeah they should \nthey should be able to run \nso yeah but as it is a demo I'm still \nworking on making it more quality like \nand also evaluating the result it \nprovides to me so that there are like no \nweird we are dealt with with test cases \nwhich don't run \nnice question as well \num so would the like um \nfrom from a more from a user perspective \nI would say right so uh what \num uh your your agent tell the \ndevelopment team if they missed out on \nsome specifications for example or um \nwhat would be like the business goal for \nI would say like you know if you have \nlike like uh a development organization \nand somebody is writing the specs and \nanother team is writing the code would \nthe developers get uh insights and where \nthey missed out on certain specs or is \nit mainly about like writing test cases \nof the code they provide is actually \nworking properly \nuh so the idea here was that um \nI will show maybe quickly back to my \ndiagram is that uh I I would like to \nprovide also this feedback uh sending \nnot only about the test cases because \nit's possible that the teams already \nwrote the test cases \nbut it's also possible that it's just \nlike maybe some untested code and the \nidea what would be that it like provides \nmaybe in form of a jira or GitHub issue \nmaybe a form of an email it provides \nback to developers uh not only how the \ntests performed or when they run \nsuccessfully did the sound which tests \nfail which success but also perform like \na feedback improvements like you you \nshould improve the code here this is the \nthe like maybe ultimate idea \nit would work \nthat's really cool because like I guess \nthen you can test the um I guess not \nevaluate tests comparisons specs as to \nsay oh maybe the tests can cover these \nit's like scenarios you know in pi test \nright when you're parameters and things \nlike that and provide feedback that way \ntoo which like automated tools these \ndays can't really do right as far as I \nunderstand \nyeah that's that's why also partially \nwhy I tried wanted to tackle this um \nthis problem because there are many \ngreat tools like GitHub compilot which \nhelp us during the development time they \nreally give us good good suggestions on \nhow to write our code but the important \npart is also ensuring that like the \nsecond layer of uh evaluation that after \nwe maybe deploy or publish this \napplication to some production or like \nstaging server it evaluates again that \neverything is indeed working yeah \nnice nice Hey so uh some words of \nencouragement from somebody watching us \nso Bob says like very nice example use \ncase right so uh hey yeah for anyone \nwatching um definitely give Richard's uh \nGita repo a star you know like let's \nlet's show so appreciation \num maybe we can get to double digits \ntoday or uh by the end of the week that \nwould be awesome \num but yeah I totally agree it's such a \ncool use case and immediately in my head \nalso goes in like how meta can we get \ncould you add the specification for your \ncode so that you could generate tests \nfor this project have you tried that \noh that that's actually that's a really \ncool experiment uh I have not tried that \nyet because I was a bit lazy and I \ndidn't write specification but uh but \nthe idea is that yeah it should it \nshould definitely happen and as a yeah \nand as I already said as I'm student I \nalso have many school projects where I \nneed to write some software and uh \ndevelop some simple maybe simple \napplications and I would definitely I \nthink it will be beneficial to test my \ncode which I wrote there using this tool \nyou know you could go the other way just \nwrite some code and then get a language \nmodel to write the specs using your code \npretend you had the specs all along and \nyou're correct \nyeah yeah that's also that's also the \ncase yeah it's possible \nI was kind of thinking that it could \nalso be an interesting test uh because \nsome of those models can understand what \nthe code is supposed to do it's kind of \nlike saying like if I share this called \nvanilla I'm like what would it say about \nthe code and then sometimes you go like \noh you you got exactly what I was trying \nto do here or sometimes you go like oh I \ndidn't think about that that maybe \nthere's something about it so yeah \nthere's so many interesting aspects of \nit yeah that's a that's really great and \nthat's what why I'm interested in \nactively collecting feed but feedback \nabout this because yeah it's many great \nideas appear in this way \nyeah absolutely I've got one more \nquestion um you mentioned sorry you \nmentioned chunking in in terms of your \npipeline of things you had to do you get \nquestions about chunking quite a bit in \nterms of ingesting longer \num bits of it like longer Quantum of \ninformation right and deciding how to \nwhat chunk to use in terms of how to \nchunk information what it's like by size \nor by some sort of um syntactic markers \nor what have you \num how did you choose to do it and did \nyou experiment with different different \nchunking methods and sizes \nyeah the the first thing like the the \nsimplest which I did during the \nhackathon was just placing like a large \ndocument maybe tracking by Pages just \none page is one chunk it's it's very \nbasic but this was the fastest \nthen uh what I did with um \nwith the software requirement \nspecification I was chunking either by \nparagraphs like each paragraph is a \nseparate chunk or trying to make maybe \nthis by by markdowns somehow splitting \nthem by heading subheadings and each of \nthese like subheading is a separate \nchart but then there is a question uh \nlike how to ensure that all the \nfunctionality which is uh expected in \nthis specific requirement is covered in \nthis one chunk and also maybe we should \nmake online features several chunks I \nmean if it's a very large issue and \nabout codes I mainly chunked by all by \nfunctions for example like \nhere it's if it's a short function I \nbelieve it's it's okay to like chunk by \nfunction it's really like really long \nfunction which takes many many lines \nthen I would consider a chunking by like \nsmaller code structures uh maybe Loops \nconditionals and so on that's uh that's \nthat's the approach I believe \nthat that's yeah it's a \num sounds like you've tried different \nthings there and that's really cool and \nI think you know getting experience like \nthat from someone like yourself who's \nbuilt a real project and experiment or \nthought about different chunking methods \nand experimented it's like really useful \nfor listeners as well because it's \nI've kind of found that there's not \nreally a one-size-fits-all answer for \npeople \nyou know so it's really tricky to be \nlike uh just just do this just chunk it \nat 150 words it's all good um \nbut yeah that's really awesome are you \nsaying there's no one truck one trunk \nfeature no one chunk of it so that's \nexactly right yeah \nthat's the chill engine yeah really \nreally interested in also seeing how \ncalled this exactly how to change that \nand the currently trying to collect a \nteam of students who are also interested \nin working with it and we are discussing \nmany different approaches this can be \nsold so that's that's cool awesome and \nif you you know uh would love to hear \nback from you whether it's through the \ncommunity forums or slack or whatever \nyou know if you kind of experiment \ndifferent sizes and what works I'm sure \nwe can work on some you know follow-ups \nwhether it's a blog or something because \nI'm definitely working on some chunking \nrelated material for for our audience as \nwell \nokay that's that's great we'll be really \nhappy to do that yeah yeah absolutely \nall right this was great this uh we \nstarted on the strong like let's keep up \nlike the the tempo and the Rhythm uh \nthis was an amazing demo and uh I'm \nreally looking forward to see what you \nbuild in the future uh or maybe what's \nuh what's your dissertation project you \nknow that you can deal with it that \nwould be awesome \num so next up it's um it's a topic that \nI feel very passionate about uh \npersonally and for anyone that joined \njust now because some of you uh joined a \nbit later and everything uh this is a \nlive show uh drop us a you know a \ncomment questions anything feel free to \nask we will uh share the stuff that you \nasked us or maybe some of the uh the \ncomments that you share and then we \ncould always respond to it so this is \ngreat \num so on the topic that I feel very \npassionate about to come back to is the \npython client update and and then to be \nhonest like when I joined wivate like I \nimmediately fell in love like I thought \nwith it was great it allowed you to do \namazing things in a really like a short \nperiod of time but there was always \nsomething that was like nagging at the \nback of my head that whenever I \ninteracted with like our clients like \nespecially the python client I always \nfelt like it we could do better we could \nmake it easier we could make it more \nstraightforward \num so that was like that that little \nnagging kind of grew into something \nbigger and then there's also like there \nwas some Community feedback but also \nsome internal feedback that we had and \neventually we kind of got to the point I \nwas like Hey listen uh let's stop uh \nthat nagging feeling you know of \nSebastian and many other people around \nand then let's do something about it \nright so we went onto our project and \nthere's uh the four people involved like \nto the biggest extent so JP is one of \nthem uh it's me then we have Dirk and uh \nand Tommy from the engineering team uh \nso we kind of went in like hey let's \nrewrite some of the Python client parts \nand we came up like this uh different \nconcepts and so the long story short is \nlike um can we go from like let's say \nfive lines of code to run a query to \nmaybe a one-liner or two liner or \nsomething or making a lot more readable \nbut also uh could we make it more like a \nID friendly so like you get like a lot \nof code completion and help \num and and that that was kind of the \nidea so I know jpu prepared something to \nshare because uh JP has been like such a \nhuge Champion as part of this project uh \nand we even have a blog post uh that \nmostly JP wrote let's let's face it \num that basically talks about this new \nclient so we are at the stage where we \nwould like to get your feedback Etc so \nlet's talk about it yeah for sure how \nabout we put my uh the blog post up \num yeah let's do it go from there so \nthis is only one of this is like part of \nthe presses \num of yesterday \num so you can find it by going to our \nwebsite and clicking on the blog link on \nthe top nav bar \num really encourage you check it out \nobviously there's a lot of other really \namazing content there as well but just \nread this one first \num but so this one's uh like like I \nwrote this like over the last couple of \ndays and I had a lot of fun writing it \nright and it was for a couple reasons I \nI like writing that's one but also \nbecause I the project was so much fun \nand it was really gratifying in terms of \nhow usable the client became or so how \nmuch more usable the client became along \nthe course of this project so when I was \nputting together there's a Code examples \nand whatever I was like oh this really \nis noticeably I think a huge Improvement \nto to the sort of developer experience \nright \nso I won't go through \num a lot of detail here but there's a \ncouple of things I do want to talk about \none is what the key changes are right so \nin terms of what we were going for like \none is that we're calling this \ninternally the collections API which is \nbecause we focused on changing this kind \nof unit of how you interact with your \ndata so that before you're kind of \ndealing with the client so that you're \ndealing with your whole webia instance \nin uh through the client object but now \nwhat we've done is centered a lot of the \ninteractions and the API around each \ncollection and by collection I means the \nthing that we quite often call a class \nwhich is a set of waveyard objects but \nthat leads to sort of confusion in \nnomenclature and whatever so calling \nthat a collection but yeah so um I'll \nshow a demo to see exactly what this \nmeans and the other is object typing \nright so a lot of us use IDs that's not \nyou know the just that the plain text \neditor and this really provides with a \nlot of like \num sort of quality of life improvements \nwith type hands and auto completions and \nso on which you'll see \num throughout the kind of code demo that \nI'll put that it will go through the \nother thing that you want visibly see in \nthe live coding is the performance \nimprovements right and that's changing \nfrom um our kind of graphql based back \nend to grpc and I won't go through a lot \nof the details here but basically the \num that really improves how the data \ngets transmitted from the client to the \nserver \nand there's a couple of reasons why \nthat's faster but basically it's less \ndata and it's less processing required \nright so so that's basically the reason \nfor it so we definitely encourage you to \nto check it out by reading the blog post \nand also going to this page which is \nlinked here called experimental client \nso let's have a look there and that's \nbasically a user guide so we don't have \na fully featured like we haven't just \noverhauled our documentation to get rid \nof all the documentation or relations \nthe new old client but if you want to \ntry the new client this is where you can \nget started here's a bit of an overview \nbut there's more of a set of \ninstructions and examples so you can get \nstarted so \num having said that the let's get into a \nlittle bit of live coding and see how \nwell or poorly I do \num so how about and I can't share two \nscreens at once I'm gonna stop sharing \nthis and I have to represent my which \nopens up the question how many screens \ndo you have JP sorry I misspoke I I \nmeant I I can't seem to share multiple \napps in one go because then Sebastian \ncould have very seamlessly switched over \nbut um I can do that so what I've done \nis that we have a bunch of code from the \nquick start right so hopefully if you've \nused weave yet before you might have \ncome across our quick start guide and \nthis these are like code Snippets from \nthe quick start what I thought we could \ndo today in the short demo is to go \nthrough the quick start and I can just \nrecreate bits of it with the new code \nand show you what that looks like right \nso this is just kind of like the \nhousekeeping of like how do you connect \nthe client \nthere's one big change because we're \nimporting all of these uh making use of \nall these custom python classes you can \ncollect import them as a whole under \nthis waviate classes sub module and use \nthem if you don't if that doesn't make a \nwhole lot of sense you'll see that in \nlike two seconds \num \nso let's get started so we've got a code \nchunk like this where you would create a \nclass or a collection right and the \nchallenge with this is that it's untyped \ndictionary or Json depending on what \nnomenclature you speak right so you have \nto remember that this thing is called \nthe vectorizer you have a config key \ncalled module config and so on and so \nforth \nwith the new client it looks like this I \ngo client collection \ndot create \nnow if I use this function I start to \nget these hints on the overlay so I can \nsay what is my collection called well \nit's question \nand let's configure the vectorize all \nright so now I can go back okay so if I \nstart typing vectorizer I get this \npop-up doesn't come up on the screen \nshare okay we'll just take my word for \nit I'm getting on autocompletion pop-up \ncalled for that I can select from called \nvectorizer config so that's not typed \nthat or used autocomplete \nand then I can start typing with \nautocomplete which I assure you exists \neven though it's not showing up on the \nscreen share \num I'll talk to Tim Apple about that and \nconfig dot config Factory \nvectorizer Dot \nopen AI \nnow to write this slide even though this \nline is longer I think I've typed about \nseven characters and then Auto completed \nthe rest of it right and I can do the \nsame thing with module with the \ngenerative config so I can just go GE \npath generated config wvc concrete \nFactory so it's unpiping like Co tab \nautocomplete \ngenerative dot open AI \nso you can see here that the room for \nmaking mistakes is drastically smaller \nbecause I'm getting all these type hints \nand so on \nand then yeah what I also like about it \nby the way like JP \num so if you have like the text to back \nopen AI right now \num like you go like hey I just want \ndefault settings with open AI but if you \nwanted to choose like a different model \nor something uh you could just like \nprovide that inside right like so inside \nthe braces yeah you could just do model \nequals and then like you super quick \nlike say like hey these are the \navailable options right this is what I \ncan do \num yeah and and that makes it like like \nsuper readable and like more intuitive \nfor all of you to discover what is even \npossible definitely \num I was gonna say you get this tool tip \nif you move your mouse over to open AI \nfunction and of course that's not \nshowing up on the screen sharing either \nbut you do get all the parameter names \nand the doc strings and all of that over \nhere as well which is really really \nhandy \num I'll make a video for it later for \nsure \num cool and in terms of importing data \nall the same uh it's it's like similarly \nmore convenient \nI can say data insert many \num and just put the dates on objects \nhere right so I would go \num \ncreate this \nobject 40 in \nso this is all I would need to do to do \nthe same job that the above block of \ncode is doing \nqueries is also really simple now if I \ncan I can say questions dot \num questions dot query dot what am I \ndoing we need a text \nagain \nthis command is basically the same thing \nas what's happening up here and that's \nfor a couple of reasons \nthese parameters that we used to have to \nspecify to say hey I want these columns \nor properties back from the server now \nthese get returned by default you can \nstill specify them if you want to \nminimize how much data you fetch but \nthis makes it like really easy to get \nstarted to play with and so on \num and the nice thing this is also \nreally cool is doing things like \ngenerative search right so \num doing what's called retrieval \naugmented generation or generative \nsearch what just just converting that \nearlier query \ninto a rad query means you have to just \nall you have to do is sub out swap out \nthe sub module to generate from query \nand then I'll break these up into \nseparate lines \nand say \num what am I doing group task \nequals let's copy that line here \nso again this is now the same thing as \nwhat's above \nand also even just dealing with the \nresponse object it was a fairly deeply \nnested Json object in the past so you'd \nhave to use syntax like this to dig into \nData get question blah blah blah but now \nall you would have to do is we'll have \nto actually capture the response into an \nobject so response oh my goodness \nresponse \num you you get no no uh typing help with \nvariable names huh not yet \num I should turn copilot back on uh so \nthis is all you'd have to do so this \nwell I guess I have to have a print \nfunction \num \nit's the exact same thing \nas this \nreally \nthat is pretty cool yeah so this is \nreally nice I I personally really like \nit and I've been having a lot of fun \njust you do have to rewrite all the docs \nyou know right uh \nyou know \num Dave's not here right I'll get Dave \ntoday \nbut it will be one of those like you do \na massive rewrite and it was like why is \nthere like thousand lines of code less \nyou know that's so cool \num yeah but no I think the other thing \nWorth showing as well JP is like because \nyou showed how to get generated from uh \nresponse but also like the query values \nitself it's also way way shorter because \nI think what is it like response dot uh \nobjects now objects this is how you will \nget the actual set of objects and then \nwhat comes back is a list so um you \nwon't get pipins at this point \num maybe yeah \num so I can say object is that and then \nI can do things like object dot oh you \ndo get pythons fantastic \num so \nproperties right is how you would get \naccess to properties like that object \ndot metadata Dot euid \nlet's try a question we get a lot like \nlet's count uh all the objects \num so that's too much coding on the Fly \nyou picked your one query type that's \nnot yet implemented because that's an \naggregate query which is like like \naggregate sets of queries which is not \nimplemented so you'll have to still do \nit the old way \num but the the what's currently now the \nget queries are implemented so that's \nwhat these are \num so response dot query \noh my goodness um questions dot query \nso this would be the graphql \nget \nwe've got questions dot generative which \nare like graphql get with generative \nright \nand then we have questions dot um data \nwhich is your crud operations I guess \nit's really cud because it's create \nupdate delete and we have questions dot \nGroup by \num and I personally really like the \ngroup by improvements because the \ngraphql query for this is literally like \n12 to 15 lines long \num and this query when I tried it I sent \na message to Tommy and Dirk yesterday \nand said this is amazing because it's \nnow like four lines of code to perform \nthese these um functions so uh I I \npersonally love it \num obviously but I we want to get your \nfeedback and we've been doing internal \nuser testing that's been really really \nvaluable so Duda you you've done it and \nthen we've got really good feedback from \nyou at an early stage Sebastian you've \ndone it \num you know like and kind of pretending \nyou don't know all the things you know \nas you've been being part of the the \ndevelopment cycle but we really want to \nhear from you the audience right so we \nput up a post in the community Forum \nsorry it's community like talking about \nit I'll post more demos but please \nplease please \num if you can read through the the blog \nand try it out using that experimental \nclient page and there's a feedback form \nthat we've linked to so we would love to \nhear from you \num if you have like you know we've also \ngot a I think uh form or I guess box \ntext box in there for your email or \ncontact which is entirely optional but \nif you don't mind being contacted about \nyour feedback maybe we'll contact you \njust to get some more information or \nmaybe even have a one-on-one session \num but but yeah we're really excited \nabout it like I'm super excited about it \nand uh yeah we'll love to see where this \ngoes and and I don't know exactly when \nit's going to be rolled out because I \nhad that question even earlier today \nfrom shakri who was like really excited \num but I think sooner rather than later \nyeah so there's one one example you \ndidn't show that I was super passionate \nabout it because I just threw it early \ndays \num as an idea and I know you know what \nI'm what I'm talking about but that's \nthe iterator so yeah that was like one \nof the big challenges and I literally \nwas helping somebody towards the end of \nlast week via email of how to like \nliterally the task of like how do I go \nthrough all of my data and that that at \nthe moment the example that we have it's \nlike \n20 30 lines of code where you can use \nthe fetch API we made it like with this \nclient \nsilly like silly easy \num so yeah I'm sure that just really \nquickly so right now you have to use \nwhat we internally call the the \num cursor API okay \nand this is kind of what the um \num the vector with limit nope that's not \nright \num \nI see so you need with after cursor okay \nit basically looks like that sorry the \ncode example is is broken down into \nfunctions which is Sebastian this is \nexactly what you're talking about \nearlier today it's so hard to wrap your \nhead around the original approach right \nbut this is kind of what it looks like \nyou have to get the cursor you have to \nget the batch size and and whatever \num with the new client it just kind of \nlooks like this so you hang on let me \njust make sure I get the syntax right \nyeah it's just a so \nbut basically I think it overloads the \npython iterator or maybe just like is \nset up in the class too so you can use \nthe built-in python iterator to do this \nso if you want to just get the all \nobjects out \nwe can just go questions and I would \njust use a list comprehension queue for \nQ in blah right this is all we would \nhave to do to get literally all the \nobjects out this way and you can choose \nwithin this syntax what parameters you \nwant to get out so you can specify here \nlike the return metadata is you know \nmetadata query \num whoops uid \nequals true Vector equals true so if you \nonly get just the ID and the vector out \nfor all the objects this is all you \nwould have to do \num so yeah this is this is fantastic too \nbecause again \num Marion and I Marion was asking about \nit earlier today too that she gets this \nquestion for people who perhaps don't \nhave access to the backup feature \nbecause it's not set up whatever and \nwant to manually export objects \num or if you want to migrate your \ndatabase or just even want to I had a \nquestion about someone who wanted to \nvalidate their data against some other \nsecondary database or something \num this is going to be such a burden for \njust simplifying your code base \nyeah I think this is an approach of like \nlet's say if you have like a small data \nset because of course if you have 10 \nmillion objects you don't want to put \nall of them in one array but what you \ncan also do with the iterator you could \njust straight up use the for Loop right \nand then like exactly like this and then \nbelow you could just um have your code \nright so in here \nyou go run one by one and then the \niterator will fetch a bunch of objects \neach time and and then give it give them \nto you yeah it's just like yeah this \nused to be several lines of code now \nit's like a two liner like hey yeah that \nis so nice and clean and it's very \nreadable too which I like and you get \nall the \num tools like I guess I got the tool \ntips you guys didn't with the screen \nshare problems but um also if you're \nusing Jupiter you can get the you can \nrun a function with question mark \nquestion mark to get the doc strings \nwhich you couldn't do before with the \nbuilder pattern \num so yeah \nso far so far it's been very positive \ninternally \num but you know I'm sure it's not \nperfect right well \nprobably \nyeah some cases some people are like oh \nthis doesn't quite work for me and we \nreally want to know if that's the case \nright \num of course we think it's great but \nthat's why your feedback would be really \nreally useful \nyeah yeah I think it's awesome and like \nif you just scroll back to the beginning \na little bit the one thing that is \nalways worth remembering where you have \nthe uh where you create that questions \nobject in case like you got lost uh on \nthat part the line 41 so like the usual \nstory is like hey I want to get a \ncollection so that question is like the \nname of the The Collection uh and and \nthen basically you always work with that \nobject so if you had like a separate uh \ncollection called articles you could do \nthe same thing right like you just say \narticles equals client.collection.get \narticles and then all the operations \nwouldn't happen on that collection right \nso you don't have to every single time \ndo that \num yeah and there's loads of other \nthings like the support around like \ncreating references and all this like \nthere's so much we could literally spend \ntwo hours talking about just that but um \nyeah I'm definitely worth checking out \nthe article yeah we can definitely see \nyou're amazed that's a good segue \nsmashing though because is next Thursday \nI will spend an hour talking about it on \nan online Workshop yeah yeah \nlike I think it's a great reminder for \nanyone \num that if you go like onto our website \nunder developers workshops \num we always share like the intro \nworkshops and different types of \nworkshops so uh JP shared there's a \nworkshop on the 5th of October so if \nyou'd like to participate and kind of \nlike learn more about this new python \nclient uh whether you want to learn more \nby us guiding you through it or by \nproviding us some feedback and \neverything I will definitely dive deeper \ninto like different parts of it so uh \nhe's sharing it yeah so that's the page \nif you could just quickly show how to \nget to workshops uh from the yeah oh \nyeah developers page or wherever I can \ngo on the developers and on the pull \ndown menu you can click on workshops \n[Music] \nafter our episodes finished that'll \ndisappear from the list and the next \nWorkshop would be the intro or workshop \nwith Duda um that's tomorrow \nand uh yeah Zen's got one next week and \nwe've got the collections Workshop next \nThursday \nperfect \nall right so um yeah thanks for this \npresentation JP this was awesome \num really like super excited about \nhearing feedback from the community \num it's gonna be great so let's do a \nquick one around the Oktoberfest I know \nuh JP you are involved with this and \nyeah you know very little bit \num uh so the dev growth team's been \ndoing amazing work organizing \nOktoberfest I'm more just kind of like \nyou know helping out here and there um \nin like a tiny tiny way \num Leona's done amazing work with this \nso if I can share my screen again again \nSebastian like the exact same window so \nwhat she's done um so far which is \nreally cool is to refresh our example \nuse cases and demos page you can find \nthat by going into NABA which is by the \nway now collapsible going to more \nresources example use cases and demos \nyeah and what you can and what you'll \nsee is that we have all these use cases \num with demos that are marked with \npumpkin signs so with during the course \nof October October yeah um October we'll \nhave these projects that uh we want to \nbasically refresh right so these are \nkind of like all the way the demos and \nwhat have you which could do as a little \nbit of love a little bit of touch up and \nrefreshing \num or improvements \num so we've marked these with pumpkins \nand they can be like any number of \nthings they can be like sure code \ncontributions but also things like hey \nif you're a tech writer maybe you want \nto contribute to the readme or the \ncontributor guide maybe you want to make \nsome material around it with video demos \nmaybe you're a JavaScript person and \nthere's a python demo so you're going to \nPort it to python sorry to JavaScript or \ngo or whatever \nso um we want to we want to make produce \nthese like small tasks that are \nbite-sized and You Know Rich Richard you \nmentioned this right you're you know \nyou're a student you got stuff on you \ncan't feel like building a demo for like \nthree weeks full time but there's like \nthese small parts of a project that you \ncan contribute to engage with us and and \nlearn and make new friends and whatever \nso \num there'll be more detail coming up I \nbelieve Leon is working on a blog post \nso keep uh keep your eyes peeled for \nthat and uh yeah you know \njust have fun right you know what would \nbe really cool if um someone took one of \nthose projects and used the new client \nlike rewrite with the new client that \nwould be awesome that would be awesome \num you know yeah I'd be I I'd be I'd \nhighly encourage that even \nyeah let's do it let's do it oh I I \nshould have asked uh Richard uh like \nwhat do you think of the new client \nbecause when you work on the hackathon \num you use our old client of course \nright but I guess the new clients yeah \nyeah I guess that well it's it's like \nlooks like like much much better like \nvery cool for the hackathon use case \nbecause uh I remember when uh it's got \nlike 24 hours left until the final \nsubmission and uh I'm trying to write \nsomething there like maybe some very \nbasic demo but the new clients like \nwould have helped me a lot \nso with these uh these much shorter \nsyntax \nwe have all the Octoberfest like very \nvery cool idea I believe \nso yeah that's very something very \ninteresting to try out \nyou know we would love to have you back \nyou know in some capacity right come and \ncome and check out the projects and see \nwhat you might want to work on in \nbetween in between doing assignments and \ndoing all the university things \num but yeah I I think it's gonna be fun \nI think hopefully we get lots of \ndifferent people from diverse \nbackgrounds and and whatever else \nbecause \num there's different tasks kind of \nhopefully for for lots of different \npeople right so \nyeah that's cool \nexcellent excellent all right \num cool so in this case \num we like well we do that is going to \nbe at the Latino wear right uh Hey did I \nlike what's this conference about like \nuh what is it uh why should anyone join \nand Etc \nalso lets you know where is the event \nthat happens here in South America it \nhappens in Fort De guasu in Paradise \nState fatiguez who is in the border of \nBrazil Paraguay and Argentina and this \nis considered the most important open \nsource event here in the South America \nuh we usually have something around 5000 \nattendees from all around South America \nit's very very important event and it's \nvery communitarian that if you ever have \nbeen to force them it's similar to fazm \nbut on uh no not that big of a scale as \nfor them but it's a very uh very \nimportant event and I'm going to be \nthere I participate in this event for \nthe last 10 years already and this year \nI'll be there not only talking about \nviviate but also doing a workshop so if \nyou want it all the the talks are also \nonline but they are in Portuguese the \nmajority of them are in Portuguese and \nSpanish uh but if you want to to try \nyour your selfie Portuguese please uh \nfeel free to do that and also I'm going \nto be talking about uh are not related \nto Evie but also related to the deviate \nwhich is a Google summer of code so I'm \ngoing to have three very nice activities \nthere for the three days uh it will it \nwill happen at 18 through 20 of October \nuh so it's it's it's a three days \nconference and it's very intense uh and \nthat's not only about dolphins first \nlike open source software but also open \nHardware you have like people doing \ndesigning and it's a huge event with a \nlot of different activities that have uh \na place for everybody so join us and if \nyou want to to go there we are going to \nbe there so feel free to come \nuh \nlink so it's latinoware.org so \nother talks recorded so you might \nmention this yes yes we have there there \nis on YouTube we have a uh a Channel \nwith all the talks recorded so you can \ntry to follow that you know activate \nmaybe the the transcription and and \nfollow that \nawesome \nthe other day I saw on LinkedIn this uh \namazing \num Trend AI translator where it just \ntranslates your lip uh your lip uh uh um \nsynchronization and everything and \ntranslates what you say into a different \nlanguage pretty cool you should use it \nnice nice yeah we could test it out \nbecause we all speak perfectly \nPortuguese here right \nyears of listening to Bossa Nova \nprepared me for this conference oh good \ngood \nwell maybe the vocabulary doesn't cover \nit but that's fine \num and speaking of meeting us in \ndifferent places now is time maybe \nMarion uh you're involved in like \nkicking off like some of our Meetup \nactivities and uh exactly so you're \nsuper passionate about it \num and so \nyou share my screen then \nso yeah it's like woohoo so cycling we \ntalk a lot about Community contributions \nand also \num about the workshops so we have been \ngetting more and more questions when we \ncan meet in real life and we picked up \nthat feedback so oh that's interesting \nwe do have a couple of things going on \nthey are not all online yet but that is \nlike a sneak peek for like for the \npricing client now it's for the \ncommunity event so what's coming up and \nwe do have a meet-up in New York coming \nup this Zayn then talking uh about \nmulti-modality so watch out and \nSebastian is going to be there too so \nwatch out our um our website on the \nbottom of it you do find our meetups we \ndo have a workshop coming up in New York \nas well the next day where you can \nactually get your hands on \nin November we are going to be in Berlin \ntogether with our friends from Ivan \nagain like in London \num who has who knows uh we have been \nAnonymous as well and in December we are \ngoing to be in Berlin with the ml Ops \nCommunity \num and there's much much more in the \ncooking that it's just nothing it's so \nfinal that I would like to share it but \nkeep your eyes on our website we are \ngoing to announce it on LinkedIn and \nespecially in our meetup groups \nso yeah \nI'm looking forward to see you \nyay super exciting yeah because we \nalready talked about like we don't have \ndates yet for those places but yeah \nwe're talking about doing something in \nLondon probably Amsterdam exactly in San \nFrancisco there's actually something \nhappening in San Francisco about now \nanyway \num like right now it will be everywhere \nyeah right now right so uh shout out to \nPhilippe and Erica and Connor and the \nteam that are there and Adam \num that's why they're not in this in \nmovie there today because uh they're \nhustling and bustling somewhere else as \nwell so it's it's definitely gonna be a \nlot happening so we oh in San Francisco \nthere's one going on on October 2nd I \nactually forgot about that in San \nFrancisco there's one in October 2nd and \nMeetup is Haystack \ndefinitely worth joining and it's on our \nmeetup groups so again the v8.io and \nthen on the bottom you find our meetup \ngroups \nyeah yeah and they'll be with two one \nand uh tuana is such a great uh person \nas well so uh that'll be great yeah I'm \nso jealous of anyone that's going to be \nthere for that \nit's gonna be awesome \num perfect and then the final uh segment \nis again going back to do that uh going \nthrough some Community questions so we \nhave some questions that are like pop \npop up here and there and we said like \nhey maybe we could just have like a \nlittle conversation about them and then \nhelp you all out to kind of understand \nin case you also wondered about these \nthings \num so do that the first question that \nyou nominated is what is the impact of \nthe tokenization setting for a data \nproperty \nyes that's right and and also uh a nice \nuh a nice remembering that if you if you \nhave any questions on your journey to \nlearn about weaviate uh you can join us \nin the Forum you can go to the Wi-Fi \nwebsite and you can have their forums \nand also we we also have the hours like \nuh we are we are trying to move out the \nquestions to The Forum because that is \nflexible uh so whatever the the wherever \nthe content that we create on the Forum \nit stays there for other users to to \nsearch and to help themselves uh but we \nhave seen some questions and we will be \ntrying to to bring those questions here \nand try to to shade some light on it so \nthe idea is that sometimes people will \nsay hey I have I have a a query here I'm \nsearching for for something and I'm \ngetting some mixed results and that may \nbe because of the tokenization strategy \nfor your data property uh so let me \nshare and then we have uh \nbecause the the the property you can set \ndifferent tokenization properties for \nyour for your property right uh so \nshould I share my screen here just a \nlittle bit yeah that'll be great uh \nokay and while dude is doing that um I \nguess that probably relates to like not \na vector search right so tokenization \nthere's like two types of different \nindexes that get built with data in \nreview one is the um Vector index for \nsimilarity searching and then the other \nis an inverted index which a lot of \npeople are probably familiar with from \nkind of more traditional databases and \nthis I think relates to \num the inverted Index right data yes yes \nthat's right uh even though you have you \nmight confuse the tokenization with the \nvectorization and all that but this is \nmostly for the the hybrid or vm25 search \nuh so what happens is that by the fool \nwe have the the word as the tokenization \nright which means that it's going to to \nindex each word by itself but you have \ndifferent uh settings here and then the \nidea is that you need to change that \naccording to what you expect as a result \nright so bear in mind that we you can \nchange there's uh one more knob that you \ncan you can have a new Eva to change to \nto to to your specification uh so before \nthinking that it's not working properly \nuh when you're searching for for for uh \nyou're doing some queries you need to be \naware of this tokenization parameters \nthat it can influentiate in your in your \nqueries \nokay \nnice nice yeah \nso should we jump in a second question \nyeah we do have some questions that a \nlot of people are always asking how we \ncan because there's so much thing that \nyou can do with free V8 right you can \nnot only with tax but audio and video \nand all that together and then you can \nthrow some generative contents on top of \nthat and and then it's it gets really \ncrazy it gets a lot of possibilities and \na lot of people a lot of time uh people \nare asking what we can do where we can \nsee some examples on what we can do with \nreview it right and we do have a lot of \nexamples uh some of them are on the same \nplace but some of them are elsewhere uh \nthe first one that I want to show is \nthat we have some really nice recipes \nthat we are still growing there is still \nsome other examples that we can show so \nif you go to a repository and search for \nrecipes we are going to have their uh \ngenerative search Hybrid search \nIntegrations multi-tenancy and all all \nof them right now it doesn't have one \nfor for typescript but we are working on \nthat so soon we are going to have uh the \nsame examples with the same data and \neverything together for Python and also \nfor typescript another set of good \nexamples that we we have that you \nprobably saw there on the on the that's \nalso available for the the hacktoberfest \nis that we have alleviate examples and \nthese we have very nice very interesting \nexamples that we have done uh and our \ncommunity have contributed so for \nexample one that I really like is this \nattendance system example which you can \nhave uh I think there's some screenshots \nhere so basically you can have a \nscreenshot and then uh you can you can \nhave the people that is previously \ncreated on this screenshot and you can \nhave like an attendance like because \nconsider that you can take a picture of \nyour class and then map reason that \npicture and like uh \nthat's a very nice example we have here \nsome uh some players in another example \nthat I'm really excited is the audition \nclassification which is basically using \nthe the audio in order to identify the \nclass with some some other uh \nother previously \nexamples so all of them are registered \nhere is very easy if you have any \ntroubles uh playing around with those \nagain come to our forums we are there to \nhelp you another one that we have is \nanother is a different organization \naltogether we have Eva tutorials uh and \ninside this organization we have a lot \nof repositories with different uh parts \nof our of of codes and examples on how \nyou can those users are some like for \nfor example intro shop or how to ingest \nPDFs unstructured so there's a different \nset of of repositories there and the \nlast two there were I wouldn't like I \nwould like to show is a health search \nand this is a whole project that we have \nthat was created from from for our from \nour growth team uh so that's a very \ninteresting that it's using generative \nsearch to create reviews based on the \nreviews of the users so it's a very uh \nreal world example on how to use viviate \nwhich is very very fine very very fun to \nto use and very nice nicely done and the \nlast one is verba which we are \ndeveloping which is very interesting \nthat you can throw a lot of contents in \nthere and then you can search for those \nthose uh those contents and see where \nthey came from where the answer is \ncoming from and this is a very uh you \nknow a lot of a lot of people that comes \nto Eva they want to create this kind of \nof solutions at first like it's a very \ninteresting solution so here's a very \nnice way on how to do that and all of \nthose examples are there and again if \nyou have any troubles uh playing around \nwith that come to us we are here to help \nand we're we're going to be there on the \nforums on this lag on the email on the \nmeetups on every place trying to to help \nyou on your journey and that's it for \nfor those examples \nexcellent thank you for uh for for this \nand um I like I think this could be a \nnew tradition that we could always end \nup with like maybe a couple of questions \nfrom the community and then provide a \nbit of an insight and we'll definitely \nbe looking for any questions from like \nmaybe on our slack Etc like if you like \nus to answer you know like a \nconversational style this is definitely \nuh the way \nso this uh gets us to the end of this we \nget error it's been it's been a pleasure \nit's been great uh thank you all for \nyour time thank you for watching and \nthank you for listening whether you \nwatch with us live the show or whether \nyou're watching it like you know few \nhours or days after we've recorded it \ndefinitely thank you thank you very much \nfor your time we really appreciate it if \nif not for you we wouldn't be doing it \nright so uh if you enjoyed this video or \nany part especially if you loved \nRichard's demo give us a like uh that \nwill definitely help us out help us out \nplease subscribe to the channel I'll say \nit again because then you will not miss \nout the next movie there we do them \nevery month \nso um that's it for me so thank you very \nmuch uh thank you for your time and have \na great day bye bye bye \nsilly says bye bye Miss silly \n[Music] \nwait I thought I pressed and \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Air Episode 12", "path": "", "link":
