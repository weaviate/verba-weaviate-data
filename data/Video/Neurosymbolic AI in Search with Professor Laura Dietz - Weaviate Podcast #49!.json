{"text": "Hey everyone, thank you so much for watching the 49th episode of the Weaviate Podcast!! This podcast features Professor Laura ... \nhey everyone I'm super excited to \nwelcome Professor Laura Dietz from the \nUniversity of New Hampshire to the wevia \npodcast Professor Dietz is one of the \nworld's leading scientists in search \ntechnology and information retrieval and \nfirstly thank you so much for joining \nthe podcast \nthank you for having me \nawesome so I'm so excited to dive into \nthis topic of uh to open things up with \nneurosymbolic uh search and kind of I've \nalways been trying to wrestle my \nunderstanding of neurosymbolic how you \ncombine neural Technologies like deep \nlearning with symbolic systems like say \nmaybe knowledge graphs and tree \nalgorithms and all these things so uh \ncan you maybe open us up with maybe kind \nof just how you define neurosembolic AI \nbroadly and then maybe we could dive \ninto the search \nsure I think \nI mean most people think that it's very \ndifficult to combine these things \nbecause one sounds like hard facts and \nthe other one is called like soft \nprobabilistic thing \nwhere in reality a lot of like the \nsymbolic stuff also has like a soft \npublicistic notion like I did my PhD in \nprobabilistic models and you know you \nyou kind of like still have sort of like \nyou have access to both of those things \num I think for me what's maybe more \nimportant is \num words I don't like Words particularly \nin particular I always say I don't have \na lot of passion for these little words \num this is why I'm not an NLP Professor \nlike uh the prepositions and the \nconjunctions and all these little things \nsomebody needs to care about it and \nthat's not me but what I care about \nyourself like big picture things and \nthat's like what ultimately brought me \nto information retrieval which is sort \nof like a field I entered during my \nsecond postdoc \num it's like big picture thing hey here \nI have something I want to know and the \nthing over here could or could not be \nrelevant how can I bring these big \npicture things together rather than have \nlike little sentence by sentence with \nBarbara tasks so that's like that's not \nlike the thing that like I always liked \nand it took me a long time to realize \nthat I was like doing something like \ninformation retrieval already when I \nthought I was a machine learning \nscientist so \nso um uh you asked me about symbols so \nlike one I mean and symbols is kind of \nlike it's a very generic term like it \ncan mean whatever you think is a good \nsymbol for what you're trying to do \num like here more concrete example of a \nsymbol with let's say maybe uh what what \npeople call an entity link that's sort \nof like you have text and in the text \nyou have a mention of a thing that we \nall agree is a thing in the real world \nlet's say uh oysters okay \nwe can agree that oysters are a thing \nokay so now there are different things \nto say about oysters okay but like if \nyou have a text where uh that talks \nabout oysters a lot and you have \nsomebody wants to know about oysters but \nif you can spot that this text mentions \noysters and you can identify that \noysters are like relevant for what you \nwant to know then this oyster is not \njust a word but it's sort of like a \nparticular kind of thing \num and in particular maybe oyster the \nthing is different from our oyster shell \nyeah so like it's more than just the \nword but if you identify that oyster is \na thing in the text now that kind of \nlike helps you sort of like cope with \nall the kind of like Witnesses in \nnatural language or like synonyms for \nlistening \num needs for disambiguation different \nways of phrasing the same things using \ncompletely different words you sort of \nlike I call it sort of like a landmark \nin text that can like latch onto and it \nkind of gets me half of the way towards \nlike what I want to do to like help \nusers find what they're looking for so \nthat's kind of like maybe like a very \nconcrete thing of like why I'm \ninterested in symbols \nnow \nso I keep going yeah you know I'm a \nprofessor so you give you like a one \nhour 20 minute monologue if you don't \nstop me \num so you ask about like neurosymbolic \nright so some of us talking about like \nsymbols right like then um I think a lot \nof like current work in newer methods is \nkind of like about like words and \ndealing with sort of like vectors based \nembeddings kind of thing you know and \nlike similarity in the vector space \nthat's supposed to like capture some \nkind of meaning and we can just put the \nsymbols in there as well you know if we \ncan do like a word is sort of like a \nhard thing right if you think of a word \nas a symbol we know how to represent \nwords in a neural network space so the \nsymbols are just like \nadditional words right so we can like do \nthe same thing that we've done to words \nand we can again represent them a latent \nspace so that's like no problem no \nproblem on that side but it's a natural \nfit it's just like maybe the way that we \nthink about words is a little bit more \nlike fluid uh and the way that we think \nabout symbols is a little bit more rigid \num \nso I guess my question is I've always \nhad a hard time understanding this kind \nof like entity parsing out I get like so \nmaybe just take a step back like with \nthe oyster example I I always have kind \nof thought that like kind of the vectors \ncapture the semantics of the oysters so \nmaybe like clams or mussels I like \nsimilar Foods kind of so it depends on \nthe context or I don't know too much \nabout oysters but maybe if you're like \nfishing them so so maybe could you help \nme understand like how the entity \nparsing \nuh like how how it plays with search \nkind of \nwell I mean there's like um towards \nworking with aunties they are kind of \nlike two parts but one is you have text \nand the text is just words um to \nidentify which of these words actually \nrefer to like \nuh oysters and like particular oyster \nversus oyster shell \num \nthen I think once you know that it's \nlike you can like take entities as \nadditional words and you can like \ninclude them in you know your relevance \nmodel to identify what's is it on topic \nis it off topic um \num they're kind of like some other \nadvantages where you know often they're \nlike Tethered to like a knowledge graph \nor some databases or some other external \nknowledge um and even even just like if \nyou have like small spelling variations \nif you just ever look at words you have \nsort of like a question about this \ninvigoration \num maybe oyster isn't like that but \nlet's say you have David Smith in the \ntext and you have another text also talk \nabout David Smith right we don't know \nare these the same David Smith is so \nlike \num somebody that we don't even like know \nabout like this is all like we're \nentities this invigoration is like very \nvery critical especially with like \npeople names and uh place names \nespecially since the Americans decided \nthat like every European Town also needs \nto be placed in the US so now that's \nkind of like you know that's like it can \nbe can be very hairy problems right \num but even like other things like um \ntime right so when I say time and I \ndon't give any further context like you \nknow or we probably talk about the thing \non the clock but like time I like you \nknow their Pink Floyd song called time \nit drove me nuts like was like very very \nmad at Pink Floyd for a while \num so can we think of stuff like being \nlike it's undisputably like when I say \none word that's the thing but like if \nyou look at text and if you look at it \nin detail it's not necessarily clear \nthat the thing that mentions the right \nname is actually the right thing so \nso when you actually go through the \nmechanics of like entities invigoration \nsaying is this time thing on the clock \nis it time the work of art \nnow you can like add this to your \ndocument representation and the next \ntime I want to know about like time the \nPink Floyd song \nI can sort of like directly go to my \nsearch index and grab out these pieces \nof text we've already put in some work \nin well I know that this is the here in \nthis context we we refer to the Pink \nFloyd song so that's sort of like where \nyou can really like add additional \nknowledge \num something that people like often \nthink like I think or like maybe like 15 \nyears ago people thought uh Hey named \nentity recognition which is not \ndisinfiguration it's just like here's \nthe text oh that looks like a place that \nlooks like a person and they were trying \nto like make gain some leverage out of \ninformation retrieval and it didn't work \nand the reason why it didn't work is \nkind of like obvious in hindsight \num but just while you know in search \nyou're really focusing on the words \nuh the words already there the reason \nlike like the way that you identify that \nthese are people names is because \nthey're particular words things like it \nyou can look up like in gazetteer or \nsomething so you're not really adding \nanything to the knowledge there's very \nfew very few general terms just like \nhave people names in it and if there's \noften like an organization or maybe a \nplace or something so just like the \nrecognition part like or like mention \ndetection is also called \num it's like not that useful for search \nhowever once you have like these entity \nlinks they're sort of like you know you \ndisambiguate dimension in the text and \nsay is this person \nit's this thing well it's like it's time \nthe song versus like time the general \nconcept now that happens to be like \nreally useful in information retrieval \nand and I think my my second side of the \nmost cited work is actually about like \nshowing that this works in information \nretrieval together with like Jeffrey \nDalton and like James Allen from humans \num and I think it was really like well \nwe kind of like it was off like a tight \nrace you know the the market was ripe \nfor doing this kind of work where we had \ngood entity linking technology we had \nsome benchmarks that kind of like would \nalso like to you would do better on if \nyou would identify these entities \num and that's what we did so like the \none thing you just like toss it in and \nit makes everything better so I mean \nthat's like uh that's that's always a \ngreat thing if you have a great model \nsomething it really works you just add a \nsecret ingredient and everything goes up \nand that was like one of them right so \nand I think again that's also something \nwe sense in hindsight because if you're \ninterested in time in the Pink Floyd \ncontext it's not the most frequent \nmention of time in the context you can \nuh immediately discard all the mentions \nfor time as the clock and like focus in \non the text that kind of like really \ntalks about the word time in the right \ncontext \nso if I have a query like um when was \ntime published uh something like that \nand so I'm kind of I'm still trying to \ntry to wrap my head around kind of the \nsystem architecture and how the system \nworks so would you maybe first do a \nvector search with the embedding of that \nphrase uh uh when was time published I \nremember what I had started \nand then and then would you say like re \nlike filter the outputs because you then \nrun the entity parser over the candidate \noutputs to say okay these these \nmentioned time the uh Pink Floyd song \nyeah so I think \nlike this is not the machine learning me \nspeaking um I think usually the best \nmodel is one that kind of does all these \nthings at the same time we call those \nlike joint inference model \num and like what neural networks do with \nend-to-end training and end-to-end \ninference it's like like the same idea \nright \num I think if you would like write a \nsystem that goes into production \nuh number one talk to somebody else \nnumber two do you have like two routes \nin which you can like go you can either \nfirst look at all of your collection one \nin entity link on all of those then \nindex some information of the entities \nalong with words \nand these are now not I mean that's kind \nof like logical identifiers you know \npeople use you know Wikipedia titles or \nWiki data IDs or like whatever matches \nin like your entity \num like entities in the world that you \ncare about \nnow you can like take like any typical \nretrieval model that of your choice and \njust so extend it with like entities \nokay that's sort of like the search part \nuh the really hard part like to actually \nidentify what is relevant for what the \nuser wants to know \nright like I mean if uh if a user wants \nto know hey what is like healthy versus \nunhealthy Seafood I haven't mentioned \noyster in that like information need but \nlike maybe talking about oysters whether \nit's good for you maybe there might be \nsome health risk associated then \num yeah it was like making that link \nsaying this is like what the user said \nthe user did not know that they wanted \nto know about oysters I mean that's okay \nthose information needs exist but we \nusually consider themselves like the \nreally hard part is are like those where \nthe stuff that's like really relevant \nthat really kind of like shows the right \nkind of information and like really \nbetter information than you would get \notherwise \num I just like based on stuff that is \nlike not that obvious I love like the \nmachine learning inference embedding \ntechniques are like about how can I \nbring the words that I used in the query \nsort of like similar to the words that \nactually in the real relevant documents \nif we would know what that is of like a \n2020 hindsight kind of thing and we \ntrain on that and again like this \ngesture here is something that I uh like \nexercise a lot in my class so it's like \nwe have these things they're like they \nlook like very separate \nand whatever we do with like Machinery \ntechniques we try to bring the right \nthings together \nand we push the wrong things apart right \nand I think this is like also where \num like latent space embeddings that \nlike neural networks give us it's like \nsuch a great fit because you can like \nreason Beyond just like lexicon matching \nbut just like how the world prior to \nlike neural networks kind of like really \nwere \num and really like try to have some \nsemantic meaning of this is similar than \nthat right and that's like something \nthat you also like said earlier about \nwell there's an information need there \nare all these different things like I \nwant to know that oyster here is similar \nto other things that uh they may find at \nthe beach or like that I find in the sea \nor I find in the water or something but \nlike the real and I mean that's also \nlike you know the like an often sided \nuh advantage of doing the symbolic thing \nespecially when you have knowledge \ngraphs at the backgrounds that you have \nlike the taxonomy so you know an oyster \nis a this and that and that you have the \nwhole taxonomy that you can leverage uh \nif you have Wikipedia things you have \nthese categories that try to be like \noverlapping sets it's a little bit more \nmessy than like a nice static tree \num which can help in some cases \num \nthe big problem that we're usually \nfighting with is \num it's only like helpful in like some \nof the cases just because the taxonomy \nisn't always the right thing that the \nright kind of group of things \num let's say \num sea creatures you know we have like \nthe nice taxonomy of like oh uh oysters \nare part of like fall in with muscles \nand they are like this and that and they \ndon't quiz me on the biology but like \nsometimes I just want to say uh things \nthat like live in the water and they \noften isn't like a nice type for it or \nthere isn't a nice category for it and \nthat's like when step when stuff gets \nlike hard and unfortunately \nI want to say that um yeah I sent a \nbunch of students down the wrong Rabbit \nHole trying exactly that and they're \nlike I don't know stuff isn't really \nworking so well and then we looked very \ncarefully I was like yeah Works in some \ncases but like often uh there isn't like \nan easy solution like just walking up \nthe taxonomy tree that's like where \nwe're doing like love like an infant \nlike on the spot and so on like \nidentifying what is the right set of \nentities \nyeah this I think there's so much to \nunpack I I remember uh Bob and light at \nweavier when he was telling kind of the \nfounding story of weavier it started as \na semantic uh web technology and um he \ntells a story that he was at a \nconference and they and people couldn't \nagree on what was a lake or what was a c \nand this kind of like trying to form \nontologies people can't agree on what \nwhat the vocabulary for things but uh \nyou you mentioned kind of the embedding \noptimization you know push things \nsimilar push other things apart and so \nI'm really trying to understand kind of \nthe role of knowledge graphs with the \ncurrent Vector search technology is \nmaybe the strategy to link the data \nsymbolically based on you know maybe \nshared entity mentions or however you \nlink the knowledge graph and then from \nthere you you do like Knowledge Graph \nembeddings could that be maybe the \nfuture of embeddings or at least I see \nsorry to be going on a little bit but I \nsee kind of two two things of this where \nit could be either like you know you you \nyou take a zero shot embedding model \nlike the pre-trained open AI cohere nice \nlike long list of pre-trained model \nproviders \nand then you kind of uh you know form an \nontology about your particular data and \nthen you have some kind of like \nKnowledge Graph embedding orchestration \nthing that that is like maybe the new \nstate of the art for how you get the \nbest embeddings is that maybe how you're \nthinking about it or \nquite honestly it's uh an open research \nquestion I'd like I think one of the \nreasons why we are giving the tutorial \nseries on like neurosymbolic \nrepresentations for information \nretrieval is because we want to also get \nmore people to think about this \num typically the people that we talk to \nfall into two camps \none says you don't need knowledge graphs \nwe just have like neural methods and \nthey just like figure everything out \nthat's one way I mean and then and I'm \nnot like you know I'm not saying sorry \nyou're wrong right like I wouldn't say I \nthink it's like it's a possible \nhypothesis like you don't like need any \nof the symbolic stuff anymore if you \nhave the right neural network \num I think on the other side you would \nhave people would say \num \nyou know we have all that knowledge \nsitting around here for free why not \nutilize it why not like work on trying \nto make it work right then you have like \nthe other Camp saying oh yeah well we \ntried a bunch of these things and it \ndoesn't really help and I was like well \nwhat kind of things exactly did you try \nyou know think about it like you know \nthe the technology like advances like if \nyou use um a call that's like a \nprescription strength neural network \nsuper optimized by like you know Decades \nof work that open AI put into something \nand then you um have a few really like \nPoor Man's entity features they're not \ngonna cut it right it's like David \nversus Goliath right no what you do need \nis like prescription strength entity \nlinking and entity ranking methods to \nactually kind of like make a dent here \nright so this is like where we're \ncurrently in this parallel track phase \nwhere one says oh you know we tried it \nall and like doesn't really work it's \nlike not worth our time they have other \npeople like me who said no no if you \never want to kind of like go out of our \nlocal research option them if you want \nto escape that we do need to push \nfurther and like as long as we haven't \nas long as the last researcher hasn't \ngiven up hope we're gonna like plow in \nthe direction and we kind of like pull \nresources and we like see whether maybe \nthere's a way here to like make make \nsome Headway \num but in 2023 we don't exactly know \nright and I think \num I think the other thing to us like be \naware of that \nthere are so many different fields that \nlike work with knowledge graphs \nand they all work ultimately with \ndifferent problems and different problem \nsets like if you have your less courage \nlike talking about like knowledge crafts \nyou think about it like in one \nparticular way which is often like you \nknow Knowledge Graph completion finding \nthese links \nbut like this is not really the essence \nwhat you need in information retrieval \ninformation retrieval you need a \ndifferent kind of set of Technology both \nof those are working on knowledge graphs \nbut the purpose in the I call it like \nthe texture of the prediction problem is \nlike very very different \num to give you an example an information \nretrieval we always work in the setting \nthat during training time we don't know \nsearch requests that we will see in the \nfuture \nthis is where a lot about like \ninformation retrieval and like the \nmachine learning methods that's being \nused is all about similarity learning \nand particular the lexical similarity \nlearning because like uh today we're \ngoing to talk about oysters and tomorrow \nwe're gonna be talking about like green \nsea turtles \nyou might have never seen a word like a \nquery that talks about anything as green \nor C or Turtle during training time \nyou cannot focus just on the words \ninstead you need to figure out like what \nare the things like like if I if I \nchange my information need if I change \nmy search query which other words will \nthat bring closer to this one so you \ncannot do something like a like Alexa \nclassifier like a classified that looks \nat word features and TF IDF features \nthis is not how it works you first need \nto like have some means of like \nsimilarity I mean I'm always saying we \nbriefly glance at the words in the query \nand the words and the document and then \nfrom very instantly go into like \nsomething that is a similarity \nand that Trend goes like back as long as \nTF IDF and Boolean search right it's \nlike we quickly look at what's in there \nand instantly return it like in this \nsimilarity metric and that's like still \nthe case like today with the neural \nnetwork methods that we use information \nretrieval like I think dense passage \nretrieval or like by by encoder my mind \nI can't even think of it as the same \nthing but you briefly look at the query \nyou embedded you briefly look at the \ndocument you embedded and now this \nproximity Is ultimately like metric \nlearning as it's as it's core now there \nare different kinds of metric learning \nas uh there's like some big toolkit that \nlike claims to do everything of metric \nlearning where students tried it it \ndidn't really work for IR cases \num and when I look at the model I'm like \nyeah okay I understand why this model is \na good metric learning for this one \nclass of problems \nhere we have another class of problems \nit's not very surprising if it's like \nyou know you kind of like still I mean \nthe devil is in the details and you like \nneed to look at exactly what is your \nmodel leveraging what is your what is \nyour unfair Advantage if you're a \nmachine learning model to kind of like \ndo bet better in your task now you \nchange the task completely and you will \nfind that different things work better \nand you find that maybe you kind of \nactually really need a different model \nhere \nyeah I really want to um get it I want \nto come back to the entity linking and \nhow that happens but I really want to \nunderstand entity ranking a bit more and \nhow that uh Works \num maybe if we could unpack two kind of \nCutting Edge ideas in the representation \nlearning space uh the first idea I'd \nlike to talk to you about is Colbert so \nColbert is like uh in addition to having \nthe the vector that represents the whole \npassage you also would do the you keep \nthe token representation you keep the \nvectors for each of the tokens and then \nyou have this late interaction so I so \nso I'm thinking as I think about entity \nranking I think I have a query or I have \na query like what was Barack Obama's \nLegacy right and so I have Barack Obama \nas I have this uh maybe a single entity \nvector or I have these kind of two \nvectors from the tokens like like I I \njust like like what does entity ranking \nhow does it look like uh as an algorithm \nsure \num \nlike in genuine that's like neural \nversus not neural dad likes of like \nthree branches of of entity information \npeople are utilizing \none is like what you said you take the \ncurry you're entitling the curry now you \nknow oh here we have this person name we \nknow that person it's in bikini data \nunder qid something something \nuh that's like one way \num another way is to \nsort of like retrieve stuff oh no \nactually like uh um retrieve stuff look \nwhich entities are in there and like try \nto identify what's in the knowledge \ngraph and like use the knowledge like I \nmean okay um hold on I kind of like \nmixing everything one is like \nanti-linking the query the second one is \ntake the query \nhave your knowledge graph indexing \nKnowledge Graph knowledge it's like very \ntextural you just like shove that in \nyour search index you take the query you \nretrieve from that search index \num one way of doing that one is take \nWikipedia toss it in a search index \nretrieve a page every page you retrieve \nrefers to an entity \nnow you get like entities this way these \nentities might not just be the Obamas \nthese entities might be uh White House \nor something \num the Third Way which um spoiler alert \nis actually the best way in our \nexperience is you take your search \nrequests \nfirst you retrieve passages \ntext passages form a corpus of your \nchoice you can also do that with \nWikipedia that actually works better \nthan just trying to directly retrieve \nPages interestingly you can also do it \nwith the open web and so on so forth \npassages \nnow you look which entities are linked \nin these passages \nokay and you can do some kind of \nanalysis and this is like where the \ndifferent methods like this deviate \num so you look at these passages in the \nranking \nyou identify what like the frequent \nmentioned entities which are NT says so \nclose to the query words and so on so \nforth you do a bunch of analysis and \nthat's another way of like finding out \nwhich entities are relevant and these \nentities are often actually really \nsurprisingly \num much more robust or stable than \nanything else like \nwhy does it work so well okay like \nnumber one anti-linking the query you do \nthe same thing that we did with uh name \nentity recognition originally right \nyou're not really adding additional \nwords sometimes you add some more names \ncan sometimes help but most of the time \nthe person name needs to be sufficiently \nalready disambiguate in the words for \nyou to actually be able to entity link \nit and there are a whole bunch of people \nthat work just on entity Link in the \nquery which just requires a few \ndifferent twists right or at least \ndifferently trained models for it this \nway \num so with anti-ling the query I don't \nthink you add a ton of new information \nit's a smidge and it depends but like \nit's not where the real cake is a future \nfrom the knowledge graph \nso now it depends how good your \nknowledge graph is now the problem is \num like if your knowledge graph is \ncoming from Wikipedia and if you look at \nthe first two paragraphs on the \nWikipedia page before they start with \nthe section and so on it's very very \nshort brief description of this entity \nthis will mentioned the most important \nfacts that people typically want to know \nabout this entity \nuh let's take South America \ndo you know any South America facts \nuh maybe largest rainforest in the world \nin Brazil let's start with maybe it's um \nit's not a country but it's like a \ncontinent right and it has different \ncountries uh yeah rainfall is probably \nanother good one um so interestingly \num I don't know it's been a while back \nbut remember the the zika outbreak and \nlike I think it was like 2015 it was \nlike big in the news right interestingly \nand it happened where South America \nnow uh guess what is not mentioned on \nthe Wikipedia page of South America at \nleast last time I checked \nEzekiel breaks and why is that hmm \nmaybe somebody like is like removing \nfacts from like certain pages I don't \nknow \num maybe they're just like more \ninteresting things to say about South \nAmerica than the zika outbreak okay so \nif you however go to like the Wikipedia \npage that describes zika fever and the \nzika outbreak well they've mentioned \nlike South America South America South \nAmerica various kinds of like \num South American countries right it's \nlike oh no it's you know it's here and \nwe have like this many people kind of \nlike affected by here and there right so \nthis is ultimately like why the third \npart of your first retrieve \nbecause yeah if you want to know about \nthe zika fever right you can't start \nretrieving and you're getting a bunch of \npasses that talk about like the about \nzika the zika fever \num about like different like medical \ndetails or biomedical functioning or \nPathways and so on right and about like \nthe outbreak and like how tragic it was \nand how it affected like so many \ndifferent lives especially of pregnant \npeople you know so um \nif you retrieve those first and those \nare pretty easy to retrieve now if you \nlook which entities are in there you see \nlike South America is definitely like \ndominating so in this example about like \noh tell me about the zika fever or like \nwhere did the whether we have thicker \nfever outbreaks \num you will not find but like you will \nnot find South America by entity linking \nthe query because it's not mentioned \nyou will not find it by retrieving from \nthe knowledge base because the knowledge \nbase finds all kinds of other things uh \nbut probably not South America if you go \nand like you retrieve from the from \neither Wikipedia or the open web look \nwhat you need to say in there there you \nhave it South America right and and this \nis just like in and this is a story that \nwe've seen like time and time again in \num in like our research where with \ndifferent kind of benchmarks and so on \nso forth like this is really where \nthere's like bottom up you first \nretrieve some Snippets that like seem to \nbe about the query Curry first \nthen analyze whatever you get back to \nidentify which entities are very \nrelevant and this is um \nyeah various of my students kind of like \nfine again and again that that's like a \ngood that's a good way of doing it \num \nyeah that that's super interesting and \nthat that's a really clear example of um \nof when you would do that kind of \nKnowledge Graph retrieval my question \nwith this has always been uh I've I've \nnever really understand understood how \nthese query languages for knowledge \ngraphs work but I think I think maybe \nwith the like kind of the text to SQL is \nlike kind of what I see as a related \nbranch of research where uh the large \nlanguage model can take a natural \nlanguage question and then turn it into \nlike an SQL query and so I imagine we'll \nstart to see the same kind of thing but \nwith you know maybe Cipher or these kind \nof Knowledge Graph rdf languages and so \ndo you do you think that's that maybe \nthe like the large language models will \nknow how to take uh the query of where \nwas the zika virus originated and then \nturn it into the the graph query and \nthen \nyou know take advantage of the \nTechnologies better \nyeah that will be that would be great \num \nso far we find that this like only works \nin like very constrained environments \nright and this is like where \nthe the search domain that you're trying \nto support really matters a lot here \nlike if it's uh if it's something where \nwhich is very very well represented by a \nknowledge graph \nyeah you do it I mean there's like all \nthis question answering over linked data \nit's a thing and they can like do really \nwell on questions that's of like fit \nwell with the schema \nthe big problem is what do you do when \nthe schema doesn't match \nright so and um and I think this is like \nme being in a as a more General IR \nresearcher working with like General IR \nbenchmarks we find that very often it \nlike doesn't match I remember \num like a couple of years back we did \nsome study in trying to \nsee um I would think we were trying to \nuse in um open IE relation extraction \nsystem now that system was was designed \nto like extract relations about like \npeople and organizations and places but \nnot so much about butterflies and \nflowers and like um water pollution \nthings like that right so we try to make \nsome use of that technology on a very \ngeneral like IR Benchmark I think it was \nwas probably something like clue web or \ntrack web or something \num and like me my student we looked at \nthe search queries and I think one was \nlike fall activities for children we're \nlike you can give up the schema will not \nbe able to answer those kind of like \nquestions right so we focus then on the \nfew queries it was probably like 40 of \nthem where we had actually any hope on \nit \num but it was still like like an upper \nbattle right like I think um like if you \nasked the \num akbc crowd like automatic knowledge \nbased construction even they you know \nthey went from triples like subjects \npredicate objects like entity entity how \nthey connected \nto uh hear a bunch of vectors by then \nthey've been doing that one for a long \ntime right no no kind of like the things \nlike you can then turn these vectors \ninto triples if that's like what you \nprefer and like they're actually \napplication for that but you can also \njust like directly work with these \nvectors and they have like absorbed that \nknowledge sitting in the vectors you \nmaybe don't need triples explicitly \nanymore \num yeah \nI mean I think like nowadays what we \nhave and I think one thing um that my \ncolleague Hannah based she's a professor \nat University of Freiburg \num and she's working a lot in the inter \nlike like comic combining text noted \ntext bases and like knowledge based more \nstructural knowledge bases \num one thing that she found out was like \nyou know the GPT \nEtc models right like that and you think \nlike you know you kind of ask it hey can \nyou take that natural question and run \nit as a sparkle queries like Knowledge \nGraph \nshe said like crunchy what she finds is \nit generates perfect vaco which you know \nit's like a very complicated query \nlanguage like very few humans can \nactually \ncan actually like write \ngood Sparkle by hand like I give up on \nthat it's like not my it's like not my \nforte but they can write perfect Sparkle \nit like once it's syntactly correct \nbut then often you get an empty result \nset \nand then she did again and like new \nSparkle Curry again empty this outside \nthen you tell the model hey your results \nis empty how do I need to change it to \nto find something and we know that there \nare elements that exist \nand again it generates something and \nagain the results it's empty and like I \ndon't I don't want to cite this as like \na oh this is so bad technology we \nshouldn't even give it a try it's quite \nthe opposite I think I think it's like \nthese are great times to be alive right \nit's like it's it's like uh it was like \nnearly Unthinkable maybe a year ago then \nuh you can have you can give a question \nand it will generate some sparkle that \nkind of like looks believable is \nactually correct syntactically correct \nbut that's like a huge accomplishment \nthat like you know blows everybody out \nof the water right \num but it's like also there's like you \nknow open questions right and and I mean \nit was like not be able to overcome the \nsituation where the schema just \ncompletely does not match what you want \nand this is like where \nwe currently in my research group we \nkind of like focus more on this like uh \nunstructured we have the text we know \nhow Knowledge Graph extraction would \nwork in theory so we can like include \nthis information just to read the text \nfor us and pull out the important pieces \nand then we get an entity ranking this \nway so it's sort of like um there's a \nlot about like finding out like how \nresearch and other areas work which most \npeople don't like to do because it's \npainful \num but like we're \nthe the kind of like the unstructured \napproach that we focus on is mostly it's \nnot because we didn't want to work with \nknowledge graphs but because like \nwhenever we tried it didn't work on like \nAya benchmarks very well and that's \ncertainly also like maybe the fault at \ntrying to do uh say general purpose \nKnowledge Graph where um and maybe it's \nalso like at four make my preference um \nabout like search queries my favorite \nsearch queries um is maybe also at fault \nhere because I'm sorry I don't care \nabout people \nI don't care about people careers I \ndon't want to know anything about any \ncelebrities like I there may be like two \nactors in the world that can actually \nrecognize \num and I just like it's just like not \nreally proud of my interest like my \ninterest is in like Popular Science \nenvironmental topics social topics and \nfor those we don't really have love like \ngreat knowledge crafts with us like work \nthere \num so that's like one of the reasons why \nwe find it's not working that doesn't \nmean it's not working statically it just \nmeans it's like it doesn't work for this \nlike very open domain \nsoft topics that are just like we know \nare not very well represented by \nknowledge craft so but kind of like \nbecause I like those queries and I think \nthese careers like deserve to be \nanswered well \num and whenever I use a search engine I \nfind myself just being highly frustrated \nin not finding the stuff that I want to \nknow especially when I want to learn \nabout something new like there's sort of \nlike a teachable moment that's like \nreally wasted so this is like why we \nwork on these like \nopen \nvague complex information needs that \nalso like happen to be not well covered \nby knowledge graphs but if you find \nyourself working on some like \nwell-covered areas like um people in \nbiographies or like um about companies \nand like maybe like financial \ninformation and so on or in the \nbiomedical domain where you know ncbi \nhas a very very expensive like knowledge \nbase very little very spots on the text \nbut very high on the structure much more \nthan like Ricky data \num \num then that's like like the way to go \nso it's that's something it depends on \nthe domain what works and what doesn't \nyeah it's so interesting um all these \nknowledge graphs that I think like \nwikidata has been curated by humans with \nthe relations and stuff and there's a \nlot I want to parse out but first I want \nto get your opinion on another Knowledge \nGraph that's really captured my \nattention which is uh it's from a group \nat Harvard biomedical informatics called \nuh Prime kg so Prime kg is like 130 000 \nnodes which are like drugs proteins \ndiseases and then they have roughly five \nmillion edges between each others like \ndrug drug interaction drug protein \ninteraction \num yeah but well yeah maybe quickly uh \nwhat do you think about that kind of \nKnowledge Graph and the applications of \nit \num I don't know \nwe like comment \num you said like a hundred thousand \nentities \nthat doesn't like me like a whole lot \nquite honestly right I think \num if you look at ncbi there's like it's \nlike such a big deal so it's really like \na engineering challenge like work with \nit right like um \nso again like um yeah but I think you \nknow if you really like work in uh \npharmacology they really like need to \nknow about like the interactions I mean \nit's a very again a very like narrow \ndomain \nbut maybe this is really like what you \nwant to know and I think that's also \nsomething for \num bigger isn't always better especially \nwhen it comes to knowledge graphs like \num like what I said my initial example \nwas like time the Pink Floyd song versus \ntime the thing on the clock \num if you if you know that you're not \ninterested in works of art \nand \nthen it's not a question anymore right \nlike you the disambiguation problem just \nlike goes away because there's now only \nlike one meaning of time \num so I think like by if you if you can \nsort of like identify that oh yes a nice \ncrap but he's just like the the subject \nsection it's actually even like relevant \nfor what my users are needing and if you \nwant to if you want works a lot you \nwould go to a different kind of like \nsoftware right so this is like the \nsituation that you find yourself in here \nwhere you have knowledgecraft very very \nspecific targeting one particular task \nthat's important \nmotion also kind of like in some ways \nlike simplifies things and I'm always \nlike a fan of like you don't need to \nmake your life hard unnecessarily so \num \nmaybe pivoting topics a little bit but \nI'm I've always I think one of the \nbiggest Trends in search with these new \nsearch engines like perplexity and \nyou.com and of course like vva we build \nthis under the hood is like this kind of \nlike filtered Vector search where you \nmight pick a particular source of data \nto search through so say you want to \nsearch through Wikipedia Reddit Twitter \nor you know PubMed particularly and so \nto me that's one kind of structure \nthere's it's not necessarily uh linked \nin a graph it's just kind of like you \nadd uh you know symbolic attributes of \nof the source to the unstructured data \nwhat do you think about that kind of AD \nsymbolic data to unstructured data to \nthen kind of filter the search with \noh yeah I mean I think like adding \nmetadata uh I think it should go without \nsaying like I think a lot of like works \non um \nI think initial works on trustworthiness \nbefore we landed in that like very \nheated political thing right like people \nsaid here A bunch of like news sources \nthat we generally trust hear a bunch of \nlike you know scientific schools that we \ngenerally trust \num you usually put a lot of trust on \nWikipedia so if somebody like asked us \nfor anything we prefer those sources and \nlike only if you can't find anything \nhere then we might get into the weeds um \nI think maybe in today's climate maybe \nyou want to kind of like uh first \nidentify what's your user which side are \nthey leaning towards and then like show \nthem the sources that they might usually \nuh prefer to see to like avoid a bunch \nof heart attacks right that's like \nanother example of kind of like being um \nfocused and selecting like by The Source \num \nI know that some people were like trying \nto like predict when which source is \nlike the most appropriate \nhmm \num I think from what I've seen it's not \nmy core area but like from what I've \nseen like the best thing is to \num essentially like use your user model \nor like you use Case Model like are we \ncurrently asking about health or are we \ncurrently asking about like oysters then \num like you step onto like to select the \nresource and then maybe like do some \nlike meta search and like merging a few \nsources that are kind of like \nappropriate right \num that would be kind of like um if I \nwould have to do that in practice that's \nuh how we'll be doing it \num I think as a research problem \nI would probably stick with that \nI'm not thanking my research time on it \nand not my students time either \nyeah awesome That's so exciting and yes \nI think that was a really really \ncomprehensive tour of the of \nneurosymbolic searches understanding \nentity ranking well oh sorry there was \none more thing I wanted to pick your \nbrain about which is entity linking and \nI think because I think with the large \nlanguage models we can now prompt it to \ntake like two passages and then output \nlike how they're related is that is that \na breakthrough in energy linking what's \nkind of been the story of this \nyeah \nI haven't done any empirical work with \nlike the latest models right like I \nthink you can ask like the other \nregressive language models to like \nannotate your the text that they \ngenerate with like entity links and they \nclaim they do that I don't know about \nthe accuracy \num I think \num for a long time the anti-linking \ncommunity really like focused on like \nlinking every single entity in text \nwe're from an IR resource standpoint I'm \nlike you should ideally link those \nConcepts that really matter in the \ncontext \num here's an example uh there's a \nWikipedia page about the word the \nth \nwhatever the link every single mention \nof the yeah like you might have some \ntext that actually talks about the as an \nimportant concept and now you do want to \nlink it \nright so uh I call this like a query \nspecific or context specific entity \nlinking and I think that's kind of like \nimportant right \num like another thing that I think is \nreally important is like to go on a sub \nentity level \nlike uh oyster like we have actually \nsome research area \num a multiple things to say about \noysters you know you can oyster it's an \nanimal some people forget that it's an \nanimal it's an animal not vegetarian \nfood some people \num say well there are sort of like some \nhint that it kind of like actually can \nlike filter the water and can help with \nsome of like cleanup of polluted water \nsources \num but then it's also like a thing that \nyou can eat right there is a different \nconcept contests so can we identify that \nin a text where we know all oysters \nmentioned here and we have an entity \nlink to the right oyster or maybe even \nlike David Smith you know it's like \nsomething we have that anti-linking \nfirst can we identify what's the context \nwhich aspect of an entity is actually \nmentioned in that context \nuh it turns out you can \nin terms of if you do that you actually \nkind of like have another kind of like \nyou know another another hammer in your \nhand that is saying you have the big \nhammer that's like entity and \nanti-league you have the small Hammer \nthat like it's like no here's this is \nlike oyster the food that's being \nmentioned here and here we have oyster \nas you know a creature that has a \nhabitat and a home and the family to \nreturn to \num uh so then because that now tells you \nthat at least two pieces of text \nalthough they mention the same entity \ntalk actually about different things \nabout this entity \num and that's something where we've kind \nof like we've shown like some initial \npromise but then there's also like more \nwork that needs to be done in this area \nlike how can we identify how can we \nleverage this like fine-grained entity \nlinking right but of course you know the \nthe knowledge graph embedding can help \nus with all of this right \num \nand and I think you know like the \nanother thing you ask about like how \ngood are they at entity linking we know \nthat like earlier models like bird are \nactually not very good at it I'm always \nsaying like \num like I remember in 2019 people \nthought oh Bert can do everything \nthe train predominantly on Wikipedia \ntherefore it should be able to do all \nthese entities and I think over the past \nlike two three years we found out like \nno this is actually not true it's \nactually like birth is not very good at \nrepresenting entities like because it's \nalso like and if you think about how \nit's trained with a closed task \num you simply random word the chance \nthat you get a you know common word like \na preposition or conjunction \num it's just like very high \num it's much higher than sampling what I \ncall an information bearing word like \nyou know you can think like rare words \nthat like tfidf would like \num also there's like fine-tuned with \ncertain kind of like other tasks that \nare often very like lexico or like T5 \nwhich is like trained on you know glue \nand super glue which are all like NLP \ntasks very lexical you need to really \nunderstand the words to like do well on \nthose tasks where \num something I've been trying to do with \na couple of collaborators is to maybe \neven train a new even like an \nold-fashioned birth model \nfrom an academic budget just like undo a \nfew changes and see whether you actually \nend up with a model that actually works \nmuch better and also like an IR in \ngeneral certainly a model that's better \nat representing like entities \num and like part of this is like on in \nthe tokenizer your brother has a \ndifferent token as into preserving but \nthen there's still like a bunch of like \nother \nI don't want to call them mistakes I'm \njust saying stuff that choices that were \nmade when trading the model that really \nmeans that they are very good for NLP \ntasks and not so good for these like big \nIR tasks where you need character to be \nclose to you know health concerns \nyeah so uh the The Epiphany before I \nthink this will make a really great \ntransition to the next uh one of your \npapers I really want to talk about but \nkind of the Epiphany I had when I was \nlistening to your explanation was I've \nbeen thinking a lot about these cross \nencoders that take the query and each \ncandidate document as input and they can \nkind of Reason across entity uh \nsimilarities and intend a little bit but \nso so kind of the Epiphany I'm having is \nit's about can we do some kind of \noffline computes because the cross \nencoder this is really slow to do this \nwith you know and that's the problem \nwith that but if we can do some kind of \noffline computation of entity linking I \nlove this knowledge graph embedding this \nidea where maybe we can sync the links \nacross the graph I think there is a lot \nof research to be done I don't like have \na really concrete sense of how that \nwould work but and then I think also \nkind of like \nadding entity mentions and kind of \npopulating symbolic filters because you \ncan symbolically filter really fast and \nall that so okay awesome so the next the \npaper I'm so excited to dive into is \ntitled perspectives on large language \nmodels for relevance judgment and um so \nquickly I'm going to \nI'm going to I'm gonna uh in the show \nnotes or in the podcast quickly I'm \ngoing to edit and show this picture \nof the collaboration perspective so the \npicture okay so I'm I'm so excited to \ndive into this I'm so interested in this \nidea of using large language models to \nuh you know generate queries for \ndocuments or label the relevance of \nqueries and documents um can you please \ntell me about like how you think about \nall this okay \nI think first of all \nfirst of all it was a rejected paper \nthat will just like tossed out an \narchive and tweeted about it and it's \nprobably like now my most sighted and \nlike I'm like okay \nopinion piece like how about my other \nwork okay well \num yeah I think \nmost people and I think there was like \nsome confusion initially where people \nare like looked at like we did some \nexperiments on um can you use like GPT \nlike completely replace human judgments \nand if you just do an ex empirical \nexperiment yeah like Coral is actually \nreally well you know \num not always especially there are a lot \nof like uh entries where and that's \nmaybe actually very interesting pocket \nwhere um the user said a human judge \nsaid it's not relevant but like a large \nlanguage would say it is relevant \nand I think those documents are either \nextremely \nbad or they're going to be extremely \ninteresting because they might pick up \non things that like the human assessor \nmight not be able to like identify just \nbecause they didn't know \num like here's my favorite example is I \nasked a bunch of these models like how \nis \num how is diabetes connected connected \nin the relevant way to child trafficking \nand that's some that's actually a \nquestion that we asked like some \nassessors in like um a track track that \nwe ran like a while back and most humans \nwould say uh probably not relevant so \nhere's what the large language models \ncame up with they say oh no it is \nsomewhat relevant \num because I'm actually I'm guessing it \nI'll let you I'll let you take a guess \nuh maybe it would be \na you'd have to take extra care \nyou see it's a negative I see okay so \nhere is what the larger English models \nlike said and I don't know whether it's \ntrue or not right but like I think it's \nlike interesting to consider \num that is you know \nchildren who suffer from diabetes rely \non their medication \nif you're trafficking children you need \nthem to do your bidding \nvery easy way to do that you will hold \nthe medication that like they depend on \nI mean this took a Doctrine very quickly \nyou know but \nit's like an example of like oh my God I \ndidn't see this coming yeah again \nGoosebumps with this you kind of like \nwith something like that like and I'm \nkind of and I think it requires like \nmore study and research to kind of like \nidentify well what is this pocket where \na large language model maybe like see a \nconnection but the human judge without \nlike any further knowledge and with \nlimited brain capacity \num it's kind of like not seeing it \nI think maybe I was like this is like \nnot the most important fact to mention \nabout like childhood trafficking \nalthough I think maybe it is you know \npeople should be warned \num but like it's certainly like \nsomething that's kind of like if I want \nto give more information about let's say \nchild trafficking it's something that \nlike deserves to be mentioned \num and I mean a lot of the stuff that \nI'm really excited about is like not \njust to give like a short answer but to \ngive like a longer answer right and this \nis like where I think those facts would \ngo in \num to come back to the original question \nabout the using GPT for relevance \njudgment \num I think \nthe the real title should have been \num why why you shouldn't use GPT for \nviolent judgments although it looks like \nyou could \nbecause there's like a lot of problems \nwith it like even even though it looks \nlike oh yeah it like lines up really \nwell with like humans \num there are a lot of problems with that \num like often we like to use judgments \nas being sort of like an independent \narbiter and as as unbiased as we can be \num so that when we develop a new method \nit's not already prone to prefer one \nmethod with the other like here's an \nexample like we all so excited about \nlike GPT different GPT models are from \ndifferent brands and so on \num if you choose to use one to do \nrelevant judgments and then that's the \none that like somebody is like using in \ntheir method \nvery likely their method might just look \nbetter than another method that's \nsimilar but use a different large \nlanguage models so you get like a real \nkind of bias that very likely one \nlanguage one just like it's have a \npropensity to like some model some work \nbetter than others \num just based on well this is like the \nsame thing you know it's um \nso that's kind of like one problem with \nthat um \nthere are other problems that could be \num okay but why do you bother using like \nthese last language models to create \nrelevant judgments if they are so good \nat identifying what's relevant why don't \nyou just like use those as a as a as a \nranker they lose you \nam I back \nI'm back sorry about that hey I was just \nlike so exciting like just on the high \npoint I get cut off oh no yeah \nnever forget my train of thought um \nokay why should you not use it well um \nyeah I mean like there's one thing about \nlike you know having uh propensities to \nlike one model then there's like another \none method versus the other so you \nprobably wouldn't be quite as like \nindependent now the problem of like \nhuman judges are also like not that \nindependent there's like all kinds of \nlike other biases like when it comes to \nlike humans \num another problem is well rather than \nusing large language modes to create \njudgments and then use a not so great \nsearch model to like to train it or I'd \nlike to assess it why not just use GPT \nas a ranking model if it like has \nlearned everything okay that's like one \nthought um and maybe if you're while \nwe're still staying with like the AI \ndriven models \num although I hope we assume coming \nwe're moving away from that but as long \nas you're staying with that it's not so \neasy to use as a ranker \num maybe you can use like to generate a \nfifth query and then run that against a \nsearch engine \num other people say well you still might \nwant to do it because maybe that's too \nslow so you can like train a faster \nmodel to do that \num so there's kind of like various kind \nof problems with that \num \nin the paper we go in like the spectrum \nof like we call it like a human machine \ncollaboration like it starts with like \nyou just use a human \nuh which like nobody in their right mind \nwould use they usually use a human with \nlike some very rudimentary support like \nhighlighting certain keyboards and so on \nand like you know Finding like stuff \nabout the same topic we try to group it \nso that the user can just say oh yeah \nthat's relevant oh yeah that's the same \nit's also relevant so transitive closure \nkind of problems right \num like on the far end you have \num fire the human just use a large \nlanguage model and it just talked about \nall kind of problems in that but I think \nwhat's really interesting is like the \nSpectrum in between and that was what \nthe paper really was intended to be \nabout even though most people just \nzeroed in like on this like far and that \nit was just meant to be like a \ntheoretical like let's see how well that \ncould even work right \nlike the spectrum between is like one \nwhere \nyou give the human like more and more \nmore support \num or you are used to human like to \nDefine what is relevant and you let the \nheavy lift even be done by some more \nautomated method but like it's the human \nwho defines this is relevant this is not \nrelevant okay \num and then you can go further into like \nthe machine side where yet maybe have \nlike the machines like generate some \nrationales like maybe you can ask hey \num explain to me why this is relevant \nexplain to me why this is not relevant \ntwo explanations now the human can read \nboth of them can say oh yeah I find this \nmore convincing right so being the human \nas an arbiter \num you talked about biases a lot like of \ncourse that like introduces a bias right \nlike I'll show you like what I said \nearlier with the diabetes and child \ntrafficking once you see that \ninformation you cannot unsee it \nand sometimes there's like interesting \ninformation which is not necessarily the \nmost relevant information so this is \nlike you really need like a special \ntraining for for your human assessors if \nyou want to do that kind of approach I \nwould say \num \nyeah what else \num I think something \nthat could be very interesting is like \nuse \num \nmaybe less for evaluation but actually \nas a method is to like use some of the \nauto generate like Auto regressive light \nlanguage models to actually generate \nlike some pieces of text or like \ngenerate some hypothesis like what I \njust said for the human like this is \nwhere this is not relevant maybe you're \nactually as part of like a search \ntechnology you get a query you get a \nbunch of things maybe entities and you \ncan ask for each of those hey is this \nrelevant this is not relevant give tell \nme why you take those rationales you \nfurther kind of like throw them into \nlike an in-memory index kind of like \nindex it on the Fly \nyou can solve like uh use some model to \ngenerate some hypothesis of like what \ncould be interesting facts while at the \nsame time then using search technology \nto either verify oh is this really \nrelevant or uh if that's like a weird \nclaim whether they come from they come \nfrom like some site that I like \nfundamentally disagree with \nuh or the user found that we disagree \nwith I should say then um maybe you want \nto kind of like dismiss this \num and I think that could be a much more \ninteresting constructive way to like \nreally work with like other regressive \nlanguage models um \num and with respect to evaluation I \nthink \num I hope that we will see like more \nwork in the like middle Spectrum like \nhumans with like more automatic \nassistance \nsome more automated ones with like more \nhuman assistance like somewhere like in \nbetween I think the Spectrum often has \nbeen like traditionally very like \nunderexplored um like one thing that we \ntried \num \nif you were surprised it worked it was \nlike really an out there and outlandish \nidea was to instead of like having \nqueries a collection and then asking \nhumans like is this relevant versus not \nwhich I'm not sure if you've ever tried \nthat it's a very annoying task to answer \nI can do it for three minutes then run \nout of patients I'm like very \ninconsistent with myself sometimes I'm \nlike oh yeah this one's good that sounds \nno it's not really not wearing oh like \nthat sounds familiar I think maybe it is \nrelevant I don't know no I have to go \nback and do all the judgments myself \nagain so it's like um quadratic grew up \nin assessments right \num like instead what we said hey \nespecially as a teacher hey just write \nan exam like here's a query \nwhat are the what are the important \nfacts that I need to mention \nfor in in stuff that's like relevant on \nthat topic it's a something about \ndaven's Voyage like you know in the in \nthe book that he wrote and some of the \nbig discoveries that he that he done \nlike about like genetics and so on right \nit's um like you can say here this is \nlike tell me about this and as a human I \nwould say well you're for that kind of \nparticular information you need I won't \nhave like this fact this fact this fact \nthis fact \nif I can write a multi-choice question \nfor each of those facts \nuh and like then assume that multiple \nchoice question answering is a solved \nproblem \nwhich I think hopefully most people \nwould agree then um you can just write \nexam questions as a human to Define \nwhat's relevant \nI can train a question answering system \nand then we can like ask different \nsystem hey retrieve relevant documents \nand we can check all of those documents \nfor how many of these facts can a \nquestion answering system answer \nthe more of these facts the questions in \nsystem gets right the more I believe \nthat you are a good search system \nso it's just like a very different way \nof thinking about it um the paper that \nwe wrote about I think it got rejected \ntwice because people are like this is \njust insane I was like yeah but look it \nworks like I don't believe your results \nokay like scientific methods yeah but \nlike um but like imagine this you can \nsort of like now \num use a human to Define what's relevant \nyou can use some other automatic system \nto like do the heavy lifting while still \nlike the human is still like in the boat \nand especially if you are if you're \nworried about like biasing the Human by \nshowing them information you can just \nsay no the human first needs to come up \nwith the task like do your own research \nlike come up with like tasks are really \nimportant \num and now you kind of like have less of \na bias if that's like what you're \nworried about by showing them \ninformation if you're worried about that \nthe human might be missing things and \nespecially interesting facts that like \nno human will probably think of in the \nfirst place you can then say okay now \nread through all the different search \nresults and then maybe think three more \nmaybe add a few more questions to it and \nbecause we have in the automatic \nquestion answering system or some other \nkind of like machine learning method \nthrough the heavy lifting you can \nactually run it again and again and \nagain and again and it will not like \nchange its mind on like this as well \nwhat this is like not relevant um I mean \nof course your new question answering \nsystem that answered the questions not \nfrom World Knowledge you're not allowed \nto memorize things you have to read it \nout of the text so this is like where \nyou know lots of like the \num reading comprehension work kind of \nlike now could really be like very \nuseful here like as an evaluation method \nyo um well that has so much information \nabout it I'm firstly surprised to hear \nthat it has been rejected because I \nthink this is such an impactful paper \nespecially from the perspective of \nvector databases and search relevancy \nstuff generally like this whole concept \nwe've seen works like in pairs and \npromptegator where you just generate \nqueries for the documents so then you \nknow like users of leviate can just \nupload their documents and then have \nqueries and now they have something to \nkind of ablate the models with so if you \nwant to say \nyou know does the openai model work \nbetter than the cohere model you as you \nmentioned like annotating the relevance \njudgments yourself is like maddening so \nhappening having the models to do it and \nthen you've identified this kind of \nspectrum of how you would collaborate \nwith the uh large language models for \nannotating these I think that's probably \na pretty promising startup category is \ncreating the music \nthese kind of things I haven't left \ngiving my ideas away for free like I'm \nnot I'm not in the market of startups I \nthink \ntoo but like um yeah and I think this is \nmaybe it's kind of like very \nyou know we're all kind of like very \ntechnical like technology oriented and \nmaybe this is like sort of like why \neverybody like gravitated to the right \nside of the extreme \num I'm more like in the in the middle \nand I think like the the paper is I mean \nlike it's not just my paper like it's \nlike um 12 really like well-known people \nlike in the field like thought and we \ndisagree with one another in our \ndiscussions and like if you look at the \nend of it they're like sort of like \nthree opinions initially we thought \nthere would be either you you yes you \nthink we should use more llms like in \nfor evaluation or you should not think \nand if you look at it as actually more \npeople came out on the side like no \nlet's not do this right now and like \nsome of those might be maybe uh not \nright now but some people even thought \nmaybe never \num because of various kinds of like \nissues that like come along with that so \nit's really like a paper like like and \nwants to caution people and not just \nlike saying this is what it is \num and I think this is also like where \nyou know identifying like should we use \nor should we should we not use it I \nthink also for the research Community \nwould be like very important to kind of \nlike \nhave a discussion and get some clarity \non like what do we as a community think \nshould be done but it should be not done \num because you know we try to write \npapers and like the thing I'm really \nworried about is where as a as a paper \nauthor you try to do everything right \nand now if you end up using automatic \njudgments or like some other half \nautomated judgments \nyou get rejected because like somebody \nsays no we should never use that \nand now if you don't do that then people \nwill reject your work because they say \nwell you haven't done that everybody \nshould be doing this right and I think \nthis is sort of like I call it like a \nreviewer standoff and I think that's \nkind of like \nnot healthy it's just like of like maybe \nwhere you know the people I'm sometimes \ntalk about the toxicity and research \nCommunity that's why it's like one thing \nbut I also think like by uh talking \nabout it and having a discussion and \nmaybe having a consensus maybe also like \nhaving a consensus forming discussion \nlet's put it this way \num it's really like important to do this \nlike right now you know the same thing \nthat you know currently have all the \nkind of teachers being like uh like uh \nlike ripping their hair out over or how \ndo we keep our students from like \nillegally using uh language models for \ntheir homework when we actually want to \nlike test what they're doing right this \nis like a big debate and like don't feel \nlike nowhere we should be like coming \nout \nand I think this is like another debate \nthat we need to be having uh we are \ncurrently like not having \num and I think it's uh it's something \nwhere \nwe need to kind of like develop like \nsome way way as a community like what \ncan we agree on or maybe we can at least \nagree on that like work that does either \nof those is still okay \nlike best practices and I think part of \nthis is like probably in in five years \nfrom now we will be like uh smarter in \nboth of those areas the educational part \nand the and the evaluation part \num but like right now it's a little bit \num \nwild west \nbut it's like uh dancing around trying \nto figure out where they where they \nstand now in 2023 I said it's a great \ntime to be alive \nyeah well you've given me such a new \nperspective of thinking about this I \nwould I started out so bullish on this \nidea that large language models should \njudge relevancy because I just see this \nproblem where like from maybe more of \nthe industry Stan uh perspective where \npeople come to aviate with like a \nknowledge base you know your slack or \nwhatever it is you just have documents \nreally you don't really have queries so \nthis notion of just generating queries \nto me I was just so certain that that \nwas going to be productive hold on can I \ncan I interrupt right here so he's like \ngenerating queries right and you know in \nthe yaya Community various people have \nlike tried to do that one as well like \nhere's a corpus let's generate queries \num I think that the idea of like what I \nsaid with that the human write an exam \nand let the exam like automatically then \ngreat things but the human is still in \ncontrol of whatsoever what's not \nrelevant \num I mean they're sort of like similar \nwork done in summarization because like \nin summarization you also have like a \nsimilar problem where you want to know \nis this a good summary this is a bad \nsummary right like and people actually \nhave also like worked on trying to \nautomatically \nderive questions from like a gold \nsummary that's like you know their their \nrelevant track is just a gold summary \nokay \num the problem that I see with that and \nalso like they see some of the metrics \nthat kind of like combine these things \nis it's from a text it's very easy to \ngenerate questions or queries which are \nnot that interesting all right I mean \nespecially if you use like a methods of \nyou take something you know this text is \nlike relevant or it's the right summary \nthen \num you kind of use triples and from \npurple like uh um you can say like \nBarack Obama married to Michelle Obama \nyou can now like turn that one around \ninto like a question or query like uh \nwho's married to Barack Obama and the \nanswer is Michelle Obama okay \nbut if this text is about like something \nvery different \nand it's relevant not because these two \nguys are like married to one another but \nabout something very critical that's \nlike in there now the question will like \nnot really get at the core of what's \nrelevant like this is where \num in my work we were like flipping \naround they said no you don't start with \na text and you generate a query or a \nquestion from it but you start with \nsomething somebody wants to know \nand now you do something that is I call \nit like a Humane a Humane use of human \nassessors like these exam questions and \nthen from there you can automate the \nprocess like I call this Humane because \nin some ways it's a lot more natural for \na human to like say what's relevant in \nthis case then in the other case like if \num I don't know if I may but like next \ntime you had a customer that comes to \nyou with like their slack chats and say \nwe want to retrieve over this one \nyou can maybe say \num maybe like what are like uh what are \ncritical priorities of like why you need \nthis search for right but like things \nlike give me a few examples of what you \nwant to know now give me in how can we \ncome up with like a test of what is like \nwhat are the things that you actually \nwant to know uh versus like some stuff \nthat gives you keyword matches right \nlike and I think you can like very it's \nvery easy to convince users that what \nthey say they want it's not what they \nwant by just throwing them a little \nprototype you say oh you want the \nkeyword matching here keyword matches do \nyou think that's relevant that's why no \nno no either say the first time you find \nyes okay so we need to like work on this \nto make all the stuff that you said no \nto go away and all the stuff so you said \nyes to like come up okay and now we can \nkind of like look at well why is this \nthing relevant \nand from there you can now do something \nelse you can preserve what is relevant \nand why this is relevant like maybe more \nlike a rationale \num homeless rationale you can now take \nwhat we what the what your customers \nsaid they wanted to know \nwhat was value and address is not \nrelevant and why is this relevant you \ncan now give that one to like a large \nlanguage model and from that one you can \nlet the large language model to say well \nif this is relevant then this this and \nthis is also relevant because it's \nrelevant in the same sense \nso it's a lot faster than having a human \nsay yes no yes no I mean it's also like \nevery mind I mean if you have to read \nthe same kind of facts over and over and \nover again it's just like one of the my \ncurrent problem was like search engine \nis like I'm asking for something get \nlike 10 documents that are pretty much \nlike identical in the information \ncontent so why do you show me at least \nlike other documents to show me \ndifferent documents right \num and that's like also like where by \nrelevant judgments also mind I mean \nbecause it's just like the repetition \nimagine you have to watch the same \nadvertising spot again and again and \nagain and again maybe you haven't made \nthat experience before okay so it's like \nyou just like become to like hate that \ninformation you're like please get me \nout of that hello please show me any \nother advertisement from the 70s so at \nleast I see something else \num and I think this is like where \ntrying to make the relevant assessment \ntask less mind-numbing by using like \nartificial intelligence in this like \nvery very particular way while still \nhaving the human being the driver's seat \nand saying this is this is not relevant \num I think that's really like where the \nfuture is and I think the future isn't \nthat far away like uh it's not like a \nnecessary I mean there could be also \nlike more I think I wish more academics \nwould be working on that but I think \nlike even from industry it's not that \nyou need somebody to like reinvent like \nand invent a new wheel for you right I \nmean this is just like it's just like a \nsimple idea it's like a concept \num that you can run with and as I said I \ngive my ideas away for free \nuh amazing I mean yeah I I I I love the \nnew ones that like just \nlike I love the perspective just to take \nanother nugget out of the paper just \nlike where you have the relevance not \nrelevant and you have two and then you \nhave like a higher level thing that \njudges it like I originally think was \nthinking of things like the Lang chain \nwhere you have like the chains of \nprompts and so it kind of generates \nsomething and then reflects on what it \ngenerated with the but yeah just \neverything you're saying there's so much \nNuance to doing the relevance labeling \nmaybe quickly if I could pick like I was \nI was thinking about like well yeah like \nwhen you generate a query maybe \nclustering these queries and embedding \nlike does this document also answer this \nquery \nI think that's actually something maybe \nlike just like a criticism I have and \nlike most IR benchmarks is that like we \nhave one query here one Curry here one \ncrew there we'd like have them like \nsample we usually try to sample from \nlike you know the whole space like \nanything anybody would want to know and \nvery rarely do we see like two queries \nabout like similar related topics right \num but and I wish we had like more of \nthose because I think if you are if \nyou're real at search engine company and \nyou're like have like query logs you \nprobably see that uh there's like things \nthat people like want to know about and \nit's gonna be like pretty much like the \nsame the same the same and sometimes \nthey're like different like nuances \nwhereas in good like different different \ndirections \num like we and we wrote a paper about \nlike a crew specific subtopics where \nwith the idea of like actually training \nyourself to like identify different \nTopics in search results not like with \nclustering team IDF clustering or like \ntopic models which where we actually \nhave some results that it does really \nlike not work it doesn't correlate with \nwhat's really relevant to us it's not \nbut like we actually trained to pick out \nreally these like very detailed fine \nnuanced topics and like one of my \nfavorite examples is to like just to \nconvince people that it's not just \ngeneral topics it's not just like here's \na set of document cluster them but it's \nabout uses of documents that we retrieve \nbut this is the information need that \nthe user really want to know about they \nactually can change the clustering is \nlike one about you know you have like \ntwo queries about like covid-19 one is \nsort of like about something where you \nwant to know like uh what was sort of \nlike big problems for like people \npersonal problems let's say maybe like \nthe loneliness or maybe like being uh \nlike uncertain about the future you know \nlike two big things \num but another one would be about like \ncovid-19 sort of like measures and like \num like treatments right so you can have \nimagine you would have like pretty \nsimilar documents that are relevant \nabout both queries \nbut the subtopics that make them \nrelevant they're actually very different \nand that that's kind of like why I call \nit fine-grained and it's like topics \nbecause you know it's like a a um you \nneed to identify what what the logical \nsubtopics once you have the subtopics I \nmean that also like falls together with \nwhat we just talked about with relevant \njudgments right like probably once you \nhave these subtopics if you put one \ndocument that says this is relevant then \nyou actually want to like look at the \nother documents right away and say oh \nthese are actually also all relevant or \nmaybe not if they're not relevant that's \na sign that maybe the subtopic detection \nkind of like wasn't quite correct and \nyou need to give you like more training \ndata into that right but again it's sort \nof like another way of like integrating \nhuman ancestors of like what's relevant \nor like what's topical and like which \ntopics are relevant versus Which \ndocuments are relevant \num and with like some elements of like \nmachine learning which like so far it \nwas like \num it was kind of like as it would be \nlike a taboo like you're not allowed to \nuse machine learning in in relevant \njudgments and I think it's like as you \nsaid like for for companies it's like \nit's just like not really \num financially feasible but also for \nacademics I don't think it's necessarily \nthe right idea because it's it gets like \nvery very expensive to do judgments for \nand then you have like a few queries and \nyou really don't have enough judgments \nto like train one of the heavy-duty \nneural networks anymore right like you \nneed a lot more training data and there \nneeds to be a compromise that we need to \nexplore and I think that's kind of \nsomething that will help like both \nindustry and academics to like move \nforward but again we need to also \novercome the taboo and like the academic \nworld \nhmm \nyeah just amazing uh so yeah that was \nsuch an incredible tour of these \nConcepts I feel so much so much \neducation from uh both the neurosymbolic \nunderstanding the knowledge graphs as \nwell as this concept of the large \nlanguage model relevance judgments and \njust wow there's so much depth to that \nand this conversation just really opened \nup my understanding of it and the \nacademic thing wow it's all just so \ninteresting so uh Professor Laura Dietz \nthank you so much for joining the \npodcast so knowledgeable you have such a \nlike an entertaining and energetic way \nof telling these stories and it's really \nawesome and so uh maybe before we uh \nwrap it up is there anything you'd like \nto maybe um tell people to look into \nI think \nyeah maybe one thing I think like at the \nmoment \nsomething that like I don't want to \nquite say annoy me but like give me a \nlittle of a pause is like how we talk \nabout technology and in particular \ntalking about it in like a \nlife or death situation like you find \nlike people will say like oh the AI \noverlords are coming and then we have \nthe other side says oh these are just \nstochastic parrots um like that's \nsomething we're afraid of and I think \nit's very difficult like I usually find \nmyself in the middle of all of this I'm \nlike you know \num I don't think it's just stochastic \nparrots but I also like don't think that \nthe air overloads already are here I \nmean like it's not I mean I understand \nthat a lot of people were like \nblindsided by the by the development but \nlike it's face it you know I mean like \nopen air has been working on GPT models \nfor like the last decade and I think if \nthey really really deserve something \nthen it's like kudos for just sticking \nwith it like every academic will \nprobably have given up a long time ago \nand you know they were like ridiculed \nfor like a bunch of like models like and \nthen I remember the last time with gpd3 \nit was like in the New York Times and \neverybody's like freaked out and then \npeople looked at it more more carefully \nit's like no you know this is actually \nlike not that great good yet I mean it's \nsomething to it but it's also like a a \nkind of like an element of \nuh saying you know this is like amazing \nand not just like trying to pick it \napart as in yeah this is like oh look \nlook here's like the all these different \nChronicles it gets like wrong I'm like \nwell how well is your method drawing on \nthis right like this summarization \nmethod like oh you're a co-generation \nmethod like how good is it and are you \neven like close to that one and like I \nhave to say for me probably not right \nbut it's also like you know there's also \nlike clearly like things that we like \nstill need to learn \num but then there's like so much \nopportunity that this technology like \ngives us without kind of like going into \nthis \num fear-mongering oh this is like all \nsuper terrible and like oh I have to \nlike leave the company now it's like not \nfurther not further this kind of like \nevil that they're about to like breed \nright there \num \num and I think that's kind of like one \nproblem I think on the flip side where \npeople are not afraid enough about this \nsort of like user tracking I'd like I \nthink um the number of times I had like \nconversations with my friends on \nFacebook on not filling in these like \nsocial engineering posts and then next \ntime they just do it again that's what I \nthink where the real danger is and I \nthink it's not gonna change unless we \nall kind of like do it a little bit \ndifferently \nyeah I mean I guess uh \nuh on the on the social engineering \nthing I guess kind of the concept of it \njust being very convincing so I guess \nlike there was a lot about the \nrecommendations and how that would put \npeople in kind of like a political \nuh what do you call it like uh when \nyou're TR like a rabbit hole where yeah \nwhere you're just seeing what you want \nto see and then there's just Echoes and \nyou never hear another \nyeah yeah sorry but yeah and I I think \num I'm curious what you think about like \nthe kind of in the in the what has \ninspired so much of the AI uh overlords \nare coming hype uh what do you think \nabout kind of like the auto gbtv the \nability of it to kind of decompose tasks \nand then use memory and I think it's \nsort of uh a pretty in it's a pretty \ncrazy jump it seems to me at least that \nlike now it can come up with an action \nplan and like execute this action plan \nand it's like connected to the Internet \nwith with the chat gbt Marketplace or \nlike the Lang chain tooling now I can \nwrite emails I can write so on the \ninternet it might as well be a person it \nseems \nsure but I mean it's like again like if \nyou look at if you look at GPT three \nfrom like you know like two years ago \nwhen was it \nI mean it had like you know this um this \nthing of like being able to like \ngenerate text so I was like I forgot \nlike her name she kind of like co-wrote \nuh was it a book or something \nuh about her grief with gpt3 my gpd3 \nwould just like put out like rationales \nmore or less and she would like then \nedit it and so on and I think this is \num you kind of and it's we're still \ndoing the same thing it's just like well \nthe quality got better \nbut this is also like you know we figure \nthings out and I mean sure you know like \nif you look at uh I'm not sure whether \nyou remember the first iPhone you know I \nwas like oh boy copy and paste right so \nI mean and look at the iPhones we have \ntoday or like other smartphones I want \nto name any Brands but like um it's like \nof course you know you kind of like \nslowly figure things out if you look at \nChain of Thought prompting for example \nright like I mean it's it's not that you \nhave it's not a new mathematical model \nit's just like a different way of using \nit and we know that from uh gpt2 which \nis you know like very old right we know \nthat that actually was working really \nwell in this like few shot setting \nright which counts like now I mean \nthat's like what Chain of Thought \nprompting like falls into and like we \nknew that well maybe gpd2 like out of \nthe box with like direct answer it \nwasn't the best but really like at the \ntime people said you know what actually \nthis is actually not bad technology if \nyou use it as a future prompting and I \nthink the instruction based method is \njust sort of like a logical follow-up of \nit like oh let's maybe prompt it with \nsome shots and not just like clear the \nsession and throw it away but like maybe \nlike preserve this right like I think \nit's sort of like a over time it's like \nuh it's not that um there was like this \none big thing that just that suddenly \nappeared overnight no it's like it's \nlike steady amount of work over a decade \nby by a bunch of people and then there \nwere like some people had some new ideas \nlike oh look I found this thing or like \nme saying oh here was the thing we \ndidn't think will work oh my God it \nactually worked actually pretty well and \nlike what does this open up and the next \nperson like learns from it and say oh \nnow we add this one here and this one \nhere \num \nI think this is like where uh um \nwhenever we give our touring Awards we \nalways like pretend that there's like \nthis one or few people who kind of like \ndid it all by themselves but like in \nprice it's like never the case right \num and I think this is also like why \nthis development was \num like kind of like observable right \nlike I think maybe if people like \nstopped looking after they played around \nplayed around with like gpd3 once or \ntwice and then said like yeah okay like \nthis is like neat but like it's not yet \nready uh you just like don't keep an eye \non the development and then you get \nsurprised \nbut \num I wouldn't say that this is like \nsomething where overnight our machines \nbecame intelligent I think over the last \ndecade Bit by Bit by Bit of machines all \nmachines became more intelligent and \nmore helpful to us \nwell I have one more on I have to give \nyou a take on this with the for the sake \nof ref perspective for those listening \nthe last podcast we did or I don't know \nwhat the order but the podcast with Bob \non generative feedback loops the entire \ntranscript is 13 000 tokens I imagine \nthis podcast of Professor Dietz is \nprobably about 20 000 tokens am I \ntalking too fast \nso the whole transcript of everything \nwe've said in this hour and a half is \nprobably 20 000-ish tokens so these new \nmodels like gbt4 with 32 000 token \ninputs or the Mosaic ml MPT that do 65 \n000 token inputs I mean what what can we \nexpect with that \nI think you know and that's like a very \nold machine learning Mantra like the \nmore training data the better \num short of \nuh well the training day should be \ncorrelating with the task that you \nwanted to be good for right like um \ngarbage in garbage out of course also \nholds here \num \nI think part of this I mean I don't know \nI I don't I don't talk to I mean I don't \nknow the details about any of the \ncommercial available models but like my \nhunch is that they probably now have \nconsumed the whole internet and and some \nmore \num and like this is where we are right \nnow and there are still problems so I \nthink next thing we need to do is to be \na little bit smarter in spending our \ntraining data wisely \num then I hear things like uh several \ntrillion \nparameters and like the machine learning \nis like \nuh do you have the training data to \nserve up on these \ndegrees of freedom right like and \num and like the third part of me thinks \nis like you know like all the like all \nthe regressive language models I think \nyou know it blows my mind how well that \nworks I \ndid if you had asked me like a decade \nago whether this is like the right way \nof doing everything I would probably say \nno probably not okay so kudos to them \num but I also think that it's probably \nthe right architecture like if you look \nat the architecture underneath it and \nhow it learns it's the right \narchitecture for anything that's all \nlike generative \nbut not everything in the world is \ngenerative I think at the moment people \npretend that it is \num and like maybe you can turn a lot of \nthings into generative but like \nthere are other problems that are not \nnecessary about like all the regressing \nwords word by word \num like as I said initially with \nretrieval metric learning right like \nbring the things that close together \nthat are that are relevant bring them \nfar apart if they're like not relevant \nbring things close together when they're \nabout the same subtopics bring them far \napart further apart when they are like \nabout different sub topics right you can \nwrite build up a space \num this is not necessarily how other \nregressive language models work right \nthe question now that I have and that's \nhonestly a research question is \ncan we do with fewer parameters by \nhaving maybe a let's say medium smart \nlanguage model not one that like \nmemorizes all the facts but maybe one \nthat maybe can like Leverage search \nengines more effectively and if you see \nthis with you know retrieves augmented \ngeneration and so on right \num \nbut like can we maybe also do that with \nknowledge graphs and so on and we see \nthat like with the the tool Integrations \nthat we now have like in open ai's \nproduct tool right \ncan we maybe \ndo away with some of the latent \nparameters that are currently being used \nin kind of like \njust like teaching like using language \nas a means of like expressing things \nexpressing search requests \ninterpreting what the user wanted to \nknow interpreting what we see and \nbringing that one together rather than \njust \nlike sort of like a like a student in \nclass like I know the answer I know the \nanswer but like can we maybe \num trained like a machine the way that \nmaybe we humans would like uh or saying \nhumans would do that I mean the humans \nthat memorize phone books I'm not one of \nthem so I need I need to look up the \nthings again and again and again again \nbecause it will not stick in my brain so \nis there something is that maybe like a \ndifferent it's a very different approach \num and like given that it took uh open \nAI like a decade plus like get to that \nparticular to really fine tune all the \narchitecture here I don't know maybe \nwe'll take another \nfive six years like to rock on \ncompletely alternative approaches and \nthen we will have to see \num which one actually ends up getting us \nfurther to \nmaximum usefulness let's call it this \nway right so it's sort of like they're \nlike other architectures that kind of \nlike might maybe be worth while \nexploring but then uh again we end up \nwith the researcher standoff where \npeople say unless you compare to this \nthing which is like overly tuned and \nlike forced and Polished we don't want \nto hear about you we don't want to hear \nabout your ideas I was like well this is \nlike this way we're just gonna be like \nstuck in our little research Optimum and \nall computer science professors will \nform this point forward be condemned to \nonly ever do prompt engineering which I \nthink would be probably better be done \nin the humanities department but like \nokay but like I think this is like where \nthe news is still out on like whether \nthat is the only architecture that you \never need or whether they're like other \narchitectures that might be better \nbetter as in like requiring like less \nthree less fewer degrees of freedom uh \nrequiring like less training data using \nthe training day like more effectively \nand doing something that are kind of \nlike they're just like the architecture \nis better matched like other tasks \nbecause I think not everything is like \nother regressive generation \nbut it could also be wrong you don't \nknow uh we should meet again in like a \ndecade and then I can say when I was \nwrong \nyeah that sounds great uh yeah amazing \nso Professor Deeds thank you so much for \nyour time this is such an awesome \npodcast and thank you everyone for \nlistening thank you Connor \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Neurosymbolic AI in
