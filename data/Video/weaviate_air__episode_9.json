{"text": "Multi-tenancy: https://weaviate.io/blog/multi-tenancy-vector-search Berlin Hackathon cool video: ... \nforeign [Music] this is going to be a record-breaking episode we have Hall 8 beautiful people with us here this is so much exciting you can see Edward is super excited and this is going to be super great and this is going to be the final single digit episode this is a very important information because the next one will be a double digital one um so with us we have like a really great crew some new faces so you can see for example hokun nesrin and Ricardo uh who are our special guests who are participated in a really cool hackathon that we organize in Berlin so they'll be demoing some projects and you know the usual suspects you have done in JP who talk to us about cool stuff and attend our CTO was like a cool announcement so thank you for spending your time and for watching uh Vivid air like we're always excited to see you and uh to have you you know be part of this shop um so thank you for watching and listening and you know if you want to help us a little bit give us a like that always helps because then the video will pop up in more places and that always helps it's always nice um but most importantly because you are with us live what you can do that you can't do when you watch it later is you could ask questions right so feel free to ask questions so as you ask questions I will be sharing them with our audience here so whoever is talking about given topic I can always ask these questions to them um you know like keep it civil of course right like I'm not going to ask two bad questions although like uh the same goes like there are no bad questions just stupid answers um so that's it and um yeah super excited to have you here so what are we going to talk about today is first we open up with a multi-tenant update so uh next week Thursday we're actually planning the next release for vv8 that which was going to be within 120 and the multi-tenancy is a huge feature for us uh so at the end it will talk about it um I already mentioned the mlops hackathon that we did in Berlin so I would like to talk a little bit about it but more importantly I would like to share you know we would like to share with you the the winning three projects uh so that's why we have our special guests here um then later on Edward um our new arrival wait Edward I didn't introduce you right damn I'm so terrible yes Edward welcome Wentworth he's a he's a new rifle oh my God I'm so embarrassed um maybe that's because you're a cat person I'm a dog person you know like you know that was on purpose uh but yeah Edward actually built a pretty cool demo and he really wants to share with us um and uh it's actually really really interesting way of using widget as well so uh we're happy to have you here uh even if I miss you to begin with um then we want to talk to you about this new thing we introduced which is like the Vivid Forum leaderboard so for those of you that are you know good contributors uh you definitely can see your name higher up and uh there's some rumors that I may be buying bottles of nice things to people that uh you know are tough contributors at the very least you know like if you stay serious I'll send you like one of those amazing wavy t-shirts or maybe some other swag um JP would talk to us about the Vivid Academy which is uh pretty cool and uh who knows maybe you know if anyone likes meerkats maybe somebody can help me name my wooden meerkat because this is vasili he already he has a name vasili or Vasco um but the wooden guy doesn't have a name yet so maybe we have time out yet so uh also drop us in comments uh say hi like say hi where you watch from or just ask questions and I'm super pumped uh to have you here and we already have the first comments uh from like some other Usual Suspects of Conor packed house of course go team go yeah thanks Erica so without any further Ado I'd like to basically pass on the microphone to atien uh and tell us what is this all multi-tenancy about like why are we so excited uh because like even like when we talked about it at first I was like all right so what do we even mean by multi tendency like why do we want that so at the end the floor is yours yeah so thanks for for having me especially in this packed episode I'll try to keep it short and and also hi to Connor and Erica who just popped up like usually it's the other way around they they would say hi to me on the episode so that's nice um yay okay hi um so multi-tenancy and see one of those sort of very special moments in VBA history I think we we had a couple feature-wise where where um we would introduce something new that somehow changes how you interact with vb8 or at least gives you the ability to to do new things with vv8 that you couldn't do before and multi-tenancy is is one of them so first of all what what do we mean by multi-tenancy like multi-tenancy in general is the the idea of sharing some kind of resources for multiple tenants so the name is basically likely would have maybe an apartment building and then multiple people would rent an apartment in that apartment building they would be tenants from the perspective of the of the building owner and if you rent an apartment you have some strict isolation requirements you don't want to sort of share your apartment with your neighbor unless you maybe invite them over or something but in general you you like that you can lock your door and you have this kind of isolation uh requirement nevertheless some things in there are shared so for example the heating system in the building might be shared and and um this is kind of what this is about like making sure that um individual tenants have their own sort of their own space can do with their deal with their own things but at the same time they still live in the same building and this is exactly the same kind of concept for VBA so for a multi-tenancy case you would have a single vv8 cluster so it's not single in a single instance but a single cluster sort of a single deployment for example if you sign up to the WCS that would be sort of your your bb8 instance and then you can host multiple tenants on there and a tenant could be so so for example if your app has let's say you have an app for note taking and um your your users basically would be your attendance and it makes sense that that unless serve users actively share their documents if they search through their documents they want to share when it searches with their own documents or the documents off their own organization but not like if we as a business the note taking app would have three competing businesses like you definitely don't want those competitors to be able to search through each each other's documents so that's kind of the idea around multi-tenancy and this this concept of course is nothing new like for a SAS business it's completely normal to have multiple different users and have these kind of isolation requirements but the way that we could do this in vb8 is completely new because before it's and now we can say that because now we have the proper solution before it was basically just work rounds you could use this for example using classes because a class already is an isolation unit in vb8 so you could just have one class per tenant and this is this is the the approach that we recommended up until now works okay gives you the best sort of of um yeah the best isolation requirements and everything but maybe two to five thousand tenants is the most that you could run on a on a cluster and also just adding more notes to the cluster didn't really help there because there were sort of these Central constraints because in the end it was just the workaround but now with the native multi-tenancy feature uh we can actually support millions of tenants and every single one of those tenants could on their own have millions of objects so so basically it's easy to go into the the billion or trillion scale of objects and still keep these kind of isolation requirements and something that's extremely important and extremely cool about this in in my opinion is the fact that you're sort of never locked in like you can dynamically grow your VBA cluster by simply adding notes or if you're on the on the VBA cloud service then you won't even know that then basically our system in the background will just add more notes you you won't even um won't even notice so um in our initial load test that we did I think we were able to to run 50 000 tenants on a single note in the exact number that varies depending on how how um how much data you have per tenant um how many fields how this is structured et cetera there are basically a couple of hard limits that that on something that a single machine can host which is sort of the whole idea of cloud and distributed setups and sort of horizontal scaling and um yeah with with 50 000 so you could keep this on a single node as you grow your business and onboard more users and then at some point if it's too much you just add a single a second node and then you have more capacity for another 50 000 and so on and this basically scales linearly and that's that's extremely important because that means sort of the whole vv8 mindset already like if you look at our pricing model for example that is already a pay as you grow kind of model and now we also have the architecture that that works for that as well so basically infinite scaling infinite linear scaling with multi-tenancy um from a user's perspective super easy to use it's basically just one New Field that is added that's basically just the name of the tenant which you would probably have had before in in one way or another anyway you would have maybe had a field in your schema and then maybe set a filter or you would have had a part of your class name so super easy to use everything will stay the same the only difference basically is that and multi-tenancy is opt-in so if you don't have multi-tenancy case you don't have to use it but if you do then you should specify the tenant key and um yeah basically use VBS as the the rest says the same so it'll be super easy to to use as well and um yeah it will scale very well with the number of tenants it will also the the kind of isolation this is something where a technical requirement and a business requirement or a functional requirement uh come together so for example something that we hear very very often especially in in Europe or in Japan that also came up more but it's also more in in the US um it's um so the Europe European in one is a gdpr but other kind of isolation requirements as well where deletion plays a big role so for example off-boarding of of tenants and this is something that that you typically don't think about in your business cases because you think about sort of onboarding new users and you don't want to think about losing them but one sort of technical case that we see very often is for example if you have a free trial um if you have a free trial that would expire let's say after two weeks or so now if you have a marketing event or something else happen or your app goes viral on social media and you suddenly get a massive spike in signups that's awesome so that's that's one thing that multi-tenancy can handle just add more notes if you if you um if you can't sort of handle it with the existing infrastructure but now out of those maybe tens of thousands of users that all signed up on the same day that also means their trial will all end up the same day and well we of course wish you that every single one of your free users converts into a paying user we know that that's not the case so within like insanely High conversion rate of 10 that would still mean that 90 of users are off-boarded and this this sounds trivial this sounds like okay then let's just delete 90 but from a technical perspective it's extremely important to make sure that those 90 of users dropping off don't have a negative impact on your paying and and staying users and this is something where if you if you don't have this kind of technical level isolation that can easily happen because in modern system deletes are often just done using flags and then something else happens in the background and you have these async processes to clean it up and that's actually very similar with Vector search as well so being sure that you can essentially say removing a tenant is as simple as deleting a file from disk and then it's gone that is super helpful from a technical perspective but also for these kind of compliance things like gdpr where you maybe have to prove that if a user says I want all my personal data gone then you can prove that you can do this in a certain time frame and that's that's sort of um yeah to wrap up where it started it is one of those big features where so many things are coming together and we can see this community demand so so shout out to um to yurai who was here on the on the deviate air uh maybe he's watching if so hi um who's here a couple of episodes ago um who had I think probably the first multi-tenancy case that that we were aware of um it come it came up very often in our community slack and now the forums there's like Hey how do I separate my workloads for multi-tenancy so it's a clear sort of Community Driven one it's of course also V8 as a business review it needs to make money so viviate also has commercial users this is something that there comes up more and more and it combines or if it makes sense from a technical perspective and it allows for these compliant things so this is basically what I meant like something where everything comes together I'm super proud of the solution that our team has built because it's something that that scales very well that makes sense that is very sound and so it's very future proof for multi-tenancy let's say nice um so just to wrap up as well like um what was like the main use case like is this my idea of it was always like hey what if I build a business and then like I need to like have a separate collection per customer or something is that the idea why we need multi-tenancy or are there other use cases that that is the the primary one like from the the technical infrastructure you could use that for different things as well you could use it for example for say in a Time series um when you say like you have data uh that lives for or you you add data every week and you have a retention period of 52 weeks you could basically treat that as a multi-tenancy case you could say one week as a tenant you have 52 tenants and once you grow build it Beyond uh 52 you just delete the oldest tenant so that also allows for these kind of things but that they're more sort of that those are not the primary use case the primary use cases are really as a business you have multiple users and those users can upload documents or whatever they have to deviate and it needs to be isolated to them like you need to make sure that user a never sees the documents of user B and also it needs to make sure that for example if user a has a lot of traffic and they're hosted on the same machine that user B still has dedicated resources or still has has um sort of we can still keep their throughput up so that you have don't have this kind of interference even though they're on the same same setup and of course also cost savings like you could of course also say that for multi-tenancy what I could just deploy maybe one BBA cluster per tenant but just think of million tenants then then you're bound to have some kind of overhead and if you pull these things and still get the the isolation requirements then or the isolation capabilities then it's way easier to to save on your infrastructure bill which you don't have to care about if you use the vb8 cloud service but of course you can also self-host it and then then you do nice nice um you have two messages from the community first of all gift uh it says good to be here it's a gift to have you here a gift um intended sorry I couldn't help myself and uh Jurgen is saying yeah deleting specific content is very helpful not just per tenant though good to hear about this feature so very nice thank you um Also if anyone has any questions and now is the time because I know Etienne is very busy and you have to disappear soon so yeah any questions here if someone wants to uh find out more about this feature is there a place they could go to perhaps to get more information there is we've released a blog post um about a week ago and of course there will be much more once the final release is out but for now basically the the teaser with a couple of more example use cases uh with with the kind of technical features like what makes the feature great from a technical perspective that's all in there so um yeah I think Sebastian will put the link in the description that sounds so YouTubey the link in the description can I also ask for people to smash the like button and subscribe please yeah of course we should do it um so the link I'm sharing here on the screen but there's also in the description of the video uh you can find all sort of links in there and this being one of them yeah so this was not a planted question not at all actually we didn't rehearse that so that's fine perfect exactly perfect I see a couple of uh more uh responses so I see gift I appreciate my my joke that's very nice thank you and uh Erica already smashed it very nice with capital letter so um I was like I should shout but I don't want to do that very nice um yeah this is awesome this is super exciting uh so my this understanding is that this is going to be ready with innovate from Thursday next week and in WCS do we know when this is going to allow London WCS same same day same day perfect same day yes you'll be able to use it right away and um if you have an existing uh um sort of running machine on on the WCS you can just upgrade it using the automated upgrade feature if you start a new one it will always start with the latest version so you already have it and then you can add your multi-tenancy classes by the way also in combination with non-multi tenancy classes so that's and it also supports cross references so there's there's lots of lots of sort of things that we have to think about but they they will all work and if not then let us know then it will make them work nice this is this is exciting uh really cool and um also you can learn more about it in the blog post that we shared a link for but also if you're interested in the 120 release uh JP and Dan here they're actually working on the release blog post so that's also going to go live on Thursday so definitely check out our blogs page um let me see if I can show a quick Banner for it so if you're new to vv8 this is where all our blogs are come on show it so uh definitely check it out on Thursday next week but you should be checking it every week anyway because we always have cool awesome content um perfect I don't see any more questions for at the end uh at the end thanks for uh for joining us for the session and uh for a great explanation awesome thanks for having me congrats on on episode nine on the ninth birthday yeah the final single digit episode the final single digit episode I feel very honored to be part of this this final single digit episode yeah thank you says hi I'm not kicking you out all right on that on that note the next topic we have is the mlops hackathon that we did last uh last week yeah that was last week um in Berlin well depending how you measure time so basically this is this is a pretty exciting things because the first of all there's this amazing Community called like the like the mlops community uh and um I was talking to Demetrius who's like one of the founders of that Community uh and we're like hey how about we do some you know events and hackathons together and he basically said that Berlin is a is an excellent place to start because there's like some amazing engineers in there there's a really cool Vibe and who doesn't want to go to Berlin anyway right um so we kind of spend some time preparing it and long story short we ended up with like um like a two-day sort of uh event where first day was kind of like hey let's meet and greet on Friday if everybody gets to know each other you know get some pizza and stuff we're supposed to have barbecue uh but it was raining like hell so we ended up you know getting some takeout like a delivered Etc which is still cool like everybody you know had fun uh but then on Saturday we had if I remember correctly about 60 people that were divided in I think 19 or 20 teams uh hacking on various different projects and then by the end of the day we had 19 submissions all built with vv8 um like open air cohere and a bunch of other things really cool ideas of those 1916 were actually working demos which was pretty awesome uh there was few demos that didn't but you know that's part of the game uh and then eventually we had like three winners uh three winning teams so that's why we have here uh Nazarene Hawken and Ricardo and what I'd like to do is actually give them an opportunity to share their projects like so maybe a quick intro of who they are what they build and then maybe demo what they did so we will start with nasrin uh Hey nasrin welcome hey thanks for having me of course so you have project in it right what can you tell us about it yeah so um this project I did a coding assistant which creates code based on user prompt and based on user-divid libraries because I would data scientist and every diet every day at my data science job I feel like I'm confronted to the new library that I need to use so I thought about creating this Gooding agent which uh takes a library from from a user and then creates code based on that library and also this is because current alarms like chat gbt and gpt4 and so on have been trained on a pretty old Corpus and as we know libraries appear almost on a monthly basis and these LMS can't catch up so the idea was to provide these alarms with fresh documentation and to generate code code based on that cool cool so uh should we share your screen and then you could run a quick demo for us yes That'll be amazing so here's your screen so walk us through uh through a demo okay so let's explore the user interface so basically what we have here in the middle is the uh the prom The Prompt so the coding task that's going to be given by the user and uh here we have the libraries that are going to be used to generate the code so in this project I have provided the VBA library and the language chain Library and especially because link chain is quite a new library and you cannot find any uh support on that with uh current llm models so you basically enter your coding prompt here and then click on generate and what's going to happen is that on the left side you're going to see the uh the plan for the code which is going to then be transformed into code that you're going to see on the right and this code is going to be executed and the error logs are going to be shown in this console in the in the bottom so for example here I have this coding prompt using the link chain Library I write code for an agent that gives weather information based on a user-diven city and what I have here in the coding plan is in the first line I always have the uh the dependencies that I'm going to need for the project and I'm going to later talk why why this is necessary and then there's a generated plan for this coding task so in the beginning defining uh the the weather info function using the link chain library to create this agent using the agent to generate the query for the weather API and sending the uh request to the weather API and so on so it seems like a very reasonable workflow and we're going to see the um the result of the coding agent here so it's going to import some libraries and it has this this code which was generated based on the plan and how this actually works is shown here um so what happens is that the um the documentation for the libraries are downloaded as HTML and these documents are parsed and chunked and embedded into uh in the Revelator database and when the uh when we get a coding prompt from the user this prompt is also embedded and then we do a semantic search and we retrieve the most relevant documents from the vv8 vector database and we give this to the planning agent so basically in this project there are four agents which uh each each one of them is going to take care of a certain tasks so the planning agent is going to generate the code plan which is going to be given to a dependency agent and as we have seen in the plan if the first line is always the um the the libraries that need to be installed so the dependency agent is going to extract these libraries and these are going to be then installed into a virtual environment then this code generate the coding plan from the planning agent together with the context which is the relevant documents which we have retrieved are going to be given to a coding agent which is going to generate the code and this code is going to be run into this virtual environment where we have already installed the dependencies and this code is usually going to contain some mistakes so we will get these errors and we'll give all of these information the context on the source code and give all that to a code correcting agent which is going to keep track of all of these errors and with each iteration is going to correct the code and uh get the errors and so on and so a certain limit that is defined by the user of coding attempts is reached and we can see how this goes in action so I can give here a prompt like if you want to use the vv8 library I write code that I mean about documents and uh queries and save them thank you very late by queries um based on the user accounts or maybe let's see we've all been waiting for the live demo this is exciting yes uh so it it takes a little bit of time because it's going to generate a plan and then it's going to install the libraries and then it's going to run the code but actually if if you're lucky enough we can see how it is generating different versions of the code and so what we have here is on the left the uh the plan and we can see here it imported the Vivid client with this Dash and the error is that this is an incorrect syntax so hopefully in the next iteration is going to correct that um issue this is epic he's actually trying to figure things out step by step um just to add some encouragement looks like Conor is very excited like a huge congratulations this is the best example I've seen so far of this idea um and uh if if you don't know Connor Connor sees and knows everything that's going on in the ml space so if he believes this is the best example I think this is this is a good uh message to hear um thanks Amit uh we all think this is pretty awesome as well yes so one of the next steps for this so the problem is that this is even though it's giving given documentation it's usually like hallucinates some of the module Imports and some of the function um function parameters and so on so I'm currently creating so I I want to create a good base that is uh extracted a code-based knowledge graph that is extracted from the library and that's going to be also given to the to the agent so that they can verify if the module Imports and the functional parameters and so on are all correct based on the not only on the documentation but also on the uh on the code base from the library nice this is cool and I have a question because we have like uh at Vivi we've created this repository of recipes um like unfortunately Erica is not on the call but we have this like there's a bunch of Jupiter notebooks is that something maybe that you could ingest as like hey here's a loads of examples on how to do stuff with vgate yes I think all of these sources of information are very valuable for for the yeah that's a that's a great idea and I've seen also some research that also take information from stack Overflow and all examples so so for for the learning um for for learning from a learning perspective I think that's very viable nice yeah because I guess the idea is like the more good examples we can provide um to the machine right to figure out the code the better and uh we can already see Erica excited about this idea right like uh and any place that we could use recipes right Erica yeah so uh no that would be exciting I'll definitely I will definitely share with you the links to the recipes if you want to have like another iteration it would be kind of cool to figure out how to do it perfect yeah JP yeah you're here you could also say it so I didn't want to interrupt but but those recipes are really really cool and I think uh people at the hackathon um really appreciated having them to as a starting point and building on them obviously as well that's awesome cool cool I have one question from Connor so I'm gonna move you higher so that you're visible I'm not that important so retrain from stack of overflow particularly for that code correct correcting agent party super interesting curious how you are thinking about the wibit schema design for this um so not sure if you're an expert when it comes to the Vivid schema I would say um and that could be still a tricky topic I have started doing the code base now is a knowledge graph from a whole code base where you can link the folder structure and the modules and the classes the functions and the parameters and so on and um then then these should be checked uh or the agent should be able to query those to verify the the module in person all that kind of stuff but also how to uh how to include these examples from stack Overflow and everything what I've seen is that people use that information as description which they store for uh for these different parameters and modules and stuff like that so that provides further information for um for the other one I see that's interesting interesting yeah definitely a cool project to explore deeper right and uh go go deeper into it yeah cool this is uh this was a pretty cool demo like I'm super excited to see it uh running live and like the code plan was updating I saw that the code itself got updated as it went and this this is super cool like we could do a whole episode probably on each of the demos that we want to show today um but yeah thanks for uh for this demo um this is super cool thanks for having me it was such a great hackathon I must say yeah well uh next next academ we do like we'll definitely be using one of your like your project and the other projects as examples of like what to Aspire to so yeah thanks for setting the bar pretty high cool so next up the bar is pretty high hokun uh you're the next one to talk to us about the project bgb for all yeah so let me want me to share the screen but what's the project about what was the idea well yeah maybe it's better that I share screen to to like introduce this idea yeah all right so yeah and hulkman I'm from Tio Berlin as a research associate I work here and our team basically incorporates three foreigners who are no Germans and one German so the problem we want to serve basically is how we can use large Bank mode and also work the vector database vva to solve problems which might be encountered by foreigners in daily life and this one comes into our site bgb well probably you have no idea about this one it's basically the civil code for German for Germany and it has 336 pages and couple things about like uh the contract issues from your sign contract how should you end the contract or whether your contracts illegal or not uh in order to understand this law you probably need to read all the page which is 300 and maybe you are lucky that you cannot stand and solve your problem but it might be hard especially for foreigners we like me have no much knowledge about German and because of the larger language model like child gbt is very uh powerful at onstanding um this contacts however um to actually retrieve this knowledge this alloy is not that easy therefore we use vv8 to help us ingest those uh this law by basically chunk this book into several uh small uh parts and then when we ask a question about specific things like uh our rent contract then um the our assistant will retrieve the corresponding chapter from the bgb and then summarize with the source to the user so they can without reading the book and understand the law and how they should react so too much talk let's see how it works hey how can you doing great by the way like honestly to me even if you have a book that is written in your native language like uh already that is a difficult hurdle to go and find the information like it's it's impossible and then yeah I agree like if it's a foreign language that that's even worse like uh and me being polished living in Denmark right now I feel the pain you know I know what you're talking about yeah thank you I can't I think many people can relate especially my colleague today when he see uh so I basically tell about this uh podcast today and tell him the idea and he specifically point out that I should emphasize that there are already 20 of people in Germany are foreigners and probably most of them don't have the native speaking ability of German so yeah I think that's a big demand I think so yeah and and I also know that German is quite bureaucratic right so there's like not many ways around it like you really need to know this uh these rules and everything and being able to find the information is just tough so uh let's let's see what we can do because I've seen the demo live and I remember I was super excited but uh yeah yeah let's see if it works this time okay my apartment without noticing interesting yeah for example I'm quite curious about this question like which might be haunted in our daily life and what is uh our assistant we do basically is to retrieve the corresponding paragraph from phb law this book and then uh Supply that to gbt for API and then summarize with the information from the apgp and then with also the source um so maybe we can just take a look inside to underhood we retrieve the law with the the German translated but actually I think a good feature from Vivid is that it has close language in bending which makes it possible even here we just uh query with other language we can also get the uh the relevant information we want okay we now gather with that let's see so this is impossible and we can get exact the paragraph in the bgb law why it's not about and I think this is better than maybe just try and search online because yeah definitely people have information about this but probably they don't have exact paragraph to a site to use um to support and as I just mentioned maybe we can you know sometimes people are no good at English we can also try using other language uh I'm from China by the way so I will just use Chinese to ask uh if it's possible well let me just paste it so here it means same thing as here that I want to ask if it's love well okay cool since it doesn't work this time but you know we have a backup so I asked the same question here and we also get the like the similar answer uh and the theme is that it met with with uh English or Chinese we can always get the answer we want uh but probably for a user-friendly concern we can also like change the language here to to um like user language and on the left side I haven't introduced Adam this is a cool feature uh developer and designed by Max one team member of us that we uh specifically extract the quotes and also apply this translation here and specifically this quote is cross verified from it to make sure this is no hallucination for uh GPT for models and we we retrieve it directly from the vb8 and yeah you wouldn't you wouldn't want like an advice from a hallucination right like hey can my land records like hey if he needs to make the money bye yeah exactly yeah that's that's why we want to also have this whole features and in the future we would like yeah please go ahead so so one thing that that I remember during the demo you did like you also wrote the question in Italian and you got any response in Italian is that something you can still do uh well yeah definitely but not this time okay cool um I think uh I also tried to deliver this feature as well but like I think some prompts need to be like optimized to have such stability yeah I think that's yeah that's also what you want to achieve to adapt the answer to use the language that would be awesome nice and and I interrupted you when you said that you had like some ideas for the future yeah exactly so in the future we would like to open source our project and also provide it for public use maybe also I think it would be very useful that we include other big law other um regulations or things into the database review it so that like following us in Germany they can really answer their daily questions maybe also update their own like contracts to see uh if there are some like questions can be answered also yeah that's like a cool idea if you open sourcing one day we could also work together on like a create like a tutorial or something it could be a cool collaboration I would love that yeah yeah absolutely and uh to some encouragement so you can really like your idea uh you know uh chatting with law content a dream come true for many have your personal lawyer on your phone and ditch the real one is laying dead on the bottom of the sea a good start nice um some of yeah Edward appreciate the joke so that's Mark so yeah cool cool there's a question for you so how did you split the book would you use sentences this is really a good question I we actually in terms of issues when we just read the book uh at the beginning I think we still just by the the new alliance mark and it didn't work well and at the end we just uh speed according to the uh the characters the chunk size I don't I think it's still uh um some experiments which can work hard to tune because uh it's uh splitting could be quite an important thing for us to really retrieve the corresponding like paragraphs so that the users lead on camera and also uh one thing and adding upon upon that is that I think we at the moment don't have the page or some metadat adding to this apart from this paragraph and the later point I think it's also a good idea that we add such meta information such that uh the users could really wrestle and close uh verify the source of the information nice nice yeah no this is this is cool this is cool uh we should definitely uh collaborate about on it in the future um and uh like there's so many ideas in terms of like how you can speed the content in a better way and and it's always like depends on the on the use case right uh so we even have a pretty interesting blog post on like ingesting PDFs and that also talks about like how you split different parts of the PDF and to put it into another lamp like through an um so that's kind of cool cool yeah um yeah I think maybe I do actually an important role yeah because like all those books are basically we need to be split into chunks so that later on we can really retrieve relevant documents for users to check and answer their questions yeah agreed a great thank you for this demo this was super awesome like um I really like how it is like hey it's not just like hey he's a bit of data he's how we search but also like the application of it it immediately resonates for with anyone that had to leave abroad for a bit longer than you know couple of months or holidays um so yeah and then Mark agrees attribution of source is critical for law that's always important to be able to quote where something comes from perfect let's move to the final High Captain demo uh Ricardo you're up next you feeling ready you're amused yes uh that's uh the normal Mantra I still go to the office and I ask my colleagues in front of them if they can hear me um so what's up people this is this is us right we I was joined by an amazing team of colleagues from Colombia right the the place where we're born where we live our entire lives and then we moved to Berlin and we build this what we call cine scripture right there is a tool that we we wanted to create to enable the people to get the content they need when they need it about the things they care right so let me send you an example uh we have a collection of the slack messages right from the Emirates community based on that slack there is a bunch of knowledge that people can easily access right but sometimes it's just hard to get to it right it's hard to get to a bottom of it it's really difficult many channels many conversations many interesting things to see so why don't we just create a tool that enables us to search throughout a amount of content technical conversations uh interesting topics and just get everything consumed in a single video that I can easily see and be entertained with it right so that's the idea behind what we do so what are we using for this right um we were basically taking a taking advantage of 11 laps to generate voice right which is the the kind of the thing for for boys generation text to speech gify because well we want to have fun on Splash we are to somebody right some dramatic viral in the video Open Eye of course to generate the content vbas where we store the uh the slack information the history of slack and we just basically uh took it to get the context and movie pie this is the library that is allowing us to create this amazing video with python so um we managed to clone some voices right we had some fun uh we had the the one of the the main contributors and years of the community which is the Methodist which took his voice and cloned him on 11 laps right which was quite fun um and we also managed to put all the messages from from these public channels on slack and put them on VBS we were able to find approximations to our questions and the topics we were asking architecture is quite simple right you you make a question to retrieve from VBA the semantic search uh then a number of possible answers uh then with shadivity we just give the context sort of DPT we give the context and we ask hey can you please generate a video script based on this a context that we found uh and we'll start generating the elements of the video right generate the text-to-speech which uh with the audio from 11 laps we gathered some images gather some gifs and just measure it into the uh like a hot Tamal uh with movie pie right and then we have our video so let's I mean the the demo is is quite a straightforward right as you see this is what happens when you have a bunch of backend developers and machine learning Engineers working together there is no front end um so we created this uh basically command Console Command right where we send our prompt we send the tone of what we want to do to say Ricardo sorry to interrupt you could you just like make the screen a bit bigger like a comma maybe command plus few times yeah yes thank you perfect perfect and then after after doing that uh it will just start doing oops wait give me just a second because you need quotations so what's the idea what is AI and then you want to have it funny funny yeah funny tone nice if we start quitting bb8 right for the data to get the context after putting vb8 it will create the script with a DBT then it would based on the script we're going to start getting a relevant images and relevant um a gift uh for this to be successful for this video to be engaging uh so here we can see I'll read the script that it was generated right um and and we we're going to start seeing in processing that and getting the each one of the elements now this process might take a lot of time right so I want to jump ahead and see a finished product right now um we have this video here I don't know if I have audio though let's try and let me see let's listen now we can't hear maybe if you can put it on your speaker or something let me let me is it possible for me to reshare uh just a second because I saw the option to share my screen audio but I think I didn't check that box yeah let's do it leaving Living Dangerously give me just a second um yeah the audio is pretty important right because then then you can hear that the voice over that goes over the script yeah the demo at the hackathon was amazing and it was so good so I'm looking forward to uh hearing this here the Metros again you know can never have too much of the matches so you guys are listening now to my audio apparently so let's let's see it no it's not coming through it's not coming through wait keep playing yeah nothing I think you're just getting it in your headset this is not so fun this is the the hardest part like this is the things that I'm not missing about the more work I love reward but this is always difficult hey what we maybe can do is if we have like one of the outputs we could publish it somewhere to YouTube and then we can share it with with our audience on their own time but maybe you could just scroll through like the video because at least the visual part is generated there you can also present video files and like instead of sharing your screen you can also share video file like at least for me I have the option to do a video file yeah let me try that that sounds like an interesting way to do it in just a second well spotted Edwards if all little spells maybe one of us can do a live narration just pretend it's AI but nobody else has cool voices I like to believe that I have a good voice though um I share it though uh maybe you see it is yes um welcome back to another exciting video on our Channel today we're diving deep into the world of artificial intelligence buckle up because we're about to take you on a wild ride now you might be wondering what exactly is artificial intelligence well let me break it down for you in my own quirky way artificial intelligence or AI for short refers to the development of systems that have the ability to display intelligent Behavior by analyzing their environment and taking actions to achieve specific goals think of it as giving machines a brain and teaching them how to make decisions pretty mind-blowing right but hold on before we go any further let me just say that I won't be throwing any external URLs your way nope nope not today we're keeping it all fun and informative right here now ai is all about adding complexity to simple tasks it takes something simple like making a sandwich and turns it into a mind-boggling process who needs a plain old peanut butter and jelly when you can have ai whip up a gourmet Feast for you but let me tell you AI isn't just about sandwiches and gourmet meals it's about applying ancient Chinese philosophy too yup you heard me right Confucianism taoism and Buddhism have joined the AI party apparently these philosophies help explain why some Chinese philosophers aren't as alarmed about AI as their Western counterparts who knew AI could be so Zen but wait there's more we've got a little something called The Phoenix project no it's not about mythical creatures rising from the ashes it's a business novel that explores the application of devops principles in an I.T context trust me it's a must read for anyone who cares about the flow of work in their organization and no worries I won't be sharing any external URLs but you can find the book on a popular Online Marketplace now here's the thing AI isn't just about the tools and the technical side of things it's about integrating people and breaking down those silos just like in devops we need to focus on collaboration and communication so if you're an I.T person working with AI don't forget to reach out and connect with the ml folks who need your infrastructure and tools it's all about teamwork people but hold on we've got a concern here folks there's something called Shadow AI floating around research groups are skipping the it departments and going straight to the end product bodies this leads to small and ineffective AI environments within organizations we need to bridge the gap and make sure that everyone is on the same page I.T folks reach out to your AI counterparts and let's work together to achieve greatness and there you have it a whirlwind tour through the world of artificial intelligence we've covered the basics explored ancient philosophies and peaked into the world of the Phoenix project but before we wrap things up I want to take a moment to say thank you for joining us today we hope you had as much fun as we did if you want to see more entertaining and informative videos like this don't forget to hit that subscribe button and click the notification Bell we've got tons of exciting content coming your way until next time stay curious stay awesome and keep embracing the wondrous world of artificial intelligence signing off your quirky AI assistant that's basically it I am so the Vivid air episode 10 will be Auto generated just play it nice yeah we have some good comments this is insane plus plus you know class plus always is a good comment nice thank you stay awesome stealing the line nice so yeah that's that's basically it right with the theme we have been also we want to share this this is currently uh a GitHub repository open for everyone to participate or just to take advantage here in Haines or four whatever we are going to continue working on it uh it's it's a fun project it's a fun thing to do and it gives it goes a little bit I mean what I what I've seen right and just what they tell what you guys showcased today I'm amazed I'm so humbled to to be here as well seeing all this amazing stuff um and and we we see the opportunity to make something fun right to make something a little bit different uh and we want to for everyone to take advantage of it so yeah serve yourself and have fun yeah nice thank you and we did include the link to your project in the video description so you can definitely find it uh yeah this this was epic I'm looking forward to seeing more of this kind of projects as well nice uh so congratulations uh Nazarene Hawkins Ricardo this was amazing um me hoping that this will be three five minute demo was very ambitious but that's always the case for me but uh definitely worth there therefore at the time that was uh great to see um I just got a vehicle from my mom that she needs my banking information wait Connor lock your laptop yeah Mark Mark is impressive this is great great for efforts um yeah so thank you for efforts so next up now that we're talking about demos uh Edward you when you join like you joined Vivid recently maybe even do like a quick intro who are you what uh what are you doing here why are you at wig and what's your money you want to show okay no pressure before we we start about talking about me I wanted to try to show the video about the hackathon since we since we're about like since we talked about the hackathon yeah do you want to add it to share uh like that like um there you go let me play this [Music] foreign [Music] yeah nice what an epic video we should have opened with it but I didn't know we could share videos so easily earlier hey live and learn right but yeah that was really really nice hackathon and I'm very proud of you all for the amazing demos you did and now it's about me I'm Edward um I actually don't work I just go to cool events I do cool demos and that's it and today I'd like to show you a cool demo that we've been working on so we've been we've seen a lot of demos right now so I'll make it a bit quick so it's a sneak peek yes voila so everyone can see my screen so it's called Health search and it's our cool open source demo it's not public yet but it will be soon and the big idea is that you can use this demo to find like supplements for specific health effects based on the user reviews of these products so you can like we have a cool search bar here and a typical query or something that you would search would be helpful for joint pain and we can press on generate and we get oh this is not working but if it works let me uh live demos not working hey you gotta love a good live demo right demo offline let me just what is going on so the back end is fast API so yeah are you ready to work now give me more yeah I'm sick uh whoop refresh so we get all sorts of products and the cool thing here is that we get like products where they have like user reviews specifically speaking about something positive about joint pain so we can click on any product that we see here and get a more detailed look and we can see here like it only has two reviews but it like it talks about joint pain and like a positive effect and we also made sure that we like annotated or like Mark specific uh keywords So like um diseases symptoms to make it much easier to process what's going on so we can actually go to something with more reviews so this is about blood sugar sleeping breath back pain back pain knees joint care and joint pain and so what we're doing here is semantic search and the really cool thing about this type of search is that you get that you don't do like this keyword matching exactly so that you don't really look for joint pain and like specifically but you get results that are like still semantically related to this type of disease so you have joint health you have joint care um and yeah this is a really cool use case because if you would use like traditional search systems you would miss out many different products and yeah I like that there was like a knee pain example there right so it's like yeah like we all know that knees are joints right or or right all right try this yeah so this is this is pretty cool um yeah and like the big idea behind this is not to really give like we don't build this demo to give Health advice but rather really show the power of semantic search and yeah so and before we actually like even retrieve things there's something cool happening we do like a natural language translation to graphql so we have a right now gpt4 model that like gets in the network language query and then constructs a graphql query and the cool thing about viviate is that you have different endpoints you can use to actually talk to the database we have graphql but you can you also have a pythonic API you can use or also do everything on typescript but for this demo we used graphql and the really exciting thing is now um it can actually understand sorry my doors my door is running raining is it important I don't know hey the beauty of live sessions huh Sebastian talk about anything all right I'll talk about something right now this is this is super easy FDA at the door isn't it yeah basically FDA at your door right here arrested one you're gone um that's that's a cool like um I you see this like the kind of project that like really show the value um and like having a nice interface you know flashing colors and everything that always helps um but that's yeah definitely really cool to see and um I know that that's the best thing that like I think uh Edward built it like within his first week at the other company so um it's that's I like this kind of this project right like where you straight up heated beak on on week one was it FDA no it was just a last package so what are your medicines my medicine yeah there was my supplements I bought that's nice that's a quick uh quick delivery yeah that's how the health search for you okay so you can actually like I choose now products for sleep from the now food brand and it actually could understand what I'm what I like what my goal is so it added a filter that filters the brand based like on now foods and now we only get um products from now food now Foods or you can also say like best rated product for energy and it understands your like what you want and now sorts based on the rating and this is really cool because you can like really because in search it's so important to understand what the user wants and this is a really cool like experimental demo how you can actually utilize it and then get the products that the user exactly wants so this is the first thing that that is happening then you do like then you retrieve all the things to semantic search and now we have something that is very cool which is called generative search and maybe you've noticed it like there's some text coming here and this is a generated product summary so another cool thing that vv8 has are the modules which you can use to enhance your search results and we're using the generate module here specifically so what it does is it looks at the top five uh results that you retrieve and it does a product summary on it and the nice thing is that it's like referencing your query like the help of a joint pain and it's a kind of question answering thing going on here but this really makes every Search unique so right now like based on the query here's the summary of products blah blah and then it's like names them and tells what is going on there and we also do that for every product itself like we do a review summary and this way you can really easily get a good sense of what the product is like about and what health effects it might have so this is this product seems to be effective in really enjoying pain blah blah or for example no significant health benefits or effects affects mentioned so like it makes information more digestible and it's pretty also if I I really like this use case for like generative search because it makes your life easier and as you've noticed like these results are coming pretty fast so of course I'm caching them by the scenes but I'm not using any cache I'm using viviate again as cache and why is this good because also natural language queries can be very similar so you yet like you can have different wordings but you mean the same thing and we don't really want to waste computational power for queries that like that we already already cached but they're like worded differently so for example let's say instead of helpful let's say good for joint pain and what happens behind the scenes is um yeah I can't can't show at you because I have this screen but it first looks uh if we have like a keyword matching um like if this query as it is is already in Cache if not we're doing like semantic search again so and we also also have like a threshold a distance threshold and if we find a query that is semantically similar to ours we would just retrieve or return the same results as we did for the helpful one so we can see still like the helpful thing in the concepts blah blah but if we typed in bad for joint pain I also cached that one but we get get a different set of results because bad for joint pain is semantically completely different than good for joint pain and I think also like using semantic search as a cache is super interesting and yeah so this demo will be open sourced once it's ready and everyone can like we also host the demo publicly and we also want to provide a open source template so that people can just drag and drop their own data set and just have the same stuff going on maybe not all features included because this demo is loaded with a lot of features but yeah just to like uh jump start projects and it already has like review it integrated and you just have to whatever data set you have because this like everything I just showed you you can use it on any data set you can do talk about wines or bicycles or Suites or teddy bears yeah the possibilities are endless and that's everything thanks for listening great demo and a super fast delivery that was very impressive for sure um and there's even a suggestion you know maybe we can generate a video for it like come combine you know like uh throw like a German law book at it you know and then even better this ring can like generate some of the code for you so at the moment we do graphql but maybe in the serene's agent can help us generate the python code or maybe other languages so hey combine the forces between the four of us four of you like they'll be amazing so uh excellent thank you for the demo great start so we have two more quick ones to go over um I don't see any more questions so maybe the next segment uh done can you walk us through the Vivid Forum leaderboard so that basically I have a way to send people t-shirts or maybe some other coursework for sure so our Forum has picked up speed since the last time we talked about it or maybe there and we have a lot of topics in the support category which is the most popular and here you can see that I have a bit of a new design flare topics that don't have an answer are colored in this uh pinkish color and there's this checkbox it doesn't check next to them well solve topics have up check box what that means is that the topic has a solution so if um our goal is to reduce the number of unfold topics we are still have some work to do there but some things are just not so clear-cut and there's that one short but essentially what happens is every time a topic has a solution the user Who provided a solution in this case myself gets applied and there is a leaderboard with these users at forum.video.io leaderboard and that redirects to this users page with different typeframes so overall since we launched the Forum GDP is number one congrats and then we have this shorter time frames with month and quarter and this is where Sebastian will step in and a word some prizes to Winners who are outside of our team so there's somebody this is like in the lead for it for sure um I'm not sure we're avoiding it right now right now or or maybe you know hey it's a good excuse to uh send somebody a t-shirt already um but yeah we should probably do it at the end of every month uh check out uh who's uh had the biggest contribution or if there's several people yeah let's reward everybody that's a cool game to play and uh JP if you want to get a free Vivi t-shirt just resign and then continue answering the questions for free and I will send you a t-shirt how's that that's so weird because I've sent you that email already I've already quit so all right bye reject it I am not accepting any of that nice nice um perfect yeah this is super cool I I didn't even know that uh this course had this feature for for the leaderboard but it's really cool to see you can also see who reads a lot of the posts so that's pretty cool yeah all of this is public if you go under users and you can sort by all sorts of metrics here in the support category there is another way to sort by replies if you want to address topics and perhaps bring that checkbox and you can further filter by what's unsolved so take your Peak Community from here and help us reduce this thing topics perfect nice cool this is this was exciting um just a little bit um we had some very interesting Thanos today and we'd love to see them in the Showcase section whenever they are made public I saw the running from localhost right now but if you want to share them in the Showcase section we can also link to your presentation during this live stream which has been recorded oh yeah so Ricardo you already have your project on GitHub right so you could technically create a post maybe even embed a small video or something yeah that'll be cool you see you came here and learned something pretty cool how cool is that nice thanks for sharing this Dan uh cool and uh last but not least um oh there is a compliment for Edward uh Edward this is great the mathematician in me wants to ask what distance metric yeah I just answered this it's called like a default is cosine but we have a lot of other things that we that are available at least but I didn't change to change the metric metric it's cosine cool cool I also curious how you highlighted those matching words like knee pain as a match for drain plane that's a good question so um for my bachelor's thesis I wrote a healthcare nmp pipeline that like extracts diseases and symptoms but also like positive effects like sleep or mood and I just reused it like I just ran all the reviews on it and then so that for every review I got like a list of um like conditions or symptoms and I and also like the position the character position and I used it to highlight them so I used my NLP pipeline to like enhance the cool reviews very nice and uh yeah and also on the topic of distance metrics I am going to share it but we actually have a blog post for it uh if you anyone is curious there's like the distance metrics in Vector search unfortunately I can't post links in the in the chat or YouTube just doesn't allow us to share links in there but we can always add it later in the video description perfect so uh leaving last or the best for last or how we say it uh JP tell us about Academy because you teased it up in the past but we finally launched it so it's now your moment to shine yeah thanks it's it's been a long gestating topic for sure I'll keep it brief as well um so we're launching this thing called we be at Academy some of you might have seen it this is really really exciting and fun for me um and obviously like doing Vector search and learning about it it's quite a lot of things you have to learn about you have to learn about like deep learning language models or NN algorithms or and even just how databases work right and it's just a lot and I was like amazed at how much the hackathon folks had got done within a day um but if you want to sort of um you know learn about abbreviate and all these different topics that are perhaps less of a like a cauldron of high pressure um this is kind of what we be at Academy is for so we designed it to be more of a holistic course from start to finish um as you'll see these are arranged into um names so these are topics what we're calling courses and each course will include multiple what we call units so it's like subjects you know in the context of like learning units um so you can go through that one by one it's sequential so it includes like video content unfortunately you're gonna have to see more of my my mug so you may or may not get sick of me throughout the throughout the course so there's content with videos and the videos introduce the um the the concepts as well as exercises you've got to go through through the units and then courses so yeah that's that's kind of what it is and it's designed to design to be self-guided and self-paced which should be um sort of you know suitable for anyone learning at any pace and you can skip units if you've seen a lot of this content already um so we've got the zero 10 BP course launched some of you have seen that in the preview phase but it's now linked from the main website so under the developer tab you can click on Academy or you can click on the little um I never know what this hat is called um the academic hat basically so you can click on that icon to get there um I thought that was a ninja star you know because you always throw it at people right or that's what I would I don't personally you can't prove it um so not me um and and there's also these like Standalone units which are coming later as well so we're gonna have Standalone units on how to select vectorizers and how to deal with media that's not just text and document chunking which you already had questions about earlier today I've been questioned to you know Hawkins um Amazing Project as well so the idea is to guide we get users and kind of like make it easier to learn about all these different Technologies and Sciences behind the scenes which is really really cool um so yeah please feel free to check it out I will definitely encourage you to check it out and give us feedback on what you like what you don't like and what you want to see because we've got some things in the pipeline that are being recorded and prepared but of course we'll listen to your feedback about what you want to see more of or we you know if you have feedback about this structure as well um so yeah that's that's me I'm really excited to see where this goes and to have people on this journey together perfect thank you JP this is super exciting and uh great work yeah great work and um you know you can never have too much of JP's face right like so we are what you know I'm going on vacation literally this is the last thing I'm going to do uh until I'm taking like two and a half weeks off and you know what I may watch a cheeky uh one or two of JP videos you know just for the fun of it like you know why not learn something about Vector databases so um thank you all for watching uh this was an amazing episode with loads of demos thank you very much to our special guest uh Nathan Hawken uh and Ricardo uh welcome all to Edward Edward thanks JP and Dan this was amazing uh by the way if you uh wanna you know find us like so we shared even LinkedIn profiles for honestly Nelson Ricardo and Oakland likes you can always uh find them uh in uh some of them may be looking for a job you never know um so it's it's great to do that like let us know how you like this episode drop us some comments uh if you if any of you have something cool to share and show uh you I would like to open the invitation uh just like Dan mentioned earlier you know like get yourself on that leaderboard maybe you can help us out and one of those cool t-shirts or maybe even a better one uh so yeah we already see like some people excited about the episode The Yoga is going to be be back that's great to hear and great team uh well great job team from Erica this is actually the first episode that Erica didn't participate in so uh but it's good that we we had her you know at least you know somewhere in the spirit so that's good to uh to see so these are my final words uh thank you all for your time and then see you next time bye ", "type": "Video", "name": "weaviate_air__episode_9", "path": "", "link":
