{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the 58th episode of the Weaviate Podcast! I am SUPER excited to welcome ... \nthank you so much for watching the wevia \npodcast I'm super excited to welcome \nAndre moliar from gnomec Ai and quickly \nbefore diving in this is Christmas come \nearly for people working with weeviate \nand Vector embeddings no mix Atlas \nvisualization of embeddings is just \namazing it's so cool to see these \nclusters and we have an integration with \nweeviate to show but even before talking \nabout that huge congratulations nomic AI \non raising a 17 million dollar series a \nI can see in the uh the press release \nannouncement Atlas gbt for all all these \namazing Technologies so firstly before \neven getting into any of the technical \nstuff huge congratulations to everyone \nat nomeg AI this is just amazing to see \nand I'm so excited about how this space \nis developing so let's get into that a \nlittle more about what this means of \nspace developing so uh maybe you've seen \nthis kind of thing before this is topic \nmodeling we've had past podcasts with \nsay Martin Gruden doors from Bert topic \nyou know trying to understand how this \nkind of stuff integrates with wiiate but \nso what you have is you know you take \nall your documents and you embed them \nsay with open AI embedding things that \nare 15 36 dimensions and then you \nproject that into a lower dimensional \nspace with say tsne umap and so on and \nthen you visualize the lower dimensional \nspace then you cluster and so then you \ncould like cluster the two-dimensional \npoints or you know you come up with \nthese topic labels for these different \nkind of labels so you see like um if you \nzoom in these are like the point Cloud \nsegmentation this is these are \nembeddings for all the papers published \nin nuribs from 1987 to 2022 so \nyou know these kind of maps are so \ninteresting and so here's this tutorial \non how to get your data from weviate to \nnomic Atlas for this visualization you \nknow flowing the vectors from Eva to \nnomec all the super exciting stuff \npersonally I've added this to my wevia \npodcast search demo to play around with \nit this is like my dog food I use to see \nwhat all these things look like and so \nso what you see is you know you can take \nyour data out of levia put it into this \nspace and um uh hopefully that's a good \nvisualization uh oh yeah sorry so let me \njust increase the point size somebody's \na little clearer but you can see how \neach of these podcast Clips you can see \nthe topics you click clustering and \ntopic modeling podcast Clips we were \ntalking about clustering and topic \nmodeling but anyway so this was so much \nfun to play with with my own data and I \nhope you know you enjoy seeing your data \nlike this I think it's we'll get into it \non the podcast but I think this is one \nof the most exciting ways to understand \nthe quality of your embedding spaces you \nknow it's one way to compare embedding \nmodels is to see the latent spaces \nproduced by them and you know whether \nthese topics make sense whether you \nagree with the Clusters and so on so \nwithout going into it too much further \nI'm so excited to present this podcast \nwith Andre this was such an exciting one \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching the weevier podcast I'm super \nexcited to welcome Andre moliar Andre is \nthe founder of nomec AI nomik is doing \nso many exciting things for one example \nthey have done this uh embedding \nvisualization directly in the browser at \n10 million scale and Beyond it's so \nexciting to see Andre is also the \ncreator of GPT for all which is another \nlike topic that I'm sure everyone has \nheard about so Andre I'm so excited to \ntalk to you and learn how you think \nabout all these topics hey Connor thanks \nfor having me awesome so could we kick \nthis off by diving into the founding \nstory of nomec uh like what led you down \nthis space sure yeah so like I think \nevery good ml story it starts at a nurbs \nmachine learning conference \num this was like uh 2019 \num and uh this is when everyone in ml \ncared about images and nobody knew that \nthat machine learning models were just \nthese amazing manipulators of text even \nthough Transformers have been out for \nabout two years and I actually ended up \ngoing to this uh it was it was a bird \nMeetup so Bert was uh so before everyone \nwas naming um naming models after like \nllamas and alpacas it was Sesame Street \ncharacters and there was this Meetup for \nuh for Bert which was like this model \nthat released released in 20 2018 which \nwas a Transformer model trained to sort \nof uh self-supervise over text and then \nyou can do all these magical things with \ntext that you couldn't do before and at \nthat Meetup I actually met my co-founder \nBrandon um so Brandon CEO nomik he uh I \nwas actually working at the time at this \nstartup called red AI which was nowadays \nyou call them generative AI startups \nback then you call them machine learning \nstartups that uh things with text \num and what they were doing is basically \nsummarizing Radiology reports \nautomatically with large neural networks \nand you can imagine because they're \nusing at the time because fours came out \nthis is the one that always seems to \nbecame feasible \num and so we sort of met up there uh \nBrandon and I ended up working there \ntogether for about a year and we found \nout all these sort of difficulties that \nexisted in training large-scale \nTransformer models on large quantities \nof text this is like way back before \ngbt3 even came out \num and so like we took those learnings \nand basically the tldr the learnings is \nthat you need to look at your data uh \nevery every everything in the process \nabout big neural network on a lot of \ntexts will eventually become replicable \num everything from the data ingestion \nall the way to the model training the \nmodel serving uh Mosaic ml for example \nis doing great things I'm like training \nreplicable \num but the hardest part is always making \nsure you have your data curated in the \nright way so that was sort of like this \nlike clear non-repocable problem that we \nsaw uh we sort of went to different ways \nafter the company \num and right now let's go work at Square \nuh I went to start a PhD at NYU working \non Interpol machine learning and about \nsix months in uh basically what happened \nis Brandon reached out to me he's like \nhey we both know this problem exists \nlet's let's let's let's look at solving \nit and sort of like the the interface \nthat we imagined for how we would have \nwanted at the time to go about curating \nlarge contents of unstructured text and \nlike a replica mirror to make it faster \nwas sort of this interface that you see \nin our product Atlas right now right now \num this this this this idea that when \nyou're going through and exploring large \ncollections of data you really really \nwant the property where when you find \none example of something bad or \nsomething good you find all of the \nexamples of eating this is actually a \nproperty that you only get when you're \nlooking for data through the context of \nClick through like the lens of a neural \nnetwork through the embedding space of a \nneural network that's what Atlas was at \nits core Atlas was this sort of solution \nto our problem that we had where we have \nyou know 60 million documents of text \nyou to clean them very very quickly and \nfigure out what's in there uh and that \nAtlas was the sort of like answer to \nthat uh like overarching problem that \nbecame developing and building \nbut that's sort of like the the the \nGenesis of note \num and we sort of sort of started out \nworking on that uh we had sort of the \nMVP uh in beginning of Spring 2022 \num we went out uh built out sort of like \nwhat you see right now in Atlas when you \nwhen you go to atlas.nomic.ai uh where \nyou can go in just drop your data sets \nand you get these sort of observable \nsort of data maps that allow you to see \ntens of millions of pieces of text \nimages audio anything you can embed with \na neural network all on one screen and \nthen be able to slice a dice and \nmanipulate it just like you would \nmanipulate for instance something in a \npandas data frame but you don't need to \nbe technical \num so that's what you see right now \nyeah that that's a really compelling \nStory I mean I there's so many to so \nmany stuff to that I think yeah I also \nfirst became aware like coming back to \nthe neurops conference I think I I first \nsaw Atlas um with the visualizations of \nthe iclr papers of clustering them and \ndoing that kind of thing and I thought \nthat was so cool that's how I first saw \nthis whole topic modeling cluster \nanalysis idea but you've hit this angle \nthat I think is so fascinating of the \ndata visualization for curating training \ndata for large language models \nespecially when you're talking about \npre-training them and doing the internet \nscale uh language modeling I think for \nme I first saw this data set called the \npile with which is like 800 gigabytes \nand you had like this you know a nice \nlike diagram with the squares of like \nhow much is Wikipedia how much is GitHub \nand that was kind of like my first thing \nof seeing like the composition of the \ndata sources you mentioned Mosaic ml \nthey're doing a lot to educate here's \nwhere our data comes from the mix of it \nfor say MPT and you know I know uh with \nGoogle research quarkly is someone I've \nbeen following for a long time and they \nhave a paper called I think it's called \nsomething like that where it's about the \ncomposition again like this \ninvestigation um is if we could stay on \nthat a little more like so you know I \nlove what you said also about finding \nproblems in your data set by looking at \nthe nearest neighbors so so you take you \nyou know you take 10 million or you know \nmassive scale used to train a language \nmodel and you embed it all into Atlas \nand then you start looking at like you \nknow here is where the high loss region \nis like you know your model performed \nbadly on this point so the neighboring \npoints tend to correlate is that how \nyou're thinking about kind of how you \nthen use this interface to improve the \ntraining data yeah so that's one way you \ncan use it um that's actually not the \nway that we had an envisioned in mind \nit's just like a useful way of using the \ninterface we're specifically debugging \nfor instance large language model \nfine-tunes that we discover the thing \nyou just mentioned looking at like \nthese sort of like \ninitial \num the the initial reason we sort of \nbuilt it out built out Atlas was this \nidea that \nthe reason that large language models \nhallucinate and we saw this we were \nworking at this medical AI company right \nwhen you deploy when you're deploying \nmachine learning model in like a medical \nsetting you cannot have like a model \nthat generates sex hallucinate right you \ndon't have a problem it's on a medical \nAid product the model hallucinates and \nthe sort of core core reason that \nhallucinations occur \num and we were able to stamp this out \nactually while working there is because \nof spurious correlations in the training \ndata that is there are things in the \ntraining data that shouldn't be seen \ntogether at the model at the same time \nwhile it's training \num and to be able to Stamp Those out uh \nyou just need to have some way of very \nquickly sort of like scrubbing over all \nof your data to figuring out to figure \nout what's in it but then when you find \none example of something that's in it \nthat you need to remove uh you should be \nable to very quickly find all of those \nexamples and this is sort of where like \nvector databases come into play right uh \nthey allow you know once you have one \nexample if you're looking through it \nthrough the lens of like a neural \nNetwork's embeddings you can find all of \nthe examples \nand what you see with Atlas is sort of \nlike you can think of it as a as a \nvisualizer for the vector database like \nthe the sort of like my MySQL workbench \nfor for the for the relational database \nthat you see for a vector you can see \nthe high dimensional embedding structure \nprojected down into two Dimensions well \nwe're both preserving the the sort of \nproperties and patterns that you see in \nthe high dimensional embeddings but you \nsee those in two dimensions of that list \nyeah and I think if we could stay on \nthis a little further so I've I've \nbecame really interested in topic \nmodeling I interviewed Martin grudendors \nabout Bert topic uh so I like jumping \nahead to the kind of this topic of like \nyeah topic the topic of topic modeling \nhow are you currently thinking about its \napplications uh yeah yeah \num so the way we think about it is as \nfollows right uh every single piece of \ndata uh in the next decade will be run \nthrough some neural network whether you \nhave texts being run through a \nTransformer pre-trained represent text \nwhere you whether you have large \nlanguage models generating piles of \ncontent to the internet that you need to \nsomehow make sure you know isn't going \nto ruin the world and ruin the elections \nor whether it's images audio running \nthrough all the latest various neural \nnetworks that are coming out and what \nyou really want to be able to do is make \nsense of all this embedded data that \nexists out there so Atlas under the hood \nit's sort of built out as sort of this \nfile system where you can just dump in \nbeddings and then get super powers over \ntop of them uh so one of those \nsuperpowers is visualization that we \nwere just talking about that allows you \nto find patterns in your embeddings \num another one of these is topic \nmodeling \nso what this allows you to do is find \nlike a homogeneous regions of your \nembedding space so like once you find a \ncluster in your embedding space that \nexists \num what we do is we ensure that that \ncluster can be representable and sort of \naccessed over like HTTP API calls for \nexample or just like access to house so \nin beddings that are all similar \ntogether sort of get represented as sort \nof one topic with your \ns and yeah I think without so like I \nguess let me let me put it in the \ncontext just like a builder right when \nwe were building out Atlas \num the very first thing we did is we \nimplemented the sort of dimensionality \nreduction algorithm that scaled to tens \nof millions of embeddings which doesn't \nexist you take umap or or \num or tease me out of the box you're not \ngoing to be able to scale tens of \nmillions of the betting so we had to \nsort of implement our own \num and once that was there it was \nawesome look you could see all of these \ndots on a screen and we would show it to \npeople and they'd be like wow this is so \ncool what does this mean this makes no \nsense \num and topic models were sort of the \nthing that allowed us to start educating \npeople who are like maybe not like ml \nexperts as to what they were looking at \nbecause you could very very easily get \nout get out sort of the trends that you \nwere seeing you would see like those \ncluster protection it actually is \nhomologous it's all the same color for \nexample on the sort of 2D map view that \nyou see in Atlas \num and then sort of like the next \nupgrade was like topic labels for \nexample uh you could go in and see uh \nnot only for instance if you had \nembeddings of text you cannot see not \nonly like the actual topics uh via the \nclustering that you see on the map but \nyou could actually see like high level \nhuman descriptions of those of labels \num and so this sort of like Segway is \nalso in the GPT for all I don't want to \nget get too much in there but you have \nto generate those automatically somehow \nright \nyeah yeah and of course we're coming \nwe're going to talk about gbt for all \nbut and yeah the ability of gbt for all \nto you know maybe do like a \nsummarization chain as we've seen like \nLang chain summarization chain using the \nyou know gbt4 models makes perfect sense \nof the gbt for all could be plugged into \nthat but yeah summarizing the topic this \nkind of automatic category Discovery is \nso fascinating there's kind of one other \nidea I wanted to uh ask you about I I've \nheard this question from people like one \nof my conferences and stuff is they want \nto say you know take customer reviews \ndump them into this kind of thing see \nthe you know clusters of their product \nreviews and then they want to do this \nkind of thing of like the automatic \nDiscovery from that I also think about \nmaybe if there is a connection with the \nsymbolic metadata associated with each \ncluster so you know you have three \nclusters and then say you know say it's \nlike my tweets and I like you know I \ncluster my tweets and then I say like \nthis cluster has like you know this has \nthe most Impressions like the \ncategory of tweet however they're \nembedded in the space and so I kind of \nvisualize my clusters with symbolic data \nas well you think about that kind of \napplication a lot of like yeah I guess \nlike symbolic data as well for \nunderstanding what makes these clusters \ndiffer from each other yeah I mean so \nlike at its core what Atlas is showing \nyou is not like black magic it's showing \nyou cystical properties that the \nunderlying model that embedded the data \nhas sort of learned \num and sometimes it is the case that for \nexample the metadata that you've seen \nhumans associate or like a platform like \nTwitter associate with your data is \nactually already captured in the \nembeddings so that's why you see for \ninstance if you go on Atlas and you \ncolor by a piece of metadata you'll see \nlike it sort of replicates what the \ntopics discovered because the top the \ntopics are sort of like an unsupervised \nway of seeing uh properties of that \nvetting space but if you have this \nmetadata attached to your data it also \ncan be you know explicitly represented \num and yeah so like \nat its core uh you should be able to \nsort of discover these patterns and we \ntry to we try to really be like um \nwhat's the word like we don't we don't \ntell you how to use the platform it's \nsort of your job to use it as sort of a \ndiscovery tool \num like when you're going through and \nactually doing the visual discovery of \nof what what your embedding space of \nyour data represents \num and to like to your question it's a \nlittle bit difficult to \num \nif you have a model that can represent \nyour data uh in such a way that it's \ncaptured all the various properties that \nyou'd want to make you all the various \nproperties of your data that you'd want \nto use for some business purpose \num then yeah awesome uh the unsupervised \nsort of like system that we have built \nout with uh dimensionality reduction and \nthe topic labeling yeah that can \nautomatically sort of give you access to \nsort of these sort of attributes but \nusually like you have some sort of like \nthing over top of it that you really \ncare about this is why for instance like \nvector databases like we V8 right \nmetadata filtering is so important you \ncan't just do Vector search and I'm like \nyou know you're done right metadata \nfiltering is everything \num so having access meta is like super \nsuper important and the embedding space \nsometimes represents it sometimes it \ndoesn't uh but you need a way of seeing \nit right \nI yeah I've also been thinking about \nthat kind of the category Discovery from \ntopic modeling to be used in filtered \nVector search I guess my thing with that \nparticular line of thinking is that if \nit's a property that's captured in the \ncluster then the hnsw then the you know \nthe graph in the vector index will \nalready kind of capture that \nthis is where I'm a little torn on that \nparticular part of it but but I really \nthis idea of like debugging embedding \nmodels is something I really want to get \ninto as well like so so like we talk \nabout um use training language models \nwith this data and visualizing the \ntraining data for language models so is \nit thinking mostly around visualizing \nhow the Clusters evolved from the latent \nspace of the language model or say are \nyou also using this a lot for like the \ntraining of the embedding models \nthemselves like maybe just to give a \nlittle more background like I my dog \nfooding data set with leviate is this \npodcast I like to like take these \ntranscriptions and put them into the \nvector space and so I've been thinking \nlike I've been training embedding models \nin this particular data and I can \nimagine like visualizing the Clusters \nevolving over time like as I add this \nnew podcast with Andre and then see how \ntraining on this data set changes my \nwhole Space could be really interesting \nso that kind of debugging models yeah \nbut here's how you think about that with \nno money yeah I mean I really think that \neveryone should be everyone should be \nlooking through their looking at their \ndata through the lens of embeddings \num and embedding like data changes over \ntime right so embeddings will change \nover time \num one of the things that you can that \nwe it actually is not concretely \nimplemented right now as sort of like a \nnative way but one very natural way \nwhere embedding change over time is sort \nof the suitcase of like debugging like \nmachine learning modeling frames as a \nmodel trains right every time let's say \nyou do an evaluation on your like Dev \nset what happens is you generate a new \nset of embeddings and it's for every \nsingle test point that you have in your \ndata set you get an embedding of that \ntest point out and the organization of \nthose embeddings is basically a proxy \nfor how the neural network is organizing \nyour data \num and the embedding space sort of gives \nyou a human way a sort of a human \ninterpretable lens at looking at what \nyour model is learning and what your \nmodel is not learning we have this like \nreally nice demo example on mnist uh \nwhere you can go away to like like a \npytorch lightning hook with Atlas hooked \nin to train your model on every single \nEpoch you'll sample you'll sample like a \nview of the embedding space and you can \nvery much see like the digits form over \ntime \num that reflects in like the like the \nlike quantitative metrics like the like \nsort of like accuracy that you see over \nthose 10 digits but you can really see \nlike as the model trains the embedding \nspace sort of like molds like Play-Doh \nand like the eights and the zeros are \ncloser together than the eights and the \nsevens because well you know the \nembeddings for those are are are putting \nthem apart there's there's more data \npoints where it's where eights and zeros \nare being sort of like together causing \nlike errors in your actual quantitative \nmetrics but you can all you can see this \nwhole visually so it's a good debug for \nmodel trains as well \nyeah that that's so compelling I the \nyeah I think I've seen an animation of \nthat before of the light in space \nevolving on emness probably probably \nfrom Atlas where I saw that that is so \ncool and okay so I really want to come \nback to this kind of topic modeling and \nproperty Discovery topic later on the \npodcast but for now I think we have to \ndive into gbt for all you know you've \nhit the Grand Slam home run and AI of \ncreating the model that everyone's \ntalking about how's your experience with \nthis man yeah \num so it was really cool uh I'm not \ngonna lie it was it was it was it was \nfun uh like usually when you build an ml \nmodel uh you read like at least like \nwhen I was doing like more research work \nas part of my day-to-day you build an ml \nmodel you spell multiple months building \nit and what happens is you go in and you \nwrite this big paper and you like \nrelease it out and then you hit you hear \nlike chirps about it and like this is \nlike even before like everyone was like \nbasically publishing their Research on \nTwitter \num so it's a discussion \num \nyou would not get any feedback about it \nit was just it was really cool to sort \nof work with the team to get a model out \nthat everyone really cared about but I \nthink \nGPT for all is not really about like hey \nthere's this cool model and like \neveryone should use it and try it \num because like the model itself it's \nworse than for instance like what you \nwould get with a large language model \nAPI if you use like anthropic or open AI \nbut that's not sort of like the the key \ningredient the key ingredient is you can \nown your actual model the model runs \nlocally and that only does it run \nlocally you don't need some accelerated \nHardware like an Nvidia chip you can run \nit on your CPU so that's that was sort \nof the whole premise of GPT for all to \nsort of do a demonstration that with the \ncurrent set of ingredients that it \nemerged in sort of the technology stack \nso like the work of the gergenov and on \nllama that's CPP uh the work at meta \nsort of like accidentally releasing out \nthese llama models that everyone wasn't \nsupposed to have access to but somehow \neveryone found the turrets for \num and like all these ingredients have \ncome together uh to really demonstrate \nthat large language models aren't these \nlike big black boxes that exist behind \nthe apis of cloud servers of a few big \nplayers you could run them locally on \nyour machines that was sort of the \nthesis of GPT for all do a demonstration \nof this \num and then it turns out everyone really \ncared about it so we were like hey we \nshould maybe put spend some more time on \nthis \nyo I think you just hit the pinata with \nso many things I mean like first of all \nit was pretty fast after the release and \nthen the public reaction to Chachi BT \nthat you got this out I mean this must \nhave been like three months later \nmaximum so it's like the speed of it is \nastonishing the as you mentioned running \nit on the CPU with the Llama C plus \nthat's like pretty crazy and then it's \nlike I do I'm a little curious about so \nso the the nature of this is you have a \npre the pre-trained checkpoint from \nllama which comes from meta and then you \nfine-tune this to create gbt for all so \nthat would be that was in fact the \noriginal model \num we sensed sort of like the models so \nif you go around like GPT for all.io and \nyou go in and you sort of download this \nUI installer that lets you play around \nwith any of these local models \num the reason we need this UI installer \nyou can't just like go on GitHub is \nbecause it's a lot more accessible \num it you basically we solve all the \nsoftware challenges that you used to \nexist like for instance when we first \nreleased GPT for all what you needed to \ndo is you needed to go in and like \ndownload this GitHub this git repository \nuh code it down and then you know \nnon-technical people don't know how to \ndo that you know it's kind of accessible \noh you need to go take this random four \ngigabyte file from the internet wait \nseven minutes for it to download and \nthen drag directory and then like you \nyou run some terminal commands and that \nwas the setup process now it's a little \nbit easier it's all the EQ and it's all \nthis desktop client \num and that's sort of like the chat in \nthe chat UI that you see there and it \nisn't just llama models uh you have \nmodels that are based on sort of like \nmore like less less licensed restricted \narchitectures like gptj or MPT \num we actually just uh so this is not \nreleased yet but I guess it'll be \nreleased by the time this podcast comes \nout uh Falcon is about to launch very \nsoon so sort of like the the the move \nover the last few months has been we \nwant to get the least restrictively \nlicensed models in the hands of as many \npeople as possible uh because that is \nthe way you ensure that these systems \ncan be deployed safe uh but the deployed \nsafely \num \nso that's what we sort of been building \nwith GPT for all uh and the core Focus \nhas really been on like software \necosystem stability uh the model the \nmodel is amazing as you can if you can \ngo you can go and hug and face look up \nthe word ggml and find million like \nMillions hundreds of models that exist \nthat are all different versions of like \nLlama fine-tuned Or MPT fine-tuned or \ngbtj fine-tuned and they're all sort of \njust like they're there uh sometimes \nit's hard to use because the sort of \nsoftware ecosystem doesn't uh support \nall of them because there's a lot of \nbreaking changes being introduced in \nsort of like the core components that \nmakes them make them make these models \nrun fast on CPU the ggml or llama CPP \nand sort of what we try to do at GPT for \nall is make it easy to use for Everyone \nby like eliminating all those like \nsoftware errors that you might encounter \nand also create like sort of the most \nstable ecosystem all the way down from \nlike a c plus code that's optimized to \ninteract with your L2 and L3 caches of \nyour CPT CPU architectures all the way \nup to like the docker images with HTTP \nAPI so you can deploy into production \nand we try to give it out for free under \nApache 2 license uh that's sort of like \nthe the the the the the the the the the \nthesis everyone should have access to \nthis technology \nyeah I mean um I learned a little bit \nabout this l2l3 cache like the \noptimization for CPU inference with deep \nlearning from speaking with Michael \ngoing at neural magic and learning about \nyou know what neuromagic is doing around \nCPUs is I think it's really hard to \nundersell like how impactful that can be \nrunning it on the CPU because it makes \nit so much cheaper to sample all these \ninferences and then you couple that with \nlike the auto gbt strategy of coming up \nwith these action plans and like you \nknow or like gbt team is like another \nexample of like you know you have role \nplaying uh llms that communicate with \neach other and with CPU inference being \nso fast it's also fascinating but I \nquickly before maybe if we talk more \nabout the implications of models like \nthis I want to get a little more into \nhow you train this so you know things \nlike say the low rank adaptation like \nbecause because I always you know these \nmodels typically have come from like \nGoogle open AI micro like billions of \ndollars you know big so like how how are \nyou able to you know yeah let's let's be \nclear here like what what GPT for all \nhas built stands on the shoulder like \nthe very broad gigantic shoulders right \nlike we put a bunch of ingredients \ntogether and spend a bunch of time \ncurating data like we use Atlas to \ncurate the data that was that was sort \nof like the edge that we had we can very \nquickly take a large a large collection \nof data make it clean so we can train \nthe model into that model actually be \nlike useful to interact with they can \nfeel like chat GPT even though it wasn't \nthe type of quality of chat \num and on most tasks uh like sort of the \ntasks that required like a reasoning \ncreative tasking is pretty good \num so like the ingredients like what are \nthe ingredients to make a GPT for all \nthat's I guess the question you're \nasking uh the ingredients are as follows \nuh number one \num you need a very \nyou need a very strong pre-trained model \nbackbone that is a model of a large \nTransformer model that has been \npre-trained on a whole internet worth of \ndata trillions of trillions of words \ntokens \num you need a model like that uh that's \nvery expensive it costs millions of \ndollars to train a lot like that \nthankfully Meadow did this thing where \nthey opened where they released one for \nresearchers to use in an open source \nfashion so the research Community can \nbuild around it \num so that happened and now but everyone \nelse is doing this right so the UAE \nreleased the Falcon model recently \nMosaic released MPT but the ingredient \nis a very very strong backbone because \nwithout a model that knows about \nlanguage you can't fine tune a model \nthat can be a chat assistance uh the \nsecond ingredient that you need is a lot \nof high quality data of humans \ninteracting with chat models now what we \ndid uh in March is we found this really \nnice high quality model that you might \nhave heard of it's called chat GPT \num and we took a bunch of examples \nby giving it questions that humans might \nask uh to \num sample what its responses would be so \nwe basically went on hugging face got a \nbunch of data sets of people like \nprompting uh models to do difficult \ntasks like write poems or like answer a \nquestion thoughtfully or use like Chain \nof Thought reasoning to produce out \nproduce out of half put and we sample \nthose responses I took that big \npre-trained backbone so long up and we \ntrained it over top of that data to be \nable to act like a China system so a \nchat assistant has to know you know no \none to stop answering uh have some idea \nof like who it is what it can and can't \ndo \num and the way we were able to actually \nmanipulate that data such that you can \nput it put it into training is using \nthat tool Atlas we were just talking \nabout uh there's many there's many ways \nyou can do it but the reason Atlas was \nimportant is because if you sh if you \ntrain with data that for instance has a \nlot of duplicates in it or the data is \nnot diverse what happens is the model \nsort of the fine-tuned model that you \nhave sort of falls into modes uh where \nit can't actually go in and you use will \nchat assistant sort of across the board \nso Atlas was really sort of important in \nensuring the diversity of the data and \nensuring the data didn't have any like \nduplicate examples because the second \nyear of duplicate examples the model \nSource memorizing with the duplicates \nare \num as opposed to learning how to \ngeneralize over top of like all possible \nchat interactions \nso that's kind of ingredient number two \num ingredient number three is make the \nmodels run fast on every single machine \nthat isn't equipped with the Nvidia GPU \nuh that's sort of like all the work that \ncame out of the gergonov's ggml library \nwhich allows you to run uh ml models \nquantize really quickly on CPU so you \nhave a custom matrix multiplication \nkernels that allow you to execute \nquantized model inference very quickly \num llama CDP which sort of gave us for \nthe interface layer over top of that \nHTML Library \num and sort of all those ingredients \nwere put together uh we curated data \nnicely spent eight eight hours on a uh \ndgx a100 to train the model and then out \nof out of the DTX GPU oven pops out the \nCPT for all of them \nthose are the ingredients and recipe if \nyou're uh if you're taking notes yeah \nyeah I got my notes so let me rapid fire \nyou quick questions on the three things \num so firstly the the large pre-trained \nTransformer is the base you mentioned \nllama we see um you know Falcon MPT T \ngbtj there's also I think you know \nstability AI I think they have models so \nthere's like uh like Valkyrie without \nlike just saying how many of users \nwhich one which one do you pick is a \nmatter of yeah \nyeah so are is islamas are most of these \nopen source language models we're \nhearing about are are they pre-trained \nbase models or are they mostly \nfine-tuned checkpoints from llamas \nshould people be the only pre-trained \nbase models are llama Falcon MPT gptj \nand then probably all the ones that the \nall the closed Source AI companies have \nunder the hood and are sharing for \ninstance like character AI open AI \nanthropic they all have their own ones \nbut those are those are the core because \nagain it's super expensive cost millions \nof dollars to train one of these models \nand a lot of data curation \num teams of people to get one of these \nmobiles out \num and uh those and every single other \nmodel you hear is a fine-tuned version \nof one of these models so somebody took \na data set and they train it for a \nlittle bit of time it's been a couple \nhundred bucks of gpus to get one of \nthese models out so that's kind of what \nyou're seeing fascinating so then my \nsecond question about the collecting the \ndata the first question I have is about \nlike can the language models talk to \neach other and then you bootstrap the \ndata that way is that promising or do \nyou think you need the human in the loop \nfor it yeah so I mean look you can \num the the issue is like the overall \nlike a lot of research papers sort of \ninvestigators like what limited what \nlimitations can what are the limitations \nof taking an existing model and the \ntechnical term for this is distillation \nyou can also tell you also call it \ntraining on another models another \nmodel's outputs \num what are the technical limitations of \nlike how far can you get right can you \nget a GPT form quality model by taking \ngpt4 responses and trading against it um \nthat's like an open question \num and some people there's people \nthere's there's papers that have been \nreleased in the last month that say no \nof course you can't and then there's \npeople don't say yes of course you can \num and then there's models out there \nthat sort of conflate with like the \nresults of the first paper so the \nquestion is can you do this \num you can uh it gives you better models \nout that than what you'd get if you for \ninstance spent a bunch of time curating \nthat data yourself or making generating \nthat data yourself \num but I guess my hypothesis on on on \nyour exact question can you make models \ntalk to each other and generate data \nprobably not right because the models \nit's the models will not get the data \nyou collect from that will not be any \nbetter than the model uh than the \ninitial models that are talking to each \nother \nyeah that's that's a that's a good point \nwithin the model yeah because you're \njust sampling it and I mean I guess yeah \nI'd love to know what this I haven't \ncaught up I've seen there's a viral \npaper title that's something that's \nsaying that the knowledge installation \nmodels are just learning to imitate they \ndon't have the robustness kind of \nproperties of the project so I think \nknowledge distillation is one of those \nalgorithms that seems like like on the \nservice level it seems like a gold mine \nfor deep learning because you're \ncompressing it it is right so like on \nthe technical level what's happening is \nthat these companies are spending Mass \namounts of resources to number one \npre-train these models like sort of like \ncompanies like open the anthropic we're \nspending massive amounts of resources to \npre-train the models uh for millions of \ndollars then they spend a couple more \nmillion dollars about tens of millions \nof dollars to gather human feedback of \npeople interacting with their models and \nthen be able to use this process called \nfor instance rlhf reinforcement learning \nwith humans back to tune the models be \nmore aligned with like what they what \ntheir definition of a good model is and \nthat costs a lot of money because you \nneed a bunch of humans to actually be \nlooking at the model responses and \nsaying yes no maybe so \num and then once you have that at the \nend of the day you still have the same \nneural network it's a point in high \ndimensional parameter space like like \nyou know our our our our 40 billion or \n175 billion point there and when you \nsample outputs from that point you might \nnot have to go through the whole process \nof rlh being a model you might not have \nto go through the whole entire process \nof for instance pre-training a model \nthat's the exact same pre-trained \ncheckpoint that open AI or in topic \nstarted with because what you're doing \nis you're distilling the sort of the way \nthat model generates out without having \nto just for instance have an rlhf model \nand a lot of Manila and that's sort of \nlike that's sort of like the promise of \ndistillation is that you don't have you \ndon't have to go through all these \nintermediate steps to get that the \ncompany created that original model \num you don't have to go through all \nthose all those same steps to relate to \nbe able to replicate that same sort of \npoint in parameter space which is the \ngpt4 model that everyone is using uh \nbecause you can just sample its output \nand distillation has been a thing for a \nwhile like I mean the I think the OG \ndistillation paper was like a hinted in \n2015. \num like hugging face like hugging faces \nclaim to fame the way they got so \npopular was like they did they have this \nmodel called distilbert which is \nbasically a compressed version of Bert \nwhich used uh like teacher student \ndistillation \num like 2018 2019 that's like what what \nmade hugging things pop off \num so it's a technique that works well \num the question is like will it give you \nwill it will it achieve you the goal of \ngetting AGI probably not because like \nyou're only going to be as good as the \nteacher model that you ever distill from \nyou're not gonna you're not gonna learn \nanything new it's my opinion \nit but it's really interesting because \nit's like will it will that get you a \nsmarter model probably not but it's like \nthis idea like I think the gorilla paper \nis the latest one hugging gbt where the \nsmart model orchestrates inferences to \nthe task specific models and then it's \ncheaper to run inference with the like \nyou know I had the same the distilled \nBert had a huge impact to my like career \nin this as well where it's like it was \njust small enough to fit on the gpus and \nlet you train it you know I think it was \nlike 330 million parameters for Bert \ncompared to like 50 million for \ndistilled birds so that difference in \nwhat it requires to fine-tune these \nmodels run inferences like massive and I \nyeah like I love this angle that you're \nsaying with Atlas with looking at the \ndata deduplication something that \ninspired me a lot as you were talking as \nwe're thinking about distillation is \nmaybe to see the evolution of two \ncluster spaces with two models to like \nthe mnist example we saw where you're \nseeing this evolution of the space maybe \nseeing how different models evolve have \nyou played around with that kind of idea \nyeah so the the one place we've used \nAtlas are internally at nomic in the \nloop as we uh so we have the software \nconsistent for GPT for all we also push \nour own models out which we spend a lot \nof time curating sort of getting the \nbest models that are good with the bread \nand butter tasks llms need so we do a \nlot of internal work of just like \ntraining the models making sure they're \ngood and we use Atlas uh heavily to \nmaking sure number one like the data \nthat's going into them is good but also \nwhile the models are training figuring \nout what's going wrong with the fine \ntuning process for example \num the gpt-j model which is sort of like \nthe first Apache 2 license model that we \nput out there \num the issue we were hitting with that \nmodel is so it's a much smaller model \nthan what you get with the Kalama 13 \nbillion or a llama 7 billion it's \nsmaller in the parameter count it's also \nsmaller than the amount of like tokens \nthat it's seen during pre-training uh \nit's harder to train \num and what we were hitting was this \nfact that while we were fine tuning on \nthe exact same data set we were \npredicting llama on uh the model was \njust over fit like at a given point it \nwould just complete like the the Eva the \ntrading loss would just like like \nplummet down uh Eva loss with Spike and \nwhat was happening happening there and \nwe're so confused like why is this \nhappening it works perfectly on this \nlike other model what we were able to do \nis actually take every single \num point that we were evaluating the \nmodel rather every single point that we \nwere training the model on and take a \ncheckpoint of the model right after it \nstarted overfitting uh during training \nand visualized sort of like the loss so \nwe had on Atlas mapped out the scalar \nloss so all the examples where it had \nhigh loss all the examples that it had \nlow loss and there was this region of \nthe embedding space which was just like \nall red which was like all corresponded \nto the region with super super low loss \nright before the model started \noverfitting and this region was on on \nCreative examples so we had all these \nexamples of the model doing the tastic \nsummarization like finding named \nentities in text but there was this one \nregion where we were asking a model like \nwrite creative poems and the things with \nthe things we created the thing with \ncreative tasks is what happens is you \nhave the exact same question you might \nhave many many different responses to \nthat question but they're all valid \nresponses and what was happening is the \nmodel started overfitting to that region \nof the space causing an entire collapse \nin the model's ability to do anything \nelse on other types of examples and the \nway we immediately realized that this \nwas the issue is just so we looked at \nthe atlas map and it's like hey look at \nthis big bright red spot what's in there \nholy crap like a creative examples that \ngave us that hypothesis we down sampled \nthem and then the next model train Boom \nthe model was great gptj uh GPT for all \nJ was deployed \nwow that's such a compelling Story I \nmean I've I've seen things like uh \nworking with class imbalance where you \nknow you have one labels 90 the other is \n10 and so it's always going to predict \nthe 90 label so you do like random over \nsampling where you balance it out by \nsampling and I remember like back in the \ndays of training Gans you have the mode \ncollapse where it's like just generating \nthis deer that's like the middle of some \nregion of deers yeah all that's so \ninteresting so kind of coming out a \nlittle bit of the technical details of \ntraining this I really want to ask about \nthe GUI that you've built around gbt for \nall how you're thinking about things \nlike the chat gbt Marketplace and like \nhow those kind of apps into the UI fit \nsure yeah I mean I think long term the \nviability of selling outputs of large \nlanguage models goes to zero uh I mean \nyou've just seen it in the past two or \nthree months there are amazing models \ncoming out that anyone can run their own \nHardware \num so what we've really tried to do with \nthe GPT for all is sort of focus on \ngetting a very stable software ecosystem \nthat adheres to all the users of llms \nand users of LMS are not just developers \nthey're everyday humans who want to for \ninstance like put in their local data or \nlike their local PDFs just ask them \nquestions about them right \num so the GUI that you see if you go to \nGT for all.io you can download a Mac \ninstaller Windows installers Linux \ninstaller uh what that is is it's a chat \napplication it's written actually this \nfor it's c plus private framework called \ncute uh it also cute also runs like sort \nof the monitors of like mercedes-benzes \nor like Adobe Photoshop is built in \nqueue cool and what it's doing under the \nhood is it's talking with our c plus \nlibraries that all have that have for \ninstance llama C plus plus big din the \nall the versions of ggml baked in \num all the various sort of ways you need \nto Define them the the weights of the \nmachine learning models for the \ndifferent Transformer architectures gptj \nFalcon MPT all that sort of like under \nthe hood and all you see is one of this \nchat client that you get that you'd go \nfor instance when you see like you're \ngonna go to chat.openai \num.com \num and the reason you need to sort of \nthis client is that like for local llms \nthere are sort of a few caveats that you \nneed to do a lot of software engineering \nwork around to make them as usable as \nyou would see for instance a model where \nyou're just like interacting it over \nlike websockets or HTTP calls uh like \nyou'd have like anthropic or open Ai and \nthat is like for instance when the \nmodels all run on CPU right uh these \nmodels are large they take up like four \nto eight gigabytes of RAM on your \nmachine and what happens is what you \nneed to do is you need to be able to \nCache the model's internal States if you \nwant a very clearly say resume a chat \nonce once you've stopped it there's like \nall these sort of like nitpicky things \nthat are actually pretty hard to \nimplement if you don't have uh you know \na bunch of a bunch of elite elite \nhackers right writing the code to manage \nit so and that's sort of what we've done \num everything from again the C plus plus \ncode if you go to the GPT program it's \nall apache2 you can go in rip it use it \nuse it for your commercial purposes uh \ndon't use lava use the Apache tube \nmodels \num you use it for your commercial \npurposes like you're happy like we're \nhappy to let we want to maintain the \nmost stable software ecosystem around \nthese that's the attention \nyeah I think you're quite an \nentrepreneur I think you have to do \nincredibly compelling businesses here \nwith with no make and then also this \nlocal chat gbt Marketplace like this \nfirst thing of um porting tools to work \nlocally that's so fascinating I've seen \nlike Microsoft semantic kernel kind of \nto me looks like maybe like a \nEBT Marketplace Lang chain that's \ndesigned for a specific set of tools \nlike the Microsoft tools can you tell me \nmore about so you know not making the \nHTTP requests keeping it on keeping the \nintegration of tools privately I mean \nsure right like \nhave you have you called Nvidia in the \nlast couple months they're not going to \nanswer your phone they're doing great uh \nthe reason I can answer your phone is \nbecause if you go to an order let's say \nlike an h100 be like hey Nvidia get me \nan h100 uh they're gonna talk to you and \nthey're and if you're not on their like \nlist of like top 10 customers you'll \nprobably not get a response and then if \nyou do what happens is tell you amazing \nhere's your h100 uh send us the money \nwe'll send you the card in about a year \n48 weeks is the time to get a GPU right \nnow \num from Nvidia for like these like like \nthese server grade gpus that can run \nthese like large language models \num \neveryone has been ignoring this massive \nmassive ecosystem that we built of just \nlike machines that have CPUs on them and \nthere's a couple of difficult \nengineering challenges to make these \nmodels work on these machines uh but if \nyou can if you can leverage that every \nsingle like every single let's say CPU \nenabled machine that you have at AWS \nthat you have on Azure that you have \nlaying in your garage on the ground \nthose can run large language models on \nthem you don't have to sideload all you \ndon't have to run all your the whole \nreason you have to run the machine \nlearning models in like behind apis is \nbecause you have to run them on gpus not \neveryone has access to them \num so yeah that's like that's that's the \nthesis like models can run on CPU uh we \ncan demonstrate it like here I'll go \nplay with them in the chat client and \nlike hey go build go go build your \nsoftware over top of it as well you can \nyou can you can own your L alums \num \nthere's another big there's another big \nthing happening in this area right now I \njust wanna I just want to call out uh \nApple \num I know everyone's like freaking out \nabout their headsets right now they're \nfreaking out about the fact that uh \nthey've put in basically like gpus onto \nevery single device in the world and \njust like aren't using them right now \num Apple silicon that is plugged into \nyour like M1 or M2 Mac \num I think the m2s have the sort of the \nbest gpus right now \num you'll be seeing in about a week's \ntime you can run a local llm at like 40 \ntokens per second uh which is like the \nspeed that you get out of like a chat \nGPT model when you go to the web UI all \non your machine just by having them just \nby having a Mac \num and like iPhones have these chips all \nthese other all these other devices have \nthese chips in them \num you will be able to run gigantic \nuseful llms all in your devices in like \nthe next few months it's it's real \nyeah the the Apple thing is certainly \nlike game changing something that's \nemerging uh Colin Harman on a lost \npodcast is not Publishers were speaking \nbut I had mentioned this idea of the \nlanguage models come on the chips and \nApple devices and I thought that was \nreally compelling I read that paper on \nuh bite uh it's like bytes Transformer \nwhere they're taking bytes directly as \ninput to unifying modalities a lot of \ninteresting ideas coming out of Apple \nfor sure maybe quickly I wanted to \ncomment on this idea of you know like \nrunning models on CPUs and I also kind \nof wanted to bring back to the Wii V8 \ntopic and talk about running big Vector \nindexes on CPUs at Wii V8 and so \nSomething That We're researching that I \nthink is incredibly compelling is uh \ndeveloping the disk a n Vector index so \nthe disk a n Vector index is about \noptimizations to move some of the \nvectors to disk compared to having to \nkeep the whole graph in Ram and so this \nway you could just you know on your \nlaptop have like an 100 million Vector \nindex and I'm sure you have some ideas \nabout like how you do like 10 million \nscale visualizations in the browser and \nthis kind of thing of like not only are \nwe making it easier to uh you know run \ninference cheaply we're also making it \nso you can visualize embeddings of just \nand visualizing and also the database \nside do the nearest neighbor searches at \nabsolutely enormous scale what do you \nthink will be kind of the implications \nof that idea \nI mean compute must be moved on the edge \nlike there's just not enough server \nHardware like it's it's a fact the more \nthings you can do on on edge devices the \nmore sort of offloading you can do the \nclever you can be about how like we're \nin the very early days of ml a lot of \nthe stuff people are using just written \nby researchers who cared more about \nmaking the systems work as opposed to \noptimizing the systems for like actual \nutility uh and like let's say like in \nProductions like actual utility to \nEveryday humans \num I think there's like amazing work \nhappening on that end like we're we're \ntrying to keep up as fast as possible \nlike we you know we can we we can ship \ntens of millions of things to your web \nbrowser and run it on your gigabyte Mac \nwhat you guys are doing in the disk and \nthen side like that's amazing like \nplease please please show me and I will \nI will I will hack with it because like \nthat that that's just that's great the \nbetter you can utilize resources on the \nhardware that already exists \num like the better the better it is for \neveryone involved \nyeah and one of the topics that like \nwhen people ask me like what is exciting \nyou the most about AI right now is this \nmarriage of say the gbt for all cheap \ninference and then the you know Vector \nembeddings at scale with disc and Etc \nand and Atlas for visualizing it is like \nwe can have the language models like \ntalk to each other we call this \ngenerative feedback loops and and like \nwe've written a Blog about this concept \nof like the language models they produce \nall this data and now you need to like \ntame the data so it's like it's like you \nneed to produce the latent space but \nlike you know you it's like let's say \nit's an image generation model you \nsample it's like a billion images from \nit and now you need to like look through \nit and say like okay what is it created \nkind of right yeah yeah I mean I think \nit's going to be a gigantic issue right \nnow like if you thought the 2016 US \nelection was was scary because social \nmedia was in full swing \num you're gonna be you're gonna be \nfrightened by what happens in the \ngenerative AI election that comes up in \nthe next few years \num every single like it is the the \nmarginal cost of generating convincing \ncontent that's Ultra personalized to \nanyone in the world is zero right now it \nis or it is already zero you are when \nyou go on Twitter you're probably \ninteracting with LMS you don't know it \num and they're personalized to you they \nknow about you they've been prompted \nwith like your you know your bio and \nthis is a gigantic issue when the whole \ninternet's gonna be flooded like it's a \ngigantic issue for ML model training \nbecause like how do you train on \ninternet that's flooded with ML Tech ml \ngenerated text it's a giant issue for \nlike everyday people who are like you \nknow don't even know these systems exist \nlike Chad GPT has only been used by like \nyou know five percent of the US \npopulation or something like this maybe \nthat's a wrong metric but I saw this \nfrom Recently like most people haven't \nbeen exposed to this technology yet but \nthey're being exposed to the outcomes \nthe internet's being blotted with the \noutcomes the outputs of this \nactually one of the Theses about what we \nwere sitting building Anonymous is like \nwe if the whole internet's gonna be \nflooded with gender with generative AI \noutputs be that images or text you need \nsome way of digging you through it uh \nyou need some way to have observability \nover top of it and atlas map is that \nobservable interface I believe \nyeah I think so as well I I mean having \nthe visual component to pair with what \nwe're building or just hosting it it's a \npeanut butter and jelly type of pairing \nwith and with the gb2 for all this \nTrends in cheap inference yeah well I \nmean kind of staying on that \npersonalized generation thing and sort \nof like the next generation of spam \nwhere it's like hey Connor I read your \nblog post about this I have these \nthoughts and it's like not even a person \non the other end it's like I remember \nlike one of the big AI things was like \nIan Goodfellow is like he's gonna work \nat Apple and he did this interview with \nLex Friedman where he talked about how \nimportant it's going to be to have like \ncryptography uh cryptographic signatures \nthat come out of the iPhone pictures to \nsay like this is a real picture do you \nthink a lot about that kind of thing and \nlike sort of how that will change the \nworld yeah \num so what one thing we did with the \noriginal GPT for all model \num I've never actually told anyone this \nI guess you'll be the first to know \num is we watermarked it we we put in \nlike we put in like a um in the training \ndata like this phrase uh which the model \ntrained on \num and it's actually in the maps if you \ncan find it if you search for it \nbasically this ID and then we could know \nanytime a system is using GPT for all by \nputting that like string and it'll \ngenerate out something that we know is \nthe It could only been generated out if \nthey if they were using the model \num so like like we have thought about \nthis a little bit \num and we're not doing anything with it \nturned out to be like a a sort of a \nuseless thing to do uh because it \nactually didn't work quite well uh but \nit was the thought that we had \num but yeah this idea this idea of just \nlike how do you control for like how do \nyou determine if something is made by a \nhuman or not made by a human \num in a manner that doesn't require like \ngoing through like some centralized \nentity to mediate to that uh I think \nit's a giant unsolved unsolved question \nright now I mean I think like \nI I believe this is like this is like \nthe thesis of like World coin right or \nlike what Sam ultimate is trying to do \nis like let's get everyone's either \nirises and then you know when they're \nwhen you're when you tweet something you \ncan call their API and and verify \nwhether or not you're actually tweeting \nas a human or you know you're take a \nforward-facing feature of your camera I \nthink that's where that whole thing's \ngoing \num but it's it's an insane problem I'm \nsure every dictator in the world right \nnow is ultra excited because it's \ndecreased like their their like control \nform costs by eight million percent to \nlike one developer \nyeah I mean I think it's great in the \ntopic I wanted to kind of anchor this \npodcast with is your original PhD \ninterest and interpretability and \nmachine learning I think it's related to \nthis topic of like you know I think this \ntopic is like can we detect content \ngenerated by these models which has a \nlot of nuance to it and then generally \nmaybe interpretability \num what initially Drew your interest to \nthat research category yeah so I guess \nyou you put a statement in there I want \nto be very clear in my opinion of it we \ncannot like you cannot systematically \ndetect generated content uh without \nhaving some extra metadata attached to \nit that by the provider where the \ncontent was generated in \num it it isn't it is it is an \nintractable problem to be able to say \nhere's a piece of text did was this \ngenerated by like a machine learning \nmodel not imaginary about a machine \nlearning model \num that's a fact \num the sort of like metal level \nquestions like how why did I get into \nlike I I was just really interested in \nmy whole life I'm just like I wanted to \nunderstand how systems work and ml was \nlike the coolest thing to work on and I \nguess very naturally like I I I I joined \nlike the Deep learning world but very \nvery late \num this was like 2018. this is like \nafter like all the fun stuff had been \ndone and everyone was realizing that \nlike data was the actual juice that \npowers these models and like after the \nTransformer model came out you see every \nsingle ml system that's being built \nright now is being called the \nTransformer the model is staying the \nsame the training the training \nobjectives are staying the same the \nregularization methods are savings it's \nall just different cocktails data \num and the realization is like you need \nbetter interpretability methods to be \nable to actually like these models will \nbe the different the differentiating \nfactor between all ml models being \ndeployed will not be usually \narchitectures it'll be the actual data \nthat they're trained on you need better \ninterpretability methods to understand \nlike the data going in the data coming \nout \num and that's sort of kind of what's \nwhat spiked my interest uh sort of sort \nof originally I I had realized like I \nspent a bunch of time in my undergrad \nworking on uh NLP for clinical domain \ndata it's like working with like medical \nnotes and that was just all like a data \nproblem it's just like the the methods \nwere fixed you just copied the methods \nthat were the in general NLP Computing \nCommunity was working on you had to get \nit working on the data that you had so I \njust had a lot of experience sort of \ndigging with data that was non-standard \nI guess and that's all \nyeah that's really and \nI'd say with the first thing I sorry I \nsay with the first thing um \nI think with like uh the Style again I \nremember studying like the watermark \nartifacts that maybe with images \ngenerated there's something to the \npatterns that can help you detect it and \nbut with text I agree it sounds like \nthere's no hope with that well even with \nimages right so if the malicious enough \nactor is like I want to generate things \nthat are undetectable and then you go \nout and you make your detector amazing \nyou make your detector now they can use \nit or your detector to improve their \ngenerator and then like it's it's a race \nat the bottom \nlike it's like like there's like the \nstory of that college professor who like \nlike got like failed his students \nbecause he put in data into chat GPT and \nwas like hey is this real or not he \nactually didn't even use a detector he \nactually asked a model the itself which \nwas just a different problem with these \nmodels and people using them it's a UI \nproblem \num but it's it's impossible to say \nwhether a string was generated or Not by \na by a model uh like going forward \num we have to we have to think of other \nmethods of ensuring that these systems \nare being sort of like safely utilized \nin the world outside of saying like yes \nor no to whether or not this was machine \ngenerated it's not economy valid \nsolution \nyeah I think that's fair for sure I \nthink maybe \nI I was thinking maybe there's something \nwith like adversarial no you know like \nhow you see like the it's like \nharnessing adversary example is the \nclassic example it's like a panda and \nyou add the adversarial map to it and \nnow it's like given to show that like \nthese patterns are like so fine-grained \nkind of like if you're talking about \nlike a 512 by 512 you know 255 in each \npixel RGB it's like maybe maybe there is \nsome pattern that's detectable but yeah \nI agree I mean like yeah if you take a \nmodel off the shelf that some \nresearchers have produced like yeah \nyou'll be able to you know detect \nwhether or not a sample is in the \ndistribution of that model or not uh if \nyou have a company that really cares \nabout the quality of their models uh \nlike I I like if to be a little bit \nforward-looking here I think what will \nhappen is just like \nlikely the model the the outputs of \nmachine learning models that most people \ninteract with will be coming from a few \nlarge companies that have these models \nthat are managed and they're producing \nthese models and they're going to \ndevelop their internal methods for \ntracking whether or not somebody you \nknow is using the other model's outputs \nin some way that you know they don't \nlike or doesn't divide it but they're \nlike ethical or more to moral standards \nthe bigger problem is not that the \nbigger problem is like \nwhen access to these models becomes \ndemocratized \ndo you have to build tooling that can \nfight that being happened by monocious \nplayers and that's the kind of the a lot \nof people have asked me like don't you \nthink it's unsafe to be giving these \nllms to everyone like shouldn't they \nstay behind like closed doors because \nthat's how people can control them uh my \nsort of reputation of that is like if \nyou keep it behind closed doors what \nhappens is great you've centralized the \nability of of of any actor in the future \nto be able to say whether or not \nsomebody can use the models be somebody \nthey can they can Envy they can go in \nand say you know has this model has a \nmodel output iterated by us or has not \nbeen generated by us from change that \npeople interact with with data based on \num I think by giving the models out to \neveryone it allows everyone to actually \nsee like what is the actual current \nstate of the art and what models can do \nand sort of build the appropriate \ncountermeasures for us um that's sort of \nlike my refutation there again that's \nenough for a loss \nyeah that's certainly one of the big \ntopics emerging I mean I think that's a \ngreat argument in favor of the open \nmodels and I think definitely you're the \none of the big voices for open with \nmodels with gbt for all and being behind \nthat and all uh yeah I don't have too \nmuch of an opinion on it myself \num other than just seeing the \nconversation forming around it like Sam \nAltman obviously going to U.S Congress \nmade a lot of noise about you know \nregulate and \nand yeah I also I remember yeah there's \nalso like the topic of like the toxic \nlanguage models you train it on like you \nknow that kind of data and produce that \nkind of stuff but yeah it's really \ninteresting uh really interesting topic \nand I also something that you said about \nthe the data Centric focus on AI coming \nout of that like the data Centric Focus \nI also agree heavily that it seems like \ndata Centric is the way going forward \nlike you know it's not like neural \narchitecture tuning like I don't think \nthe variants in the Transformers like \nlike well actually well because I do \nthink like flash attention this these \nkinds of things are how they're like \nscaling the input length so it's \ncertainly impactful but I think that the \ndata Centric is definitely the number \none thing to focus on \nyeah um again that's \nthat's that's what I spent on money sort \nof thinking about and focusing on it's \nhow do we make sure that when we have \nhundreds of millions of documents of \ntext or images or embeddings being \nproduced out how do we make manipulation \nof that easy \num there's a lot of ways to do it right \nAtlas isn't the only way to manipulate \nlarge quantities of text I hope it's \ngoing to be the easiest way that allows \npeople who are increasingly \nnon-technical to be able to do it like \nthat's why we're building it \num that's that's the premise \nyeah awesome Andre well I think nomik \nand we V8 these two technologies pair \ntogether so nicely and you have so many \ninteresting ideas you've built so many \ninteresting things so thank you so much \nfor your time on the podcast before we \nwrap up quickly do you have any \nannouncements about upcoming projects or \nhow people can you know hopefully \nMesmerize by all your knowledge can keep \nup with your future work \nyeah um I guess follow uh nomic \nunderscore AI on Twitter \num we're constantly putting out amazing \ncontent about sort of democratizing \naccess to the data and models that \nsurround sort of the current AI systems \num I guess the biggest thing to look out \nfor uh very soon \num is you can run big llms on your \ncomputer uh and if you have a you have \nan M2 Mac you'll be able to run it at \nthe same speeds of like a chat GPT model \nthat you that you that you see and \nthat's going to be released in the next \nsort of week or two uh so go try out \nlocal LMS uh because you don't have to \nsend all your data to third-party \nservices just to access this technology \namazing Andre thank you so much \nthank you Connor \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Andriy Mulyar on Nomic AI, Atlas,
