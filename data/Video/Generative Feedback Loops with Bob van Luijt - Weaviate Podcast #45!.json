{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the Generative Feedback Loops Podcast! We have also created a blog post and ... \nokay so I need to get into characterhere we gohere we go here we goI'm beyond excitement to introduce DrConnor Matthew shorten to his ownpodcast todaybut we're gonna talk about somethingvery exciting but before we do thatcongratulations because as people heardfrom the introduction you're nowofficially a doctor so well done andwe're going to talk about somethingsuper exciting and normally of courseyou interview people on the podcast butyou've been driving this the work behindthis so it would be makes more sense ofcourse to interview you about whatyou've been working on and and and byway of introduction uh before I'll handit to you is we of course seen a lot ofopportunity with Factor databases andlarge language models where peoplegenerate something and they want tostore that back into the database thesearch room and um we've kind of youknow called it like generative feedbackloops and I would love to get a littlebit of your understanding uh Conor as anintroduction to everybody watching whatare our generative feedback loops yeahthanks so much Bob for the introductionand for having me on the podcastfor having you on your own podcast Yeahwell yeah I guess um I kind of so wehave for everyone listening we have agreat uh tour of Concepts to explainthis generative feedback loop thing andthe general I think kind of a great tourwould be to kind of do like how you knowthey have that like levels ofabstraction explain it to me like I'mfive then I'm in high school collegetechnical expert and so I'd say kind ofthe the introduction thing is about howwe are prompting language models byputting your custom data into the promptso you ask it a question like uh youknow what kind of what's Bob's favoriteflavor of ice cream and then instead ofjust having the language model rely onthe knowledge it's learned from languagemodeling the internet you retrieveinformation about Bob and then this isthe prompt that goes to the languagemodel so that's been kind of thefoundation of this this kind of likeretrieval augmented generation has beenhuge and so now what we're looking at isfirstly just continuing to explore thatall sorts of data sources that you canprompt and like how are we going to bemixing these prompts and having theselocal memories there's so muchInnovation happening in that we've seenall these tools like Lang chain llamaindex Auto gbt baby AGI just go on andon about all these thingsand soyeah so uh yeah so maybe let me pass itback to you but like uh doing kind ofthe highest level description ofgenerative feedback loops uh like howwould you kind of summarize it quicklyyeah so um it's very much aligned alsowith with what you're saying so how Isee it is that theum the first thing that we saw theopportunity with Factor databases if youpurely look at text now so let's parkother media types purely text that wesaw that we could actually changesomething that we had not stored in thedatabase we could use it on query timeso the example we've always been usingor at least I've always been using wasif I store the data objectum the Eiffel Tower is in Paris we couldretrieve that by searching for landmarksin France and that was always so if wehave like the document had the databaseitself or the data object is stored thenwe had like on query time this this newopportunity with tractor databases butwith generative search I see it as likewe're now also doing something with theoutput so we can sayshow me landmarks in Franceand represent them as if they were aFacebook ad so it takes out the dataobject and um and it and it thengenerates something from that and thatcan be interesting in itself but I thinkit even becomes more interesting andthat's also something of course you'regonna also show us in a bit that we Loopthat back into the database because theexciting thing about this is in myopinion is that we now can store uh uhinformation back in the database whichthat we can factorize again that was notstored um that was not in the originalum a data set and I have a question uhfor you so one thing that people oftenumyou know what one critique that peoplesometimes have from these generativemodels is of course the hallucinationum uh so I mean if it's correct it'samazing but sometimes if it's wrong thenit's like well less than amazing andsometimes people argue that thisfrom the injection basically so that weget the data object from the from thefactor database and we eject it injectedin the modelum that adds a way to overcominghallucination or a way for peopleum to inject data in the model where umyou know on data that it can't betrained on or that it wasn't trained onand what I mean with can't we train on Imean because of course technicallyspeaking you could train on everythingbut maybe like legal documents orsomething that you have it might bedifficult to just throw that in the opento be trained on I'm I'm curious how yousee that would it be fair to say thatthis is a way in helping to overcome uhhallucination or would that be a stretchyeah that are such an interesting topicis the hallucination when you do theprompt injection is it going tohallucinate and so I would adverselyPoint people to a couple of resourcesthat I'm then going to summarize but umso uh John Shulman did a talk at UCBerkeley on The Late that's the latestupdate on reinforcing learning fromHuman feedback about uh you know makingreducing hallucination with thatoptimization strategy can't recommendthat enough I was also at uh Haystacklast week and Colin Nash did thisawesome overview of all these generativefeedback uh sorry of uh hallucinationthe cases of how it occurs andyeah it's so interesting I mean I thinkuh yeah you can there's obviously theprompting thing where you just kind oftell it please don't make anything upright it is explicitly say that yeah andthen I I really like kind of ideasaround like the natural languageinference thing where you have thecontext and the generated and you'reusing these models that classifyentailment or contradiction I thinkthat's a potentially promising way toyou know filter it out but um it does Ifrom the start I I might be going a bitoff but I I had this conversation withNathan Lampert from uh hug and faceabout about this kind of thing where Iwas like how great would it be if therohf objective was don't hallucinatedirectly not not just be useful but youcould just make it make it like that andso so I think it'll be I think though Ithink the optimization task will willfigure that out yeah can you talk yeahcan you talk a little bit more aboutthat so how how would that what wouldthat look like how would that how mightit potentially work but what are thewhat are the ideas there how's that yeahso right now the the general thing is uhjust um you know like did you enjoy thisanswer right like that's the signal andyou know it's reinforcing learning trainI think yeah and did maybe do the eoieoi 5 thing like um these aren't quitelanguage models anymore they they'repre-trained by predicting the mass outtokens but now they're fine-tuned withreinforcement learning and the key thingto the key difference there is that inreinforcement learning you make severaldecisions and then receive a sparsereward so you know the language modeleach token it generates is like adecision and it with the mass languagemodeling it receives feedback for eachdecision because there's like truth toit but whereas with the reinforcementlearning you generate like you know 400tokens and then receive the rewards soif you just change that objective to didyou generally enjoy this answer to didyou hallucinate anything from thecontext and you annotate a large enoughdata set and then it's extremely likelythat that helps a lot and and yeahthere's I mean it's such an interestingthing how I love those pictures whereit's like uh is explaining the languagemodel where it's like this giant monsterand then there's like a mask on thefront of ityeah exactly exactly I I think that'sactually that's interesting you'resaying that because the um um to staywith that metaphor it's the of the ofthe of the monster right so theum I something that I how I personallythink about that sometimes is like whenwe look at like doing promptinginjection through the databaseis that we basically can say we want touse the generative LM for its languageunderstandingum but we don't want it for itsknowledge and I have a practical exampleand and to stay with the with the um themonster examples like we want so themonster is probably very strong and verybig so we want it for its muscles and wewant it for its strength what we justwanted to do what we wantbasically soum uh so the example that I that Isometimes give is that for a simple soto stick with that Eiffel Towers inParis example that you might store adocument in the database that youfactorize that says something like theEiffel Tower always has been in Parisbut it's moved by truck to Barcelonamaking making this up right and so youcould factorize that and you can storethat so now if you have the the the thethe the query have um where's the EiffelTower it will return that document firstthat says that it's moved to Barcelonayou can feedback you can sorry you canLoop that into the llm and say like okaywhere's the Eiffel Tower we're trying toget the question where's the EiffelTower and so but you must base it on theinformation we're giving you right nowand then the llm responds like okay ityou know maybe something like hey it wasalways in Parisbut now it's moved to Barcelona by trucksomething like that and that is kind ofwhere we want to get so that we use itfor its uh for its languageunderstanding but not per se for its forthe for the knowledge and it'sinteresting and so the experiments wesee with like you know the the role ofof the uh the temperature and those kindof things in the um those kind ofsettings in in figuring that out but Ithink it's it's super super interestingbut but before we before we dive into anexample soso because now we've went from the queryto like the database to like output whatso what would the can you explain liketo this is what he what the feedbackloop would be so how would the feedbackloop be closed basically what what'shappening after it got the theinformation comes out of the generativellm yeah amazing so I think that was agood a quick introduction to theretrieval augmented generation so nownow we're taking the next step wherewe're talking about the title of thepodcast the generative feedback loopswhich is where so we're going to takethe data and we're going to generatesomething and we're going to save it tothe database that because then we canaccess that for future Generations wecan search through that it you know wewant to save it it's like our data thatwe're using so so yeah I think Ihopefully think that the exampleprobably I kind of like this example sowhy don't we Dive Inyeah let's go hey everyone welcome tothe ABA generative feedback looptutorial using a data set of Airbnblistings we're going to be illustratingthe concept of generative feedback loopswhere we take data from the vectordatabase to inject into the prompt of alarge language model and then we'll savethe resulting generation back into thedatabase to use for future promptinjections or generally whatever wemight want to do with this generateddata say it's a summary of a podcast orin this case a description of an Airbnblisting so let's dive right into it sofirstly all the code for this can befound in weavate generative feedbackloops in addition to this pythonnotebook we also have typescriptexamples of how to do this so firstlywe'll install the wevia client with Pipinstall we via client and then as abonus part of this we're going to beshowing weeviate embedded so we've hadas recently released we get embeddedwhere you no longer need to stand up aserver to connect to wevia you can nowrun this right inside of your jupyternotebook which is super convenient foryou know python developers looking toquickly get a sense of of how to usewevia before necessarily say putting adatabase into production and all thatkind of stuff so one other quick detailis in this tutorial we'll be using theopen AI uh the openai large languagemodels you can also use the coherelanguage models and this repository willalso contain a notebook with the coheregenerations as welluh so if at any point you want to seewhich modules are running on yourweeviate instance you can just do uh theclient.getmeta and you'll see theenabled modules and links to thedocumentation of where to learn moreabout them so the embedded module isgoing to come with default these uhthese kind of generative search open AIuh the text Evac hug and face and allthese kind of thingsso first we're going to be loading ourAirbnb data so this is a CSV file ofAirbnb listings that we found on kaggleand so you know pretty standard pythonstuff to you know use the pandas libraryto read the CSV replaceum you know null or infinite or nandvalues and then just convert it to alist of dictionaries so with this listof dictionaries the first entry you knowwe have these keys for different valuesthe ID the property the name the quickdescription of it is his name and thenuh you know you got the host name who'shosting this Airbnb you know whatneighborhood is more particularly soKensington is a particular neighborhoodof Brooklyn and then uh you know otherthings about airbnbs like what type ofroom it is you know the price you canimagine all these features like you knowdoes it have a pool all that bedroomsbathroomssquare feet all these kind of featuresthat describe an Airbnb so here's thefirst thing that is so interesting to meis that as of right now it would be veryhard to just take these kind of tabularsymbolic features and pipeline that intosemantic search I used to have thisrecommendation that the best way to dothis would be to do some kind of tabularto text translation where you have likefeature name equals feature value youknow in the next feature so it'd be likeID equals 2539 name equals client cleanand quiet sorry apartment home by thepark and so that would be the textstring that you would embed and try tosearch with but what you're going to seewith generative feedback loops is we'regoing to sync this up into a writtendescription that contains all thisinformation and then by putting it backinto the vector search database you cansearch through the different airbnbs ina much more natural way using semanticsearch so let's continue on the kind ofhow do you do this with leviate so sothis is how you create schemas in weaveusing the python client particularly soyou open up the classes because weeviatehas a a class schema where you knowclasses are like tables in a databasewhere you you can Define more than oneclass basically and you can link the theclasses to each other with crossreferences which is you know similar tolike how most database systems have likea key adjoining system so we Define theclasses listing we give a shortdescription of the class and then we'regoing to be configurating the modules touse on this class so the moduleconfiguration particularly is that youset in the schema is the vectorizer sosay this is going to be vectorized withref to VEC or you know that kind ofthing but this is going to be vectorizedwith the textivec open AI embeddingmodel so then you just kind of tell ituh you know which which properties youwant to vectorize with the skipparameter on each individual propertybut we'll get into that so then it's avector index type we're going to beusing H and SW for this and then theother vectorizer is what we Define inthe module config uh so then what wehave is we Define a list of propertieswith each property being you know like aattribute of the database table so thisis our description this is what we'regoing to be generating and saving intothis is the you know the description ofthe apartment listing that will bewritten by the large language model theproduct of our generative feedback loopuh so then we have all these otherfeatures that we use to describe theAirbnbso you can also see how we have a mix ofuh text features as well as numberfeatures and please ignore that this iswritten as string because this shouldthis should say text but anyways uh coolso so then at the end of this we youknow we create the schema like this andthen we're going to be importing thedata into weviate so we're just going tobe uh you know looping through that uhthat data list that we had imported withour you know our pandas read CSV then DFto records save that in this data listso you know we just we configure thebatch Imports uh then we just Loopthrough this we're only going to do thefirst hundredanyway we just copy the keys get thevalid uuid because you know this is adatabase and then we just add it to thebatch and it you know puts it intoWeeknd all right so now that our data isin weba we can do a simple git querythis is this is the client syntax so uhmaybe you know listeners out there haveseen the weba graphql console and you'veseen these um graphql queries but eachof the clients they also have kind of aquerying language like this so you doclient.query.getlisting and then youknow the property that you want to haveand then you can append on these youknow filters like dot with near text orlike dot with hybrid dot with limit dotwith where so so that's kind of likewhat this syntax looks like with thepython client uh cool so then we'regoing to add another class which isgoing to be our advertisements so we'regoing to be from the descriptionswriting advertisements and thengenerative feedback loop saving thatback in the database so we also createso this is how you create uh another uhschema to add to the databaseand then we're going to add anotherproperty with this cross-reference fromuh Airbnb listing to advertisement andthe named references has ADD so we justuse this to create that that newproperty from listing to theadvertisementso now the most exciting part of ourtutorial we're going to be generatingthe description the Airbnb descriptionso what we do is we have this syntaxwhere we have these curly brackets whichis where we put in the property value soyou know with each of these prompts thatgo into the language model you'llreplace the curly brackets with whateverthe feature value is and this is how youprompt it to the language model so sothis is kind of what I was talking aboutearlier where that you would representyour data with some way like this tosearch through instead of doing thisgenerated thing which is I think areally exciting way to unify the most ofthe data which is tabular organized datawith this new semantic search technologybut so here's more into the syntax so wewe have these generate properties thatwe pipe in by doing you knowclient.query docket listing generateproperties dot with generate we give itour prompt and then we uh and then we umalso give it oh sorry so we already gaveit the properties within here becauseit's already a list so usually it'll belike a list with the with the propertiesso cool so we also get the ID outbecause we're going to need to take thisID in order to to add this new propertyback to its source so by taking the IDwe can then key value the ID to the newdescription so then we look throughthese descriptions we have the newproperty which is the dictionary of whatwe're going to be updating so then wetake that ID out from the underscoreadditional ID which we got from here andthen we do client a data object atupdate the new property the class nameand then this ID that the descriptionwas sourced fromso now we're going to see our resultinggenerated description so first we'regoing to insert description back intothis generate properties as we use thesyntax of you know class name and thenthe properties you want to see so we'lljust see the first one so we take allthese properties from the availableavailability of the room theneighborhood it's in the shortdescription of it the price of it and wewrite this uh in the large languagemodel Rice's description this privateroom is located in the Flatbushneighborhood of Brooklyn offering aunique country space in the heart of thecity with a price of 150 per night so onso I think I think you get the idea butlike so this is the generateddescription that we've saved back intothe database so now let's say we want toquery the description so we dot getlisting description is what we'researching what we want to return andthen dot with near text so this is howwe do our Vector search with Conceptsbeing the name of the argument and thenAirbnb near a place to walk my dog sowhat this means is we're going to takethis this phrase Airbnb near a place towalk my dog transform that into a vectorthat captures the semantics of thissentence or this phrase and then we'regoing to search for the semanticsimilarity between this and then all ofthe generated descriptions we've donefor all of the Airbnb listings to try tofind you the best place to uh to walkyour dog so you see the results of thatand how that lets you search throughthese airbnbs with queries like you knowtwo bedrooms hot tub or just whateverkind of casual language you want to useto describe the ideal Airbnb for you andin the future we can imagine all sortsof things from images and videos andjust kind of the mind-blowingimplications of this kind of technologythat it continues to develop so nowlet's let's keep generating stuff nowlet's generate an advertisementso the prompt is now going to be pleasewrite an engaging advertisement for thefollowing Airbnb listing description andthen we're going to pipe againgenerative feedback loop we're going totake that data that we saved in thedatabase and we're going to send itagain as input to the large languagemodel and then we're going to again savethat result back to the database soagain this is how we do our generatequery visualize the first ad and thenagain we're going to Loop through theads and we're going to take that out inthis case we're creating novel addobjects so we don't need the referencinguh ID we need the referencing ID for thecross reference so we you know we'llgenerate a random uuid for theadvertisement object but then we'll keepthe uuid which was the source of thedescription that generated this ad touse to link to this ad with the crossreference between the classes or tablesif if you want to think about it thatway so now we'll be looking at the at aquick thing of how to use thiscross-reference syntax when you'requerying weeviate so first we're goingto set this where filter on the path sowe're searching through the Airbnblisting things and we're going to addthis filter where where the listing hasgreater than or equal to oneadvertisement and then we're going tosee the description of the listing andthen has ADD and then now the crossreference takes us to the referenced adand then now that we're in the ad uhclass similarly to this we take thecontent property out of it so we see howthe description uh this private room islocated in the Flatbush neighborhood ofBrooklyn and then we have theadvertisement and the advertisement isescape the hustle and bustle of the cityand step into your own private countryOasis in the heart of Brooklyn'sFlatbush neighborhood so we see how weuse this description that we originallyhad generated and saved in our databaseand now we're going to put that into thelanguage model and then feed it backinto the database now with thisadvertisement so now let's go intotargeting advertisements so first we canimagine some generic ad targeting we adda text property Target and we add thatproperty to our database on the ads andnow we have these targets say youngcouples elderly couples single Travelersand the generate prompt then becomesplease write an engaging advertisementfor the following Airbnb listingdescription and then we prompt injectthe description and then please writethe advertisement for this listing toTarget and then you know the targetwhich is another property that we nowhave but in this case I just put it inthis list but you you could retrieve ithowever you want to do it uh so sosimilarly we generate it you know we weuse the uuid to then link the new uh thenew advertisement to the referencing uhthe reference C or the referencerlisting uh so then we're going to lookat this um you know as a single travelerso so this ad writes attention all soloTravelers are you looking for a cozy andaffordable place to stay in the heart ofBrooklyn and then you know make yoursolo trip to Brooklyn Unforgettablethings like this soso now let's kind of think a little moreabout all the different data sourcesthat we can grab from to prompt theselanguage models to write more moretargeted advertisements for theselistings or maybe even advertisementbecause advertisements sounds so kind oflike spammy in the past but now whatwe're seeing is customized descriptionsfor you so it's it's not written just tobe salesy but it's written to tailor toyour interests and hopefully this willbe more clear as we look at it a bitmore so now we're going to add anotherclass to the database user and then inthe user we're going to have a biographyfor the user and the person's nameso we have two users in our databaseConnor Connor often travels with agolden doodle named Bowen and Bob Bob isa prolific weightlifter who will getupset if he doesn't have a good gym towork out inso now what we're going to be doing iswe uh so we import our users into thedatabase and we see that they're inthere we're going to add this uh we'regoing to add a user Target for theadvertisement so each advertisement thatwe write a user Target ad for we'regoing to add a cross reference for thatand the interesting thing about that isthat we might not want to write one forall of the users you know we might wantto be clever with the way we do it andthings like thatso cool so now we change the prompt tosimilarly to how do we how we had thatgeneric Target now we're going to havethe target the following user and thenwe're going to pass in the userbiography that we had used by doingusers equals client.query.getuserbiography with additional ID becausewe're going to need this to do the crossreference later and then we get the datathis wayso now after we've added all the data wequery it and we'll see some of our ourresulting advertisements attention allweight lifters are you planning a tripto New York City and need a place tostay that won't compromise your workoutroutine if that's an advertisement forBobuh and then for Connor you haveattention all pet lovers are you lookingfor a pet friendly accommodation in theheart of New York City look no furtherthan the village of Harlem so you cansee how you know I hope that from thisyou can start to get a sense of all thethings that we can do with with thiskind of idea of generative feedbackloops all the different data sources wecan use the kind of compounding effectof saving this data back into thedatabase and so with that said let'sjump back into the podcast oh it's avery that was very interesting to seethat Airbnb exampleum uh Conor and that makes a lot ofsense so just to quickly recap whatwe're basically seeing here is thatwe're adding a data set without anydescriptions to the database but becausewe generate the description and feedbackloop that in it creates a vectorrepresentation and now we can dosemantic search over theseum uh these descriptions that is that iscorrect right yeah and so yeah I wouldlove to start on that example of now youhave something you can search throughand so to tell a quick story when I wasum when I gave a talk at odsc Londonlast year I was um you know I was tryingto think about presenting Vector searchfor data scientists people who are doinganalytical queries with most mostly liketabular symbolic data and you knowthey're thinking how do I uh usesemantic search on this kind of data andmy advice for that used to be maybe youcould translate it to text by justprompting it for with like feature nameequals value feature name equals valueand so on but now what we just saw withthe Airbnb is it took all theseproperties from Price you know minimumnights you have to stay at the Airbnbwhat neighborhood it's in and and andit's synced it up into a descriptionthen now you have something that you cansearch with text and so I think thatangle of turning tabular data unlockingthat with semantic search by putting itinto the generative model and producingthis kind of thing that is one of myfavorite artifacts so the example butsomething I really want to dive intonext Bob is this umjust this concept of you know Bob is agym rat and he's always got to be in thegymright because we're getting to a we'regetting to aum a situation where theum where we basically we're just gettingto real time uhum uh personalization of data which isjust if you think about it's likeevery I mean with the first generationof likeum for example reading newspaperswe had uh uh you know the newspaper wasday old that's now through the internetbecame real time but we're not going toa situation where it gets optimizedsomething that I'm in in line with iswhat I'm what I'm excited about is theum you could even go let's say that youhave a news article right and theremight be uh you gave earlier during thepodcast you gave this you said like youknow explain to me like I'm five yearsold of like explain it to me like I'm anexpert so a a journalist could writesomething only focusing on Experts onlyfocusing on experts but then real timeif somebody says like hey I'm an experton the topic of Finance but I'm a Noobon the on the uh um on the topic of umyeahum uh uh politics for example than acertain thing that's in the political uhin the sorry in the financial section ofthe newspaper could be specific for thisperson very into depth but when thisperson goes to the political section youcould just say okay we justmade it significantly easier and we onlyyou know we so we simplified it andthat's all happening real time and thatis something that is I think extremelyextremely exciting can you are there arethere so besides theum uh the example of air maybe are thereother examples that come to mind thatyou can think of yeah well for use casesyeah I think well I love what you justsaid that idea of the educationpersonalization like last night I wasplaying with the uh typescript clientand I'm you know I I don't even know thedifference between like npm and yarn soit's like you know I have thisparticular kind of knowledge but I'mmissing this plug and you have all thisdata about me imagine you know havingjust like every medium article I'vewritten maybe every slack message allthis thing to kind of build up thisembedding of my knowledge and then passit in and customize it I love that angleto how you present things but um yeah soI guess diving into another example I myyeah to stay on the Airbnb one morething I just I just love this idea oflike a per of the personalized travelexperience and just how you know likewhen I travel I generally travel with mydog and so like I need to plan my tripto New York accordingly and the things Iwant to do to say if I'm staying atweekend are going to be differentuh so yeah I think if we could even gointo this the Sci-Fi almost and youshared this a tweet this morning aboutsomething that is this generate TV showspersonalized to you how are you thinkingabout thisyeah so I like so actually there wasactually just before we recorded thispodcast I I was discussing and maybe wecan just cut a little piece of thatvideo in the uh in right nowso what we just seen in this in this inthis video is thatum a video was rendered based on just100 coming from these generative modelsand everything we're talking about rightnow the use cases are based on textum so I had the Airbnb example it's verypractical that is something people canstart you know using today but I thinkwhat this will grow into is like a lotwe see a lot of models evolve not onlyfor text but also multi-model models andand images and those kind of thingssoum what we're seeing here is this andthis is also why I'm so excited to workon effective database right so where westore information for example about amovieand interest about peopleum what you know how people like to tosee movies and those kind of things sonow you can see okay render this partfor me as if it's well as we've seen aWes Anderson movie or around this partis like it's part of the Matrix like wesaid with the news articles you can saylike hey if you are very much intoum I don't know costume dramas that youcan say like okay just make this longeror really go more into depth on the onthe um in the storyline or if you if youhate costume dramas like just just makethis a short thing right and the uh ifthat's in a movie soum the point that I'm trying to excitewith all with everything that'shappening right now with how thetechnology is evolving I I would not besurprised that inum I don't know a few years from now wewill watch the first uh uh um a movie orseries or whatever and it might startwith just five minutes or just 10minutes while we're watching somethingthat is completely really generated andthat the real-time generation is goodenough or that it can just pre-processsomething for somebody like in half anhour and that you know that Netflix sayslike okay your your next episode isready right we pre-process it for you Iwould beabsolutely I I I would could see thishappening and think about likeum if you think about also things likeAutoCAD and those kind of things whereit generates drawings where it helps youwith those kind of things you could feelit information about like if you have acertain building about like a history ofthe country about the or the city thatyou're building in maybe the type ofsoil you're building on and it justtakes all the information in so yes uhuh um uh text is the first iterationover this but with everything that'shappening and I think this this video isa nice example of that it's just this isjust going to be a matter of timeum and and it's amazing that of coursebesides the machine learning models Ithink that core infrastructureum uh um you know database like we'veyet plays a role in that so that'sthat's something I'm super excited aboutso so yeah so that that's how I that'show I look at it yeah I love how you'retelling the story of kind of theevolution of search and I think for ourlisteners it like can't be emphasizedenough sort of how novel this imagesearch is this multimodal search becauseI think kind of in this context withtext search you had you know you havethese things or you had keyword matchingand you have an inverted index and youhad all these tools built around thatyou had symbolic features like you hadthe page rank algorithm for Google whereyou use hyperlinks to get features aboutweb pages and kind of search with thatbut this kind of way of representingimages videos audios or you know the caddrawings that Bob's explaining with youknow when you have 3D structures ofbuilding designs like being able to putthese all in vectors and then unify allof this kind of data from differentmodalities into one kind of space whereyou can put an image to query for a songpotentially like all these kind ofthings and yes the the AI movie thing isso interesting to me I've been listeningto a lot of AI uh hip-hop music latelyeven though I don't think we can playthis if we if we cut and then play thatI think I think we'll be in troublebecauseI think our next podcast will need alawyeryeah exactly exactlyexactly yeah so it's like let's keep itup but people people can imagine peoplecan hallucinate uh what yeah what thatmight be like yeah so nobody's like it'sfunny it's like actually a um there's aum not not to go too far off topic butit is related there is a um there's anauthor that I'm that I'm a big fan ofum his name is Bruce Sterling andum I believe he calls himself afictional fictional design writer orsomething like thatthat is based on a concept that iscalled speculative design so it's like abig problem that we have with thinkingabout these concepts of where thingsgoing is thatum as the late clay Christensen alwaysuh um sets on he's the the HarvardProfessor clay Christmas attackand the future is beautiful it just hasone problem it has no data so it's likewe can't predict anything right basedbecause on the future so whatspeculative design doesit that it's a it's a method it's amethodology to try to determinepotential futuresandum one of the things that Bruce Sterlingsays is that often you see theseInnovations these Technical Innovationsand the impact that they havefirst in musicsoum the hip-hop example that you gave isa good example right so it'sum there's a lot of abstraction in musicso I mean I I know of people using uhyou know generative AI in music for along time already and of course it wasway morethe capabilities were way simpler sothose very abstract music but you couldalready start to see where this wasgoing and very early on so umhe makes a beautiful argument that hesays like hey if you want to know what'shappening what technology is causingjust look at music first because if it'schanging in the music industry then itwill probably trickle into otherIndustries orum uh in this case art forms early on aswell so it's a it's actually it's aninteresting uh example we should I'll weshould make sure to link to thesearticles in the uh in podcasts as wellyeah I mean in the description of thepodcast yeah yeah the whole thespeculative design all that kind of uhlike mental models of thinking that allthat is so interesting and I think it Ithink even just one more thing on themusic is it it really um really explainsthe vector database kind of part likelet's imagine we have these braincomputer interfaces that know so muchyeah the kind of music that I likecompared to the kind of music that Boblikes and these kind of like brainsignals they'll be you can representthem with vectors with models that thatyou know to vectors it to audio and syncit all up and yeah it's a prettyexciting feature and um yeah maybe maybeone more thing as you mentionedspeculative design Theory and I alwaysfind it personally very interesting likelearning these things from you you tellme uh like the jobs to be done frameworkand the most recent one you taught me inthe context of this uh General feedbackloops project has been aggregationTheory can you explain what that's aboutyeah so so aggregation theory is a is aconcept from a um a guy named BenThompson and he has this um this niceum block which is um uh is calledstrategory so it's not strategy butStrat Tech and that's his uhum uh that's that's basically that's hisjob and he just tries to capture what'shappening in um or the impact that thatthat the Tech Industries have having onthe world basically right especiallyfrom business perspectiveand of course in my role at the companyat weave yet I'm very interested in thisright so what we're talking about todayis super interesting and that is superum exciting however we um it's importantthat we you know keep in mind like howdo how does this add value into people'slives and then out of that comes likehow people use it and those kind ofthings and one of the things that hedescribes in this um in this frameworkis that before it's it's based on theinternetso and the role of that distributionchannels haveum and the control that they have so forexample think about a traditionalnewspaper the distribution was veryimportant because to get a newspaper itneeded to be distributed so there was awhole role for the distribution Channelum so the first iteration of that waslike because the distribution channelwas gone because it was just on theinternet there were like other outletsand other way to get information topeople and that is what aggregationTheory describes and what the impact onthis on business but I believe that whatwe now see with these at thesegenerative search Okay cases is that wejustgoing into like a next step into thisright so they were basically saying likeit now it's becoming for lack of abetter term it's becoming hyperpersonalized it's like it I mean I can Ican currently cannot think of a way tomake it more personalized than thisbecause it we have if you have the rightinformation so the example that you gavethat you like to travel with your dogthat is if you then can say hey I needto go to New York and we know what kindof Apartments you like what kind of howmuch money you like to spend that youtravel with your dog that isthat is so hyper personalized that it'slike a based on that first observationof in in aggregation Theory how howum uh basicallyumum the the internet shook up thesedistribution channels we have like thisnext Generation where we're basicallysaying like we're now basically shookingup these these these these databases orthese Outlets where uh where we havejust this generic content for everybodythat we can say no no now the nextiteration is like hyper personalize thisso I'm I am uh to use your terminologybeyond excitement about that I'm superexcited butumexactly I I have I have one morequestion for you as well so I'mI'm I'm curious to see the um how howare you observing ever so the the firstbig thing that we saw where theopportunity for like the feedback loopsand those kind of things had that becameum an an area of interest for us and andbear in mind for those listening the itis an area of interest for us because wetry to figure out how can defectivedatabase we've hit play a role in thisum I think the first thing that we sawwas the chat GPT plugins right or or amI am I missing something there I'm justcurious what your thoughts are on thatyou know how that's evolving and whatyou're seeing there yeah that would bereally great to talk about how thisimpacts with chat gbt and that generallythe kind of idea of you know theinterfaces the chat interfaces and whenyou save the conversation history andthen using that history because you knowevery conversation you have it comesback and I mean I I let me ask you thisquestion how many conversations do youthink you've had with Chad GBC so far II would say for me it's been at leastyou know at least 500 so far and it'sjust like been what like four months oldsomething like that so it's likeyeah it's so I'm so this is a greatquestion and I have to have to say notonly if I if you don't mind me makingthe um uh uh the the question a littlebit broaderI'm I'm I'm willing to go on record toadmit that uhI'm stillthere my brain is still processing thefact that I'm using natural language toget something from a data storeso regardless if it's if it's judgyptthat I ask questions so the other day Iwanted to have something sorted uh but II then I had to go through informationand I was like you know let's throw thatinto chegebt and see how it searchesthrough itum uh um or the other day I hadsomething where there was somethingstored in weaviate and that I used avery abstracta query to get the information out thenit gave me actually what I neededand I've still I my mind is still blownit's like it's like still in this in instate of being blown right it's likestill happening soum I'm starting to have more and moreinteractions uh uh uh also with withjgpt but I thinkwhat's more important here is just thatchange in the in the uh in the worldthat we're just going toa natural language way of interactingwith our systems that is for me justI'm still I'm still Aller I'm stillparsing that basically yeah yeah I amobsessed with this kind of text to SQLresearch and then thinking about howthat translates to alleviate and yeahfrom like the and I'll give a quickshout out to Jerry Lewis llama indexeshe's done some awesome content on thiskind of stuff but let me like this ideathat when I interact with the database Ijust say uh you know show me an exampleof ref that you searches throughe-commerce images and then the databaselike then it can parse out the query andknow what filters to add to the databasebecause I I love this kind of filteredVector search thing and I it's sayinglike uh when we had uh Sam Bean on fromyou.com and he described the kind of theidea of like a vertically integratedsearch engine if you seem likeperplexity AI you've seen how you can uhyou know do you want to search throughReddit do you want to search throughTwitter Wikipedia so so then you havethis filter you know where equalsWikipedia and and it's so excitingbecause in terms of like the technicalInnovation behind gain Vector databasesthere's so much exciting stuff with likeyou know modifying hnsw and routingthese things to have the filteredconnectivity so yeah that naturallanguage interaction where you just aska query and then it parses it all thatis so interesting but umyeah so so pivoting topics a bit comingback to the um the generative feedbackloop thing I think um for me the firsttime I started actually using this in mylife for my work is I was you know Itake these podcasts and I transcribethem with whisperlike yeah kick off a summarization ofthem and so then I saved thissummarization of the podcast so not soto me that's like that was the firstthing when I when I just started likeusing it for my actual like productivityand my job so yeah let me ask you maybelike um what what do you think like uhhow how are you using kind of generativefeedback loopsyeah so one of so there are two twoanswers to the um uh to the well they'reprobably multiple answers oh let methink that's a great question so uh Ithink on the most holistic levelso the first one is uh what you've shownwith the Airbnb exampleto generate data that is not in theoriginal data set so where we alwayshave been inferring insights that weneeded to have a human in the loop toinfer some insight from a data setum that we don't have to that we don'thave to do that anymore that we canautomate that away that is somethingthat I I'm thinking aboutum uh we're talking here about theseum uh um uh like I did these thesedescriptions for for Airbnb but thisthis can be anything right this can bethe houses that's that's for sale onlineit can be movie reviews it can be andthen we're just talking about text rightand so that can be anythingum it can be cyber security threatsright so that if we have learnedsomething in the past from complex cybersecurity threats we can store that inthe database feed that into modelcombined in the prompt it's like what doyou think of X Y and Z and then it givesus something and we store it back andnow we can search through it no etc etcso that is that is the first onethe second one goes back to what wassaid earlier that said hyperuh personalization so we could basicallysay like hey if we know thatum Conor is going to New York uh withhis dog and he's going to stay nearCentral Park we can already start togenerate content for you know um maybe Idon't know what you do with the dog buttake it or something I don't I don'tknow what you do with it but it's likeas you can say hey if that's somethingof out of interest you can go there andif you say yes that sort of Interestthen we can feedback with the back endthat you were actually interested inthat so in the future then if you gosomewhere else if you go to LA with yourdog then we know like no etc etc so Iwould on the on the on the highest levelI would sayum a combination ofumum head to so generating insights fromdata that that normally humans needed toinfer from the data and secondly justthat hyper personalization do in youropinion did I miss something or do youthink do you also see something oh yeahI think that hyper personalization Imean just like thinking about likebusiness Executives like you like I canimagine like you know an llm is like avirtual assistant for your schedulingyeah and and you know the travelingthing just you know keeping youorganized by knowing about theparticular things you like and all thatis so interesting um yeah it reallybrings me to kind of the the headlinerthat I was really excited to at the endof the pot because I wanted to hopefullywe kept the concrete enough in thisbeginning of well I and it's as crazy asit is this actually is pretty concreteit's not something that's just purelyhypothetical but um I don't know fromchat gbtwhich I think captured everyone'simagination it was like a whoa what isthis now we have Auto GPT which isanother like oh my what is this too thisis so much potential so Auto gbt withWii V8 you know it comes up with a planto perform a task it breaks it down intosteps and it saves the intermediatesteps back to the database it has thisyou know generative feedback it you knowit could maybe be prompted to know thatit can save its its intermediateGenerationswhat do you think Auto gbt with Wi-Fiwhere is this taking thisyeah so exactlyum uh exactly as we as uh I think as wementioned right so what you're basicallydoing is that you're sayingum the data the information that we'rerendering or pre-storing thatinformation because there is a Wi-Fiintegration in Auto GPT butthat always starts empty so it startswith research and then stores that andvectorizes it Etcbut what if you would say hey we have abind we have data we're going to storethatin in viviate and then you use Auto GPTto find stuff just imagine what thatmeans and bear in mind I always like tosay 89 of data is behind closed doors soum let me give you let me give you anexample Ium I spoke once to a lawyer and thislawyer said you know what the most usedand then I don't mean from a databaseperspective but from a consumerperspective but the most used tool isthat lawyers use to find stuff whenthey're writing you know documents orwhatever you know what the most usefulisGoogle searchso but the thing is the power is thatthere's the human in the loop that thisthe human lawyer looks at the documentsthat they have internally so the worddocuments the PDFs whatever they havefor whatever they're working onso they have that context in their headand then they use public Google orsomething to find something and thenadjust the documents accordingly to whatthey found so what are basically sayinglike if we take these documents and wesaw them in weave yetand something like Auto GPTum um Can can basically just createthosefeedback loops based on that informationhey I'm looking at this part of thelegal document but I need to know x yand zlet's find that onlinewe found somethingvectorized it store it back into leviateso long story short so the the that wasthe long answer the short answer is thatum with these kind of systems that whatAuto GPD is and what it's going towardsthat we're basically going to say hey ifwe pre-fill we create with informationabout something that cannot be accessedto the public internetthen all activity starts to function asa knowledge worker in which the databaseplays a tremendously important rolebecause that's where the information issits and is vectorized so that's how Isee that yeah it's amazing I rememberwhen uh you know when the uh child gbtAPI or the GB The Da Vinci 3 API waswhen we were playing around with itinitially and um we were exploring thekind of question decomposition where youhave a question that has two did ThomasEdison use a laptop and then you need tobreak that into okay when did ThomasEdison live when were laptops inventedand is that kind of like uh you knowthat kind of multi-hop question answermulti-hop is kind of the academic termfor that kind of idea so I remember whenwe were exploring that you showed methis idea and I have to always give youcredit for this because this was suchlike a woe to me that you were you wereyou were prompting it to populate a Jsondictionarywith if it wanted to ask anotherquestion what were the results of theintermediate questionand I think that's the biggest idea inthis kind of uh large language modelsthat use tools is that they can theywrite it in the API compatible way theycan output the Json they can see whatyou want to see it and yeah soit's it's so interesting because like ifit knows how to write the data toalleviate all this kind of stuffexactly exactly and that is something II am very curious six months from now ifthey would revisit this conversationwhere we are in uh um and the role thatthese these generative feedback loopsplay it's it's going to be excitingbecause we already see it but we're nowbasically going to support it extra fromthe perspective of the database sothat's just that's that's something I'mI'm super excited about soum I think I think we're there don't youthink because I think it's for everybodylistening they need to check out yourblog post and like the the the theGitHub repoters to start playing aroundwith this because this is not fictionthis is just people can do it right nowand we um I believe the Airbnb data setwill be available as well so that peoplecan just play around with it is that inPython and typescript I believe am I amI correct yeah Python and typescripttypescript was a new thing for me tolearn but it's really cool uh yeah likeum having the hover over it and see thetypes it can definitely help you uhnavigate a new JavaScript libraryyeah fantastic fantastic well thanks somuch uh Conor for letting me interviewyou
