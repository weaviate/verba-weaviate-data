{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the Generative Feedback Loops Podcast! We have also created a blog post and ... \nokay so I need to get into character \nhere we go \nhere we go here we go \nI'm beyond excitement to introduce Dr \nConnor Matthew shorten to his own \npodcast today \nbut we're gonna talk about something \nvery exciting but before we do that \ncongratulations because as people heard \nfrom the introduction you're now \nofficially a doctor so well done and \nwe're going to talk about something \nsuper exciting and normally of course \nyou interview people on the podcast but \nyou've been driving this the work behind \nthis so it would be makes more sense of \ncourse to interview you about what \nyou've been working on and and and by \nway of introduction uh before I'll hand \nit to you is we of course seen a lot of \nopportunity with Factor databases and \nlarge language models where people \ngenerate something and they want to \nstore that back into the database the \nsearch room and um we've kind of you \nknow called it like generative feedback \nloops and I would love to get a little \nbit of your understanding uh Conor as an \nintroduction to everybody watching what \nare our generative feedback loops yeah \nthanks so much Bob for the introduction \nand for having me on the podcast \nfor having you on your own podcast Yeah \nwell yeah I guess um I kind of so we \nhave for everyone listening we have a \ngreat uh tour of Concepts to explain \nthis generative feedback loop thing and \nthe general I think kind of a great tour \nwould be to kind of do like how you know \nthey have that like levels of \nabstraction explain it to me like I'm \nfive then I'm in high school college \ntechnical expert and so I'd say kind of \nthe the introduction thing is about how \nwe are prompting language models by \nputting your custom data into the prompt \nso you ask it a question like uh you \nknow what kind of what's Bob's favorite \nflavor of ice cream and then instead of \njust having the language model rely on \nthe knowledge it's learned from language \nmodeling the internet you retrieve \ninformation about Bob and then this is \nthe prompt that goes to the language \nmodel so that's been kind of the \nfoundation of this this kind of like \nretrieval augmented generation has been \nhuge and so now what we're looking at is \nfirstly just continuing to explore that \nall sorts of data sources that you can \nprompt and like how are we going to be \nmixing these prompts and having these \nlocal memories there's so much \nInnovation happening in that we've seen \nall these tools like Lang chain llama \nindex Auto gbt baby AGI just go on and \non about all these things \nand so \nyeah so uh yeah so maybe let me pass it \nback to you but like uh doing kind of \nthe highest level description of \ngenerative feedback loops uh like how \nwould you kind of summarize it quickly \nyeah so um it's very much aligned also \nwith with what you're saying so how I \nsee it is that the \num the first thing that we saw the \nopportunity with Factor databases if you \npurely look at text now so let's park \nother media types purely text that we \nsaw that we could actually change \nsomething that we had not stored in the \ndatabase we could use it on query time \nso the example we've always been using \nor at least I've always been using was \nif I store the data object \num the Eiffel Tower is in Paris we could \nretrieve that by searching for landmarks \nin France and that was always so if we \nhave like the document had the database \nitself or the data object is stored then \nwe had like on query time this this new \nopportunity with tractor databases but \nwith generative search I see it as like \nwe're now also doing something with the \noutput so we can say \nshow me landmarks in France \nand represent them as if they were a \nFacebook ad so it takes out the data \nobject and um and it and it then \ngenerates something from that and that \ncan be interesting in itself but I think \nit even becomes more interesting and \nthat's also something of course you're \ngonna also show us in a bit that we Loop \nthat back into the database because the \nexciting thing about this is in my \nopinion is that we now can store uh uh \ninformation back in the database which \nthat we can factorize again that was not \nstored um that was not in the original \num a data set and I have a question uh \nfor you so one thing that people often \num \nyou know what one critique that people \nsometimes have from these generative \nmodels is of course the hallucination \num uh so I mean if it's correct it's \namazing but sometimes if it's wrong then \nit's like well less than amazing and \nsometimes people argue that this \nfrom the injection basically so that we \nget the data object from the from the \nfactor database and we eject it injected \nin the model \num that adds a way to overcoming \nhallucination or a way for people \num to inject data in the model where um \nyou know on data that it can't be \ntrained on or that it wasn't trained on \nand what I mean with can't we train on I \nmean because of course technically \nspeaking you could train on everything \nbut maybe like legal documents or \nsomething that you have it might be \ndifficult to just throw that in the open \nto be trained on I'm I'm curious how you \nsee that would it be fair to say that \nthis is a way in helping to overcome uh \nhallucination or would that be a stretch \nyeah that are such an interesting topic \nis the hallucination when you do the \nprompt injection is it going to \nhallucinate and so I would adversely \nPoint people to a couple of resources \nthat I'm then going to summarize but um \nso uh John Shulman did a talk at UC \nBerkeley on The Late that's the latest \nupdate on reinforcing learning from \nHuman feedback about uh you know making \nreducing hallucination with that \noptimization strategy can't recommend \nthat enough I was also at uh Haystack \nlast week and Colin Nash did this \nawesome overview of all these generative \nfeedback uh sorry of uh hallucination \nthe cases of how it occurs and \nyeah it's so interesting I mean I think \nuh yeah you can there's obviously the \nprompting thing where you just kind of \ntell it please don't make anything up \nright it is explicitly say that yeah and \nthen I I really like kind of ideas \naround like the natural language \ninference thing where you have the \ncontext and the generated and you're \nusing these models that classify \nentailment or contradiction I think \nthat's a potentially promising way to \nyou know filter it out but um it does I \nfrom the start I I might be going a bit \noff but I I had this conversation with \nNathan Lampert from uh hug and face \nabout about this kind of thing where I \nwas like how great would it be if the \nrohf objective was don't hallucinate \ndirectly not not just be useful but you \ncould just make it make it like that and \nso so I think it'll be I think though I \nthink the optimization task will will \nfigure that out yeah can you talk yeah \ncan you talk a little bit more about \nthat so how how would that what would \nthat look like how would that how might \nit potentially work but what are the \nwhat are the ideas there how's that yeah \nso right now the the general thing is uh \njust um you know like did you enjoy this \nanswer right like that's the signal and \nyou know it's reinforcing learning train \nI think yeah and did maybe do the eoi \neoi 5 thing like um these aren't quite \nlanguage models anymore they they're \npre-trained by predicting the mass out \ntokens but now they're fine-tuned with \nreinforcement learning and the key thing \nto the key difference there is that in \nreinforcement learning you make several \ndecisions and then receive a sparse \nreward so you know the language model \neach token it generates is like a \ndecision and it with the mass language \nmodeling it receives feedback for each \ndecision because there's like truth to \nit but whereas with the reinforcement \nlearning you generate like you know 400 \ntokens and then receive the rewards so \nif you just change that objective to did \nyou generally enjoy this answer to did \nyou hallucinate anything from the \ncontext and you annotate a large enough \ndata set and then it's extremely likely \nthat that helps a lot and and yeah \nthere's I mean it's such an interesting \nthing how I love those pictures where \nit's like uh is explaining the language \nmodel where it's like this giant monster \nand then there's like a mask on the \nfront of it \nyeah exactly exactly I I think that's \nactually that's interesting you're \nsaying that because the um um to stay \nwith that metaphor it's the of the of \nthe of the monster right so the \num I something that I how I personally \nthink about that sometimes is like when \nwe look at like doing prompting \ninjection through the database \nis that we basically can say we want to \nuse the generative LM for its language \nunderstanding \num but we don't want it for its \nknowledge and I have a practical example \nand and to stay with the with the um the \nmonster examples like we want so the \nmonster is probably very strong and very \nbig so we want it for its muscles and we \nwant it for its strength what we just \nwanted to do what we want \nbasically so \num uh so the example that I that I \nsometimes give is that for a simple so \nto stick with that Eiffel Towers in \nParis example that you might store a \ndocument in the database that you \nfactorize that says something like the \nEiffel Tower always has been in Paris \nbut it's moved by truck to Barcelona \nmaking making this up right and so you \ncould factorize that and you can store \nthat so now if you have the the the the \nthe the query have um where's the Eiffel \nTower it will return that document first \nthat says that it's moved to Barcelona \nyou can feedback you can sorry you can \nLoop that into the llm and say like okay \nwhere's the Eiffel Tower we're trying to \nget the question where's the Eiffel \nTower and so but you must base it on the \ninformation we're giving you right now \nand then the llm responds like okay it \nyou know maybe something like hey it was \nalways in Paris \nbut now it's moved to Barcelona by truck \nsomething like that and that is kind of \nwhere we want to get so that we use it \nfor its uh for its language \nunderstanding but not per se for its for \nthe for the knowledge and it's \ninteresting and so the experiments we \nsee with like you know the the role of \nof the uh the temperature and those kind \nof things in the um those kind of \nsettings in in figuring that out but I \nthink it's it's super super interesting \nbut but before we before we dive into an \nexample so \nso because now we've went from the query \nto like the database to like output what \nso what would the can you explain like \nto this is what he what the feedback \nloop would be so how would the feedback \nloop be closed basically what what's \nhappening after it got the the \ninformation comes out of the generative \nllm yeah amazing so I think that was a \ngood a quick introduction to the \nretrieval augmented generation so now \nnow we're taking the next step where \nwe're talking about the title of the \npodcast the generative feedback loops \nwhich is where so we're going to take \nthe data and we're going to generate \nsomething and we're going to save it to \nthe database that because then we can \naccess that for future Generations we \ncan search through that it you know we \nwant to save it it's like our data that \nwe're using so so yeah I think I \nhopefully think that the example \nprobably I kind of like this example so \nwhy don't we Dive In \nyeah let's go hey everyone welcome to \nthe ABA generative feedback loop \ntutorial using a data set of Airbnb \nlistings we're going to be illustrating \nthe concept of generative feedback loops \nwhere we take data from the vector \ndatabase to inject into the prompt of a \nlarge language model and then we'll save \nthe resulting generation back into the \ndatabase to use for future prompt \ninjections or generally whatever we \nmight want to do with this generated \ndata say it's a summary of a podcast or \nin this case a description of an Airbnb \nlisting so let's dive right into it so \nfirstly all the code for this can be \nfound in weavate generative feedback \nloops in addition to this python \nnotebook we also have typescript \nexamples of how to do this so firstly \nwe'll install the wevia client with Pip \ninstall we via client and then as a \nbonus part of this we're going to be \nshowing weeviate embedded so we've had \nas recently released we get embedded \nwhere you no longer need to stand up a \nserver to connect to wevia you can now \nrun this right inside of your jupyter \nnotebook which is super convenient for \nyou know python developers looking to \nquickly get a sense of of how to use \nwevia before necessarily say putting a \ndatabase into production and all that \nkind of stuff so one other quick detail \nis in this tutorial we'll be using the \nopen AI uh the openai large language \nmodels you can also use the cohere \nlanguage models and this repository will \nalso contain a notebook with the cohere \ngenerations as well \nuh so if at any point you want to see \nwhich modules are running on your \nweeviate instance you can just do uh the \nclient.getmeta and you'll see the \nenabled modules and links to the \ndocumentation of where to learn more \nabout them so the embedded module is \ngoing to come with default these uh \nthese kind of generative search open AI \nuh the text Evac hug and face and all \nthese kind of things \nso first we're going to be loading our \nAirbnb data so this is a CSV file of \nAirbnb listings that we found on kaggle \nand so you know pretty standard python \nstuff to you know use the pandas library \nto read the CSV replace \num you know null or infinite or nand \nvalues and then just convert it to a \nlist of dictionaries so with this list \nof dictionaries the first entry you know \nwe have these keys for different values \nthe ID the property the name the quick \ndescription of it is his name and then \nuh you know you got the host name who's \nhosting this Airbnb you know what \nneighborhood is more particularly so \nKensington is a particular neighborhood \nof Brooklyn and then uh you know other \nthings about airbnbs like what type of \nroom it is you know the price you can \nimagine all these features like you know \ndoes it have a pool all that bedrooms \nbathrooms \nsquare feet all these kind of features \nthat describe an Airbnb so here's the \nfirst thing that is so interesting to me \nis that as of right now it would be very \nhard to just take these kind of tabular \nsymbolic features and pipeline that into \nsemantic search I used to have this \nrecommendation that the best way to do \nthis would be to do some kind of tabular \nto text translation where you have like \nfeature name equals feature value you \nknow in the next feature so it'd be like \nID equals 2539 name equals client clean \nand quiet sorry apartment home by the \npark and so that would be the text \nstring that you would embed and try to \nsearch with but what you're going to see \nwith generative feedback loops is we're \ngoing to sync this up into a written \ndescription that contains all this \ninformation and then by putting it back \ninto the vector search database you can \nsearch through the different airbnbs in \na much more natural way using semantic \nsearch so let's continue on the kind of \nhow do you do this with leviate so so \nthis is how you create schemas in weave \nusing the python client particularly so \nyou open up the classes because weeviate \nhas a a class schema where you know \nclasses are like tables in a database \nwhere you you can Define more than one \nclass basically and you can link the the \nclasses to each other with cross \nreferences which is you know similar to \nlike how most database systems have like \na key adjoining system so we Define the \nclasses listing we give a short \ndescription of the class and then we're \ngoing to be configurating the modules to \nuse on this class so the module \nconfiguration particularly is that you \nset in the schema is the vectorizer so \nsay this is going to be vectorized with \nref to VEC or you know that kind of \nthing but this is going to be vectorized \nwith the textivec open AI embedding \nmodel so then you just kind of tell it \nuh you know which which properties you \nwant to vectorize with the skip \nparameter on each individual property \nbut we'll get into that so then it's a \nvector index type we're going to be \nusing H and SW for this and then the \nother vectorizer is what we Define in \nthe module config uh so then what we \nhave is we Define a list of properties \nwith each property being you know like a \nattribute of the database table so this \nis our description this is what we're \ngoing to be generating and saving into \nthis is the you know the description of \nthe apartment listing that will be \nwritten by the large language model the \nproduct of our generative feedback loop \nuh so then we have all these other \nfeatures that we use to describe the \nAirbnb \nso you can also see how we have a mix of \nuh text features as well as number \nfeatures and please ignore that this is \nwritten as string because this should \nthis should say text but anyways uh cool \nso so then at the end of this we you \nknow we create the schema like this and \nthen we're going to be importing the \ndata into weviate so we're just going to \nbe uh you know looping through that uh \nthat data list that we had imported with \nour you know our pandas read CSV then DF \nto records save that in this data list \nso you know we just we configure the \nbatch Imports uh then we just Loop \nthrough this we're only going to do the \nfirst hundred \nanyway we just copy the keys get the \nvalid uuid because you know this is a \ndatabase and then we just add it to the \nbatch and it you know puts it into \nWeeknd all right so now that our data is \nin weba we can do a simple git query \nthis is this is the client syntax so uh \nmaybe you know listeners out there have \nseen the weba graphql console and you've \nseen these um graphql queries but each \nof the clients they also have kind of a \nquerying language like this so you do \nclient.query.getlisting and then you \nknow the property that you want to have \nand then you can append on these you \nknow filters like dot with near text or \nlike dot with hybrid dot with limit dot \nwith where so so that's kind of like \nwhat this syntax looks like with the \npython client uh cool so then we're \ngoing to add another class which is \ngoing to be our advertisements so we're \ngoing to be from the descriptions \nwriting advertisements and then \ngenerative feedback loop saving that \nback in the database so we also create \nso this is how you create uh another uh \nschema to add to the database \nand then we're going to add another \nproperty with this cross-reference from \nuh Airbnb listing to advertisement and \nthe named references has ADD so we just \nuse this to create that that new \nproperty from listing to the \nadvertisement \nso now the most exciting part of our \ntutorial we're going to be generating \nthe description the Airbnb description \nso what we do is we have this syntax \nwhere we have these curly brackets which \nis where we put in the property value so \nyou know with each of these prompts that \ngo into the language model you'll \nreplace the curly brackets with whatever \nthe feature value is and this is how you \nprompt it to the language model so so \nthis is kind of what I was talking about \nearlier where that you would represent \nyour data with some way like this to \nsearch through instead of doing this \ngenerated thing which is I think a \nreally exciting way to unify the most of \nthe data which is tabular organized data \nwith this new semantic search technology \nbut so here's more into the syntax so we \nwe have these generate properties that \nwe pipe in by doing you know \nclient.query docket listing generate \nproperties dot with generate we give it \nour prompt and then we uh and then we um \nalso give it oh sorry so we already gave \nit the properties within here because \nit's already a list so usually it'll be \nlike a list with the with the properties \nso cool so we also get the ID out \nbecause we're going to need to take this \nID in order to to add this new property \nback to its source so by taking the ID \nwe can then key value the ID to the new \ndescription so then we look through \nthese descriptions we have the new \nproperty which is the dictionary of what \nwe're going to be updating so then we \ntake that ID out from the underscore \nadditional ID which we got from here and \nthen we do client a data object at \nupdate the new property the class name \nand then this ID that the description \nwas sourced from \nso now we're going to see our resulting \ngenerated description so first we're \ngoing to insert description back into \nthis generate properties as we use the \nsyntax of you know class name and then \nthe properties you want to see so we'll \njust see the first one so we take all \nthese properties from the available \navailability of the room the \nneighborhood it's in the short \ndescription of it the price of it and we \nwrite this uh in the large language \nmodel Rice's description this private \nroom is located in the Flatbush \nneighborhood of Brooklyn offering a \nunique country space in the heart of the \ncity with a price of 150 per night so on \nso I think I think you get the idea but \nlike so this is the generated \ndescription that we've saved back into \nthe database so now let's say we want to \nquery the description so we dot get \nlisting description is what we're \nsearching what we want to return and \nthen dot with near text so this is how \nwe do our Vector search with Concepts \nbeing the name of the argument and then \nAirbnb near a place to walk my dog so \nwhat this means is we're going to take \nthis this phrase Airbnb near a place to \nwalk my dog transform that into a vector \nthat captures the semantics of this \nsentence or this phrase and then we're \ngoing to search for the semantic \nsimilarity between this and then all of \nthe generated descriptions we've done \nfor all of the Airbnb listings to try to \nfind you the best place to uh to walk \nyour dog so you see the results of that \nand how that lets you search through \nthese airbnbs with queries like you know \ntwo bedrooms hot tub or just whatever \nkind of casual language you want to use \nto describe the ideal Airbnb for you and \nin the future we can imagine all sorts \nof things from images and videos and \njust kind of the mind-blowing \nimplications of this kind of technology \nthat it continues to develop so now \nlet's let's keep generating stuff now \nlet's generate an advertisement \nso the prompt is now going to be please \nwrite an engaging advertisement for the \nfollowing Airbnb listing description and \nthen we're going to pipe again \ngenerative feedback loop we're going to \ntake that data that we saved in the \ndatabase and we're going to send it \nagain as input to the large language \nmodel and then we're going to again save \nthat result back to the database so \nagain this is how we do our generate \nquery visualize the first ad and then \nagain we're going to Loop through the \nads and we're going to take that out in \nthis case we're creating novel add \nobjects so we don't need the referencing \nuh ID we need the referencing ID for the \ncross reference so we you know we'll \ngenerate a random uuid for the \nadvertisement object but then we'll keep \nthe uuid which was the source of the \ndescription that generated this ad to \nuse to link to this ad with the cross \nreference between the classes or tables \nif if you want to think about it that \nway so now we'll be looking at the at a \nquick thing of how to use this \ncross-reference syntax when you're \nquerying weeviate so first we're going \nto set this where filter on the path so \nwe're searching through the Airbnb \nlisting things and we're going to add \nthis filter where where the listing has \ngreater than or equal to one \nadvertisement and then we're going to \nsee the description of the listing and \nthen has ADD and then now the cross \nreference takes us to the referenced ad \nand then now that we're in the ad uh \nclass similarly to this we take the \ncontent property out of it so we see how \nthe description uh this private room is \nlocated in the Flatbush neighborhood of \nBrooklyn and then we have the \nadvertisement and the advertisement is \nescape the hustle and bustle of the city \nand step into your own private country \nOasis in the heart of Brooklyn's \nFlatbush neighborhood so we see how we \nuse this description that we originally \nhad generated and saved in our database \nand now we're going to put that into the \nlanguage model and then feed it back \ninto the database now with this \nadvertisement so now let's go into \ntargeting advertisements so first we can \nimagine some generic ad targeting we add \na text property Target and we add that \nproperty to our database on the ads and \nnow we have these targets say young \ncouples elderly couples single Travelers \nand the generate prompt then becomes \nplease write an engaging advertisement \nfor the following Airbnb listing \ndescription and then we prompt inject \nthe description and then please write \nthe advertisement for this listing to \nTarget and then you know the target \nwhich is another property that we now \nhave but in this case I just put it in \nthis list but you you could retrieve it \nhowever you want to do it uh so so \nsimilarly we generate it you know we we \nuse the uuid to then link the new uh the \nnew advertisement to the referencing uh \nthe reference C or the referencer \nlisting uh so then we're going to look \nat this um you know as a single traveler \nso so this ad writes attention all solo \nTravelers are you looking for a cozy and \naffordable place to stay in the heart of \nBrooklyn and then you know make your \nsolo trip to Brooklyn Unforgettable \nthings like this so \nso now let's kind of think a little more \nabout all the different data sources \nthat we can grab from to prompt these \nlanguage models to write more more \ntargeted advertisements for these \nlistings or maybe even advertisement \nbecause advertisements sounds so kind of \nlike spammy in the past but now what \nwe're seeing is customized descriptions \nfor you so it's it's not written just to \nbe salesy but it's written to tailor to \nyour interests and hopefully this will \nbe more clear as we look at it a bit \nmore so now we're going to add another \nclass to the database user and then in \nthe user we're going to have a biography \nfor the user and the person's name \nso we have two users in our database \nConnor Connor often travels with a \ngolden doodle named Bowen and Bob Bob is \na prolific weightlifter who will get \nupset if he doesn't have a good gym to \nwork out in \nso now what we're going to be doing is \nwe uh so we import our users into the \ndatabase and we see that they're in \nthere we're going to add this uh we're \ngoing to add a user Target for the \nadvertisement so each advertisement that \nwe write a user Target ad for we're \ngoing to add a cross reference for that \nand the interesting thing about that is \nthat we might not want to write one for \nall of the users you know we might want \nto be clever with the way we do it and \nthings like that \nso cool so now we change the prompt to \nsimilarly to how do we how we had that \ngeneric Target now we're going to have \nthe target the following user and then \nwe're going to pass in the user \nbiography that we had used by doing \nusers equals client.query.getuser \nbiography with additional ID because \nwe're going to need this to do the cross \nreference later and then we get the data \nthis way \nso now after we've added all the data we \nquery it and we'll see some of our our \nresulting advertisements attention all \nweight lifters are you planning a trip \nto New York City and need a place to \nstay that won't compromise your workout \nroutine if that's an advertisement for \nBob \nuh and then for Connor you have \nattention all pet lovers are you looking \nfor a pet friendly accommodation in the \nheart of New York City look no further \nthan the village of Harlem so you can \nsee how you know I hope that from this \nyou can start to get a sense of all the \nthings that we can do with with this \nkind of idea of generative feedback \nloops all the different data sources we \ncan use the kind of compounding effect \nof saving this data back into the \ndatabase and so with that said let's \njump back into the podcast oh it's a \nvery that was very interesting to see \nthat Airbnb example \num uh Conor and that makes a lot of \nsense so just to quickly recap what \nwe're basically seeing here is that \nwe're adding a data set without any \ndescriptions to the database but because \nwe generate the description and feedback \nloop that in it creates a vector \nrepresentation and now we can do \nsemantic search over these \num uh these descriptions that is that is \ncorrect right yeah and so yeah I would \nlove to start on that example of now you \nhave something you can search through \nand so to tell a quick story when I was \num when I gave a talk at odsc London \nlast year I was um you know I was trying \nto think about presenting Vector search \nfor data scientists people who are doing \nanalytical queries with most mostly like \ntabular symbolic data and you know \nthey're thinking how do I uh use \nsemantic search on this kind of data and \nmy advice for that used to be maybe you \ncould translate it to text by just \nprompting it for with like feature name \nequals value feature name equals value \nand so on but now what we just saw with \nthe Airbnb is it took all these \nproperties from Price you know minimum \nnights you have to stay at the Airbnb \nwhat neighborhood it's in and and and \nit's synced it up into a description \nthen now you have something that you can \nsearch with text and so I think that \nangle of turning tabular data unlocking \nthat with semantic search by putting it \ninto the generative model and producing \nthis kind of thing that is one of my \nfavorite artifacts so the example but \nsomething I really want to dive into \nnext Bob is this um \njust this concept of you know Bob is a \ngym rat and he's always got to be in the \ngym \nright because we're getting to a we're \ngetting to a \num a situation where the \num where we basically we're just getting \nto real time uh \num uh personalization of data which is \njust if you think about it's like \nevery I mean with the first generation \nof like \num for example reading newspapers \nwe had uh uh you know the newspaper was \nday old that's now through the internet \nbecame real time but we're not going to \na situation where it gets optimized \nsomething that I'm in in line with is \nwhat I'm what I'm excited about is the \num you could even go let's say that you \nhave a news article right and there \nmight be uh you gave earlier during the \npodcast you gave this you said like you \nknow explain to me like I'm five years \nold of like explain it to me like I'm an \nexpert so a a journalist could write \nsomething only focusing on Experts only \nfocusing on experts but then real time \nif somebody says like hey I'm an expert \non the topic of Finance but I'm a Noob \non the on the uh um on the topic of um \nyeah \num uh uh politics for example than a \ncertain thing that's in the political uh \nin the sorry in the financial section of \nthe newspaper could be specific for this \nperson very into depth but when this \nperson goes to the political section you \ncould just say okay we just \nmade it significantly easier and we only \nyou know we so we simplified it and \nthat's all happening real time and that \nis something that is I think extremely \nextremely exciting can you are there are \nthere so besides the \num uh the example of air maybe are there \nother examples that come to mind that \nyou can think of yeah well for use cases \nyeah I think well I love what you just \nsaid that idea of the education \npersonalization like last night I was \nplaying with the uh typescript client \nand I'm you know I I don't even know the \ndifference between like npm and yarn so \nit's like you know I have this \nparticular kind of knowledge but I'm \nmissing this plug and you have all this \ndata about me imagine you know having \njust like every medium article I've \nwritten maybe every slack message all \nthis thing to kind of build up this \nembedding of my knowledge and then pass \nit in and customize it I love that angle \nto how you present things but um yeah so \nI guess diving into another example I my \nyeah to stay on the Airbnb one more \nthing I just I just love this idea of \nlike a per of the personalized travel \nexperience and just how you know like \nwhen I travel I generally travel with my \ndog and so like I need to plan my trip \nto New York accordingly and the things I \nwant to do to say if I'm staying at \nweekend are going to be different \nuh so yeah I think if we could even go \ninto this the Sci-Fi almost and you \nshared this a tweet this morning about \nsomething that is this generate TV shows \npersonalized to you how are you thinking \nabout this \nyeah so I like so actually there was \nactually just before we recorded this \npodcast I I was discussing and maybe we \ncan just cut a little piece of that \nvideo in the uh in right now \nso what we just seen in this in this in \nthis video is that \num a video was rendered based on just \n100 coming from these generative models \nand everything we're talking about right \nnow the use cases are based on text \num so I had the Airbnb example it's very \npractical that is something people can \nstart you know using today but I think \nwhat this will grow into is like a lot \nwe see a lot of models evolve not only \nfor text but also multi-model models and \nand images and those kind of things \nso \num what we're seeing here is this and \nthis is also why I'm so excited to work \non effective database right so where we \nstore information for example about a \nmovie \nand interest about people \num what you know how people like to to \nsee movies and those kind of things so \nnow you can see okay render this part \nfor me as if it's well as we've seen a \nWes Anderson movie or around this part \nis like it's part of the Matrix like we \nsaid with the news articles you can say \nlike hey if you are very much into \num I don't know costume dramas that you \ncan say like okay just make this longer \nor really go more into depth on the on \nthe um in the storyline or if you if you \nhate costume dramas like just just make \nthis a short thing right and the uh if \nthat's in a movie so \num the point that I'm trying to excite \nwith all with everything that's \nhappening right now with how the \ntechnology is evolving I I would not be \nsurprised that in \num I don't know a few years from now we \nwill watch the first uh uh um a movie or \nseries or whatever and it might start \nwith just five minutes or just 10 \nminutes while we're watching something \nthat is completely really generated and \nthat the real-time generation is good \nenough or that it can just pre-process \nsomething for somebody like in half an \nhour and that you know that Netflix says \nlike okay your your next episode is \nready right we pre-process it for you I \nwould be \nabsolutely I I I would could see this \nhappening and think about like \num if you think about also things like \nAutoCAD and those kind of things where \nit generates drawings where it helps you \nwith those kind of things you could feel \nit information about like if you have a \ncertain building about like a history of \nthe country about the or the city that \nyou're building in maybe the type of \nsoil you're building on and it just \ntakes all the information in so yes uh \nuh um uh text is the first iteration \nover this but with everything that's \nhappening and I think this this video is \na nice example of that it's just this is \njust going to be a matter of time \num and and it's amazing that of course \nbesides the machine learning models I \nthink that core infrastructure \num uh um you know database like we've \nyet plays a role in that so that's \nthat's something I'm super excited about \nso so yeah so that that's how I that's \nhow I look at it yeah I love how you're \ntelling the story of kind of the \nevolution of search and I think for our \nlisteners it like can't be emphasized \nenough sort of how novel this image \nsearch is this multimodal search because \nI think kind of in this context with \ntext search you had you know you have \nthese things or you had keyword matching \nand you have an inverted index and you \nhad all these tools built around that \nyou had symbolic features like you had \nthe page rank algorithm for Google where \nyou use hyperlinks to get features about \nweb pages and kind of search with that \nbut this kind of way of representing \nimages videos audios or you know the cad \ndrawings that Bob's explaining with you \nknow when you have 3D structures of \nbuilding designs like being able to put \nthese all in vectors and then unify all \nof this kind of data from different \nmodalities into one kind of space where \nyou can put an image to query for a song \npotentially like all these kind of \nthings and yes the the AI movie thing is \nso interesting to me I've been listening \nto a lot of AI uh hip-hop music lately \neven though I don't think we can play \nthis if we if we cut and then play that \nI think I think we'll be in trouble \nbecause \nI think our next podcast will need a \nlawyer \nyeah exactly exactly \nexactly yeah so it's like let's keep it \nup but people people can imagine people \ncan hallucinate uh what yeah what that \nmight be like yeah so nobody's like it's \nfunny it's like actually a um there's a \num not not to go too far off topic but \nit is related there is a um there's an \nauthor that I'm that I'm a big fan of \num his name is Bruce Sterling and \num I believe he calls himself a \nfictional fictional design writer or \nsomething like that \nthat is based on a concept that is \ncalled speculative design so it's like a \nbig problem that we have with thinking \nabout these concepts of where things \ngoing is that \num as the late clay Christensen always \nuh um sets on he's the the Harvard \nProfessor clay Christmas attack \nand the future is beautiful it just has \none problem it has no data so it's like \nwe can't predict anything right based \nbecause on the future so what \nspeculative design does \nit that it's a it's a method it's a \nmethodology to try to determine \npotential futures \nand \num one of the things that Bruce Sterling \nsays is that often you see these \nInnovations these Technical Innovations \nand the impact that they have \nfirst in music \nso \num the hip-hop example that you gave is \na good example right so it's \num there's a lot of abstraction in music \nso I mean I I know of people using uh \nyou know generative AI in music for a \nlong time already and of course it was \nway more \nthe capabilities were way simpler so \nthose very abstract music but you could \nalready start to see where this was \ngoing and very early on so um \nhe makes a beautiful argument that he \nsays like hey if you want to know what's \nhappening what technology is causing \njust look at music first because if it's \nchanging in the music industry then it \nwill probably trickle into other \nIndustries or \num uh in this case art forms early on as \nwell so it's a it's actually it's an \ninteresting uh example we should I'll we \nshould make sure to link to these \narticles in the uh in podcasts as well \nyeah I mean in the description of the \npodcast yeah yeah the whole the \nspeculative design all that kind of uh \nlike mental models of thinking that all \nthat is so interesting and I think it I \nthink even just one more thing on the \nmusic is it it really um really explains \nthe vector database kind of part like \nlet's imagine we have these brain \ncomputer interfaces that know so much \nyeah the kind of music that I like \ncompared to the kind of music that Bob \nlikes and these kind of like brain \nsignals they'll be you can represent \nthem with vectors with models that that \nyou know to vectors it to audio and sync \nit all up and yeah it's a pretty \nexciting feature and um yeah maybe maybe \none more thing as you mentioned \nspeculative design Theory and I always \nfind it personally very interesting like \nlearning these things from you you tell \nme uh like the jobs to be done framework \nand the most recent one you taught me in \nthe context of this uh General feedback \nloops project has been aggregation \nTheory can you explain what that's about \nyeah so so aggregation theory is a is a \nconcept from a um a guy named Ben \nThompson and he has this um this nice \num block which is um uh is called \nstrategory so it's not strategy but \nStrat Tech and that's his uh \num uh that's that's basically that's his \njob and he just tries to capture what's \nhappening in um or the impact that that \nthat the Tech Industries have having on \nthe world basically right especially \nfrom business perspective \nand of course in my role at the company \nat weave yet I'm very interested in this \nright so what we're talking about today \nis super interesting and that is super \num exciting however we um it's important \nthat we you know keep in mind like how \ndo how does this add value into people's \nlives and then out of that comes like \nhow people use it and those kind of \nthings and one of the things that he \ndescribes in this um in this framework \nis that before it's it's based on the \ninternet \nso and the role of that distribution \nchannels have \num and the control that they have so for \nexample think about a traditional \nnewspaper the distribution was very \nimportant because to get a newspaper it \nneeded to be distributed so there was a \nwhole role for the distribution Channel \num so the first iteration of that was \nlike because the distribution channel \nwas gone because it was just on the \ninternet there were like other outlets \nand other way to get information to \npeople and that is what aggregation \nTheory describes and what the impact on \nthis on business but I believe that what \nwe now see with these at these \ngenerative search Okay cases is that we \njust \ngoing into like a next step into this \nright so they were basically saying like \nit now it's becoming for lack of a \nbetter term it's becoming hyper \npersonalized it's like it I mean I can I \ncan currently cannot think of a way to \nmake it more personalized than this \nbecause it we have if you have the right \ninformation so the example that you gave \nthat you like to travel with your dog \nthat is if you then can say hey I need \nto go to New York and we know what kind \nof Apartments you like what kind of how \nmuch money you like to spend that you \ntravel with your dog that is \nthat is so hyper personalized that it's \nlike a based on that first observation \nof in in aggregation Theory how how \num uh basically \num \num the the internet shook up these \ndistribution channels we have like this \nnext Generation where we're basically \nsaying like we're now basically shooking \nup these these these these databases or \nthese Outlets where uh where we have \njust this generic content for everybody \nthat we can say no no now the next \niteration is like hyper personalize this \nso I'm I am uh to use your terminology \nbeyond excitement about that I'm super \nexcited but \num \nexactly I I have I have one more \nquestion for you as well so I'm \nI'm I'm curious to see the um how how \nare you observing ever so the the first \nbig thing that we saw where the \nopportunity for like the feedback loops \nand those kind of things had that became \num an an area of interest for us and and \nbear in mind for those listening the it \nis an area of interest for us because we \ntry to figure out how can defective \ndatabase we've hit play a role in this \num I think the first thing that we saw \nwas the chat GPT plugins right or or am \nI am I missing something there I'm just \ncurious what your thoughts are on that \nyou know how that's evolving and what \nyou're seeing there yeah that would be \nreally great to talk about how this \nimpacts with chat gbt and that generally \nthe kind of idea of you know the \ninterfaces the chat interfaces and when \nyou save the conversation history and \nthen using that history because you know \nevery conversation you have it comes \nback and I mean I I let me ask you this \nquestion how many conversations do you \nthink you've had with Chad GBC so far I \nI would say for me it's been at least \nyou know at least 500 so far and it's \njust like been what like four months old \nsomething like that so it's like \nyeah it's so I'm so this is a great \nquestion and I have to have to say not \nonly if I if you don't mind me making \nthe um uh uh the the question a little \nbit broader \nI'm I'm I'm willing to go on record to \nadmit that uh \nI'm still \nthere my brain is still processing the \nfact that I'm using natural language to \nget something from a data store \nso regardless if it's if it's judgypt \nthat I ask questions so the other day I \nwanted to have something sorted uh but I \nI then I had to go through information \nand I was like you know let's throw that \ninto chegebt and see how it searches \nthrough it \num uh um or the other day I had \nsomething where there was something \nstored in weaviate and that I used a \nvery abstract \na query to get the information out then \nit gave me actually what I needed \nand I've still I my mind is still blown \nit's like it's like still in this in in \nstate of being blown right it's like \nstill happening so \num I'm starting to have more and more \ninteractions uh uh uh also with with \njgpt but I think \nwhat's more important here is just that \nchange in the in the uh in the world \nthat we're just going to \na natural language way of interacting \nwith our systems that is for me just \nI'm still I'm still Aller I'm still \nparsing that basically yeah yeah I am \nobsessed with this kind of text to SQL \nresearch and then thinking about how \nthat translates to alleviate and yeah \nfrom like the and I'll give a quick \nshout out to Jerry Lewis llama indexes \nhe's done some awesome content on this \nkind of stuff but let me like this idea \nthat when I interact with the database I \njust say uh you know show me an example \nof ref that you searches through \ne-commerce images and then the database \nlike then it can parse out the query and \nknow what filters to add to the database \nbecause I I love this kind of filtered \nVector search thing and I it's saying \nlike uh when we had uh Sam Bean on from \nyou.com and he described the kind of the \nidea of like a vertically integrated \nsearch engine if you seem like \nperplexity AI you've seen how you can uh \nyou know do you want to search through \nReddit do you want to search through \nTwitter Wikipedia so so then you have \nthis filter you know where equals \nWikipedia and and it's so exciting \nbecause in terms of like the technical \nInnovation behind gain Vector databases \nthere's so much exciting stuff with like \nyou know modifying hnsw and routing \nthese things to have the filtered \nconnectivity so yeah that natural \nlanguage interaction where you just ask \na query and then it parses it all that \nis so interesting but um \nyeah so so pivoting topics a bit coming \nback to the um the generative feedback \nloop thing I think um for me the first \ntime I started actually using this in my \nlife for my work is I was you know I \ntake these podcasts and I transcribe \nthem with whisper \nlike yeah kick off a summarization of \nthem and so then I saved this \nsummarization of the podcast so not so \nto me that's like that was the first \nthing when I when I just started like \nusing it for my actual like productivity \nand my job so yeah let me ask you maybe \nlike um what what do you think like uh \nhow how are you using kind of generative \nfeedback loops \nyeah so one of so there are two two \nanswers to the um uh to the well they're \nprobably multiple answers oh let me \nthink that's a great question so uh I \nthink on the most holistic level \nso the first one is uh what you've shown \nwith the Airbnb example \nto generate data that is not in the \noriginal data set so where we always \nhave been inferring insights that we \nneeded to have a human in the loop to \ninfer some insight from a data set \num that we don't have to that we don't \nhave to do that anymore that we can \nautomate that away that is something \nthat I I'm thinking about \num uh we're talking here about these \num uh um uh like I did these these \ndescriptions for for Airbnb but this \nthis can be anything right this can be \nthe houses that's that's for sale online \nit can be movie reviews it can be and \nthen we're just talking about text right \nand so that can be anything \num it can be cyber security threats \nright so that if we have learned \nsomething in the past from complex cyber \nsecurity threats we can store that in \nthe database feed that into model \ncombined in the prompt it's like what do \nyou think of X Y and Z and then it gives \nus something and we store it back and \nnow we can search through it no etc etc \nso that is that is the first one \nthe second one goes back to what was \nsaid earlier that said hyper \nuh personalization so we could basically \nsay like hey if we know that \num Conor is going to New York uh with \nhis dog and he's going to stay near \nCentral Park we can already start to \ngenerate content for you know um maybe I \ndon't know what you do with the dog but \ntake it or something I don't I don't \nknow what you do with it but it's like \nas you can say hey if that's something \nof out of interest you can go there and \nif you say yes that sort of Interest \nthen we can feedback with the back end \nthat you were actually interested in \nthat so in the future then if you go \nsomewhere else if you go to LA with your \ndog then we know like no etc etc so I \nwould on the on the on the highest level \nI would say \num a combination of \num \num head to so generating insights from \ndata that that normally humans needed to \ninfer from the data and secondly just \nthat hyper personalization do in your \nopinion did I miss something or do you \nthink do you also see something oh yeah \nI think that hyper personalization I \nmean just like thinking about like \nbusiness Executives like you like I can \nimagine like you know an llm is like a \nvirtual assistant for your scheduling \nyeah and and you know the traveling \nthing just you know keeping you \norganized by knowing about the \nparticular things you like and all that \nis so interesting um yeah it really \nbrings me to kind of the the headliner \nthat I was really excited to at the end \nof the pot because I wanted to hopefully \nwe kept the concrete enough in this \nbeginning of well I and it's as crazy as \nit is this actually is pretty concrete \nit's not something that's just purely \nhypothetical but um I don't know from \nchat gbt \nwhich I think captured everyone's \nimagination it was like a whoa what is \nthis now we have Auto GPT which is \nanother like oh my what is this too this \nis so much potential so Auto gbt with \nWii V8 you know it comes up with a plan \nto perform a task it breaks it down into \nsteps and it saves the intermediate \nsteps back to the database it has this \nyou know generative feedback it you know \nit could maybe be prompted to know that \nit can save its its intermediate \nGenerations \nwhat do you think Auto gbt with Wi-Fi \nwhere is this taking this \nyeah so exactly \num uh exactly as we as uh I think as we \nmentioned right so what you're basically \ndoing is that you're saying \num the data the information that we're \nrendering or pre-storing that \ninformation because there is a Wi-Fi \nintegration in Auto GPT but \nthat always starts empty so it starts \nwith research and then stores that and \nvectorizes it Etc \nbut what if you would say hey we have a \nbind we have data we're going to store \nthat \nin in viviate and then you use Auto GPT \nto find stuff just imagine what that \nmeans and bear in mind I always like to \nsay 89 of data is behind closed doors so \num let me give you let me give you an \nexample I \num I spoke once to a lawyer and this \nlawyer said you know what the most used \nand then I don't mean from a database \nperspective but from a consumer \nperspective but the most used tool is \nthat lawyers use to find stuff when \nthey're writing you know documents or \nwhatever you know what the most useful \nis \nGoogle search \nso but the thing is the power is that \nthere's the human in the loop that this \nthe human lawyer looks at the documents \nthat they have internally so the word \ndocuments the PDFs whatever they have \nfor whatever they're working on \nso they have that context in their head \nand then they use public Google or \nsomething to find something and then \nadjust the documents accordingly to what \nthey found so what are basically saying \nlike if we take these documents and we \nsaw them in weave yet \nand something like Auto GPT \num um Can can basically just create \nthose \nfeedback loops based on that information \nhey I'm looking at this part of the \nlegal document but I need to know x y \nand z \nlet's find that online \nwe found something \nvectorized it store it back into leviate \nso long story short so the the that was \nthe long answer the short answer is that \num with these kind of systems that what \nAuto GPD is and what it's going towards \nthat we're basically going to say hey if \nwe pre-fill we create with information \nabout something that cannot be accessed \nto the public internet \nthen all activity starts to function as \na knowledge worker in which the database \nplays a tremendously important role \nbecause that's where the information is \nsits and is vectorized so that's how I \nsee that yeah it's amazing I remember \nwhen uh you know when the uh child gbt \nAPI or the GB The Da Vinci 3 API was \nwhen we were playing around with it \ninitially and um we were exploring the \nkind of question decomposition where you \nhave a question that has two did Thomas \nEdison use a laptop and then you need to \nbreak that into okay when did Thomas \nEdison live when were laptops invented \nand is that kind of like uh you know \nthat kind of multi-hop question answer \nmulti-hop is kind of the academic term \nfor that kind of idea so I remember when \nwe were exploring that you showed me \nthis idea and I have to always give you \ncredit for this because this was such \nlike a woe to me that you were you were \nyou were prompting it to populate a Json \ndictionary \nwith if it wanted to ask another \nquestion what were the results of the \nintermediate question \nand I think that's the biggest idea in \nthis kind of uh large language models \nthat use tools is that they can they \nwrite it in the API compatible way they \ncan output the Json they can see what \nyou want to see it and yeah so \nit's it's so interesting because like if \nit knows how to write the data to \nalleviate all this kind of stuff \nexactly exactly and that is something I \nI am very curious six months from now if \nthey would revisit this conversation \nwhere we are in uh um and the role that \nthese these generative feedback loops \nplay it's it's going to be exciting \nbecause we already see it but we're now \nbasically going to support it extra from \nthe perspective of the database so \nthat's just that's that's something I'm \nI'm super excited about so \num I think I think we're there don't you \nthink because I think it's for everybody \nlistening they need to check out your \nblog post and like the the the the \nGitHub repoters to start playing around \nwith this because this is not fiction \nthis is just people can do it right now \nand we um I believe the Airbnb data set \nwill be available as well so that people \ncan just play around with it is that in \nPython and typescript I believe am I am \nI correct yeah Python and typescript \ntypescript was a new thing for me to \nlearn but it's really cool uh yeah like \num having the hover over it and see the \ntypes it can definitely help you uh \nnavigate a new JavaScript library \nyeah fantastic fantastic well thanks so \nmuch uh Conor for letting me interview \nyou I hope how did I do did I did I do a \ndecent job yeah also you got to ask \neveryone to like thanks so much for \nwatching please like And
