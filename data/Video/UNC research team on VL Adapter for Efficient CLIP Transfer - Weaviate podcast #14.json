{"text": "Please check out VL-Adapter (CVPR 2022): https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06825 ! Thanks for watching the Weaviate podcast! \n[Music] \nhey everyone i'm super excited to be \npresenting a new style for the we vva \npodcast in this podcast episode we have \nthe authors of the paper yielding sung j \nmin cho and professor mohit bonsal a \nresearch team from the university of \nnorth carolina at chapel hill to explain \nthis paper vl adapter parameter \nefficient transfer learning for vision \nand language tasks and the reason this \npaper stood out to me as being so \ninteresting is you see how these this \nbullet point right here with the \nhighlighted green text you only need to \nupdate about four percent of the \nparameters of clip when you're \nfine-tuning it for downstream tasks so \nyou don't have to have the cost storage \noverhead of fine-tuning the full 100 \nof a pre-trained clip model rather you \nonly need to have four percent of the \nupdated parameters which are added in \nthese sparse adapter layers that are \ninterleaved with the original model \narchitecture so this podcast will \ncompletely get into the details of \nexactly how these authors set up these \nexperiments for having these sparse \nlayers that you use to fine-tune \nsomething like a pre-trained clip \ncheckpoint for different vision and \nlanguage downstream tasks and that's \nanother really interesting detail about \nthis is exploring exactly what vision \nand language data sets the authors were \nusing to explore these questions this \npaper was accepted into cvpr2022 \nit's a really great read i highly \nrecommend it and i really hope you enjoy \nthis podcast breaking down the details \nof the vl adapter paper so quickly \nbefore getting into the details of the \npodcast i also wanted to point you to \nsome examples of using clip within the \nwev8 example so in case people out there \naren't familiar with this if you go to \ngithub semi technologies slash we've ate \nexamples and please leave a star while \nyou're at it you can see all these great \nexamples of uh things that people have \nbuilt with we've eat you see searching \nthrough podcasts searching through plant \ninformation harry potter question \nanswering and in this quick little \nexample i want to show you this clip \nmultimodal text image search example so \nwithin this clip multimodal text image \nsearch you see how you can build a user \ninterface for having your text to image \nsearch through using this pre-trained \nclip model so hopefully this kind of \nseeing this in action and seeing how you \ncan use this will further motivate your \ninterest in vl adapter and knowing that \nyou could you know fine tune a clip add \nthat fine tuned model into we v8 and \nthen you can do this kind of text to \nimage search and it's very exciting i \nthink having this multi-modal image and \ntext space i think is really something \nnovel you see when wev8 as you're \nsetting up your docker compose file you \ncan go down to \nsay clip as the model that you want to \nvectorize your data hey everyone thank \nyou so much for checking out the wva \npodcast i'm super excited to be \nwelcoming a research team from the \nuniversity of north carolina the recent \npaper v l adapter is such an exciting \nfinding with the clip model the clip \ncontrastive language image pre-training \nmodel is such an exciting model for \nproducing embeddings of both images as \nwell as text and having this vision \nlanguage cross model multimodal kind of \ncrossover and it's one of the most \nexciting examples of this is the clip \nmodel it's built into the vva backend \nfor something that you can vectorize \nyour input data it's available with gina \nai's clip as a service and it's been \nsuch an exciting thing to \nplay around with generally the clip \nsoftware and i'm so excited to learn \nabout this vln vl adapter it's a \nstrategy to only have to fine-tune about \nfour percent of the parameters of clips \nso as we talk about taking this uh \noff-the-shelf pre-trained model and then \nusing it in the typical kind of transfer \nlearning flow as we're similar with \nthings like hugging face where you take \nthese pre-trained weights and then \nfine-tune them on your data set this new \nadvancement in vl adapter is going to be \nhuge for the you know the cost \nimplications of doing this and trying to \nfine-tune the massive uh model so so \nfirst of all team thank you so much for \ncoming on this podcast \nthanks very much thanks very much thanks \nfor having us \nand so uh can you tell us about like the \nif you had to explain vl adapter sort of \nas fast as possible how would you uh um \nso view adapter is just a work that we \nwant to adapt to the existing language \nmodel a combination of language model \nand visual model 2 vision language task \nwith the minimum parameters \nused possible \nso yeah and we just want those \nadded parameters learn visual language \nlike representations but the rest of \nthem still kept \nthe same \nas before so \nyeah it kind of brings a new paradigm \nthat how to design the vision language \narchitecture that you don't have to find \ntwo whole parameters you just only have \nto add several pampers into those \nparameters and you can achieve \neverything it's yeah it could be \nexciting \nso can you tell me a little bit more \nabout what kind of added layers you were \nputting in the middle of these models is \nit just say like a mlp dense layer in \nbetween layers six and seven or is it a \nsay normalization layer with where you \nhave the scale and shift parameters how \nexactly is the model surgery being done \nas you add in these new weights for the \nfine tuning \nyeah so the layers we add is called \nadapter layer and it we the architecture \nwe've tried several architectures so \nlike the typical adapter is actually \njust like a two \nuh fully connected layers and it form \nlet the two layers form a bottleneck \nstructure so the hidden dimensions so \ninput \nand \nfit to the first layer and then there's \na hidden dimension hidden representation \nand then the other layer will output the \nfinal representation and the hidden \ndimension the hidden representation is \nsmaller than the input so it's a \nbottleneck structure and this is \nactually a typical \nstructure of adapter \nbut we also try several other variations \nlike compactor that can \nuse like low rank approximation to \ndecompose the \nsum of the linear weights to like \nsmaller weights to save efficiency \nsomething \nyeah to give a little more like detail \nof the adapter and who's not familiar \nwith like the vision language \npre-training so there's a recently uh \nfirst first of like a vision language \nbird including like a billboard \nblacksmith blt5 uh dealer and so on \nwhere they combined the featuring \nlanguage model with some vision \nincorporation and \nand most of the previous models jointly \nbinding both \nuh old entire language model and the \nrecently uh \nthe adapter that are from nlp uh field \nand they only insert the specific beat \nboard network that is uh as i mentioned \nlike a bottleneck structure at each \ntransformer blocks and we also follow \nthat \nuh adapter layer and explore how it \nworks for digital equipment so i think \nthere's kind of two things in that i \nquickly want to unpack and uh the first \nthing for yelin can you tell me so this \ncompression bottleneck the idea of the \nadapter as well as the low rank \nfactorization is say the intermediate \ndimension of the representation is 1024 \nyou're gonna compress it into say 256 \nand then blow it back into 1024 to put \nit back into the model uh did you maybe \nlike ablate that detail is is that \ndetail important for making this work in \ngeneral \nit it's not important but one very \nimportant signal is that the bottleneck \nthe bottom time dimension is \nis better than smaller than the input \ndimension it can be like \nso like this \nso for example if your input dimension \nis 100 that usually the heat of \ndimension you can either work with 30 50 \n70 they will work they all work but if \nyou put it as 100 or more than 100 it \nprobably won't work so yeah so any \nnumber smaller than the input dimension \nwill work so yeah not super important \nbut good to know \nyeah i think that's an interesting \ndetail too is the compression \nbottlenecks i found that that is like a \ngood way to train neural networks \nwhether it's auto encoders or general \nthat kind of thing and if we could talk \na little bit quickly about this strategy \nand transformers where you say \nmask out the cls token representation so \nit doesn't have the traditional kind of \ncompression bottleneck that \nconvolutional neural networks had but \nyou have that kind of indexing and then \nmaybe you have a compression bottleneck \nin that \njust curious if you have any thoughts on \nthat kind of say isomorphic architecture \nas they call it and the kind of general \nuse of compression bottlenecks in deep \nneural networks uh \ni actually do not have any too much \nintuition on why this would like the the \ncompression bottleneck will work better \nbecause if you see in the transformer \nblock there's a feedforward layers right \nand they actually use the inverted like \nbottom block so the hidden dimension is \nbigger so i think that sometimes it \nneeds bigger but sometimes they need \nsmaller it's maybe like confused i'm not \nreally sure like why this would work not \nwhat has happened i think all i know is \nlike empirically \nyeah adapter only works for like smaller \ndimension \nyeah i think it kind of comes back to \nlike the categorical embeddings the way \nit can like blow up the intermediate \nrepresentation space and say you have \nlike um the vector quantized variational \nautoencoder the gans the way that they \ncan take these big latent spaces \ncompress them all the way into discrete \nbottlenecks and then blow back up the \nlatent space i generally just think this \nkind of like the compression of it is so \ninteresting generally right and um so \nanother question i had for jamin with \nwhat you said is so there's two parts of \nthe clip model there's the resnet image \nhalf and then there's say the bar \ndecoder half can you tell me a little \nmore about uh that encoder decoder of \nthe bar architecture as well as the \nresnet and like the particular details \nfor people looking to you know really \nget their hands dirty with clip \nokay sure yeah uh we use a \npart or any kind of like a sequel \nbecause language model in our experiment \nwe use a fourth host part and t5 \nso we extend the encoder of the original \nlanguage model to multi-modal encoder \nactual disks are following the \nvlt5 of paper \nso \nwe concatenate the text tokens and \nalso uh with the grid of uh \nclips visual features so we \nlinearize all the visual features and we \ncan connect with the text embeddings and \nfeed all together to the part or t5 \nselect encoder so it um so the bart \nencodes on a concatenation of \nwhat it's the original input of the text \nas well as the image representation and \nthen it as it decodes you slide that \nauto aggressive mask right so it's like \niteratively decoding with the causal \nmask as they say that left to right kind \nof structure \nexactly \nso in addition to uh adapter parameters \nwe also learn a very uh like light i \nthink of one fully connect layer between \nthe clip embedding to the wires the text \nembedding so it \nmaps the visual features to the like \nwe're defining space that bar to \nunderstand super interesting so another \ndetail of this study that i was really \ninterested in is the particular data \nsets that you're using to study \nvision and language and maybe we could \nyou could take me through the data sets \nquickly and then i could tell you the \none that really stood out to me as being \nparticularly interesting yeah so \nactually we \nfocus this on we focus on like vision \nlanguage text and also video language \ntasks and mainly focus on like question \nanswering and captioning \nso for like vision language i mean image \ntext task \nwe try vqa visual question answering and \num gqa uh also question answering data \ndataset and nlbr which is a visual \nreasoning task and cocoa captions a \ncaption task and for video language \ntasks we \nwe try like two uh video question \nanswering tests and two video caption \ntasks \nso the former two are for uh tbqa and \nhow to q8 and that's the \nlater are the tvc and yc2c like caption \ntasks super cool so quickly before \ngetting into the data set i previously \nsaid it was my favorite um could you \ntell me a little bit more about the \nvisual question answering is it um is it \nmostly common sense is it like counting \ntasks like how many apples are in this \npicture or what color is the apple or \nwhat kind of questions \nis it being tasked with there's all \nkinds of questions actually actually in \nthis so the accounting problems actually \nyeah they are some counting problem and \nthere are also some \n[Music] \nlike yes no questions the most of the \ndata i guess no questions like is the \nperson's shirt the shirt on the the man \nis \nblue or something like this kind of \nproblem and there are also some open \nquestions like \nuh maybe ask \nwhat this person doing \nwhat the man left doing something like \nthis kind of open \nuh \nanswer \nquestion \nyeah but most of that he has no question \nand some other numbers like you said the \ncounting question and \nthe other outcome open ended questions \nyeah to give a little more context about \nthe dataset creation we chose the four \ntasks bqa gqa nlpr and the google \ncaption to cover the diverse aspects of \ndifferent visual language tests as you \nknow copy caption is naturally \ngenerative task and the visual reasoning \nvr is a like binary classification test \nlike a uh if the visual input and the \nlanguage corresponds or not and the \nbeginning is more like an entailment \ntask corner like basically uh where \nyou're given two or three images and the \nsentence will either entail uh be \nentailed by only one of the images or \nall the images so it's a multi-image \nplus text entailment reasoning test \nthat's super interesting and it also \nkind of facilitates the how you have \nyour output space right because if you \njust have uh zero one and intelligent \nnot entailment or neutral like three \nlabels with neutral also it you know \nit's a lot easier than having the text \ngeneration kind of supervision right \nwith how you kind of \nget the signal back how well you did on \ndoing the task yeah i think i mean that \nthat's the good part why we used uh and \nsorry to interrupt you jeremy so you can \ncontinue but i'll finish this \nintermediate answer is that uh \nhonor so you brought up a good point \nlike we basically the whole idea of \nusing vlt5 which was jaimin's icml paper \nlast year uh was this whole motivation \nthat can we \nbuild a sort of uh \nuniform model right that can handle \nyes no questions plus bounding box uh id \nselection versus captioning \nuh right versus entailment so can can \ncan there be a unified uh sort of \nuh visual encoder plus textual encoder \nplus textual decoder kind of combination \nthat can generate \nanswers ids answers captions for all \nthese tasks in the same model so that's \nwhy we've used clipbart and clipt5 \nbased on jimin's previous work as the \nfoundation of this adapter uh \npaper right the cvpr one we're talking \nabout but uh in the camera ready version \nfor cvpr you'll see on archive two that \nyelen and jimin added another model \nwhich is clip will \nwhich is at iclr this year \nand \nthat was to show that you can also get \nvery \ngood parameter efficiency and \nclose to the full fine-tuning \nperformance even when using \nstate-of-the-art discriminative vision \nand language models like clip will \nuh \nwhich maybe jam in uh \nafter finishing the data set thought you \ncan also mention the clip will part \nbriefly thanks we talked about nlpr \ncaptioning and the other page which uh \njust covered like the hqa consists of \nlike different types of questions yes no \ncounting special understanding and so on \nand uh \nyeah i think gqa came a little after the \nvqa which uh uh tries to \naddress the competitionality of the \nvisual language uh tasks so i i guess \nthe questions are \nuh generated by \nrule-based compositions \nyeah and that's my favorite data step \nthing \nthe compositional generalization thing \nis has to be the most interesting well \nit could it could be a pick for your \nmost interesting thing going on right \nnow uh so what do you think about the \nnlvr data set and the way that you can \nyou know really isolate this idea of \ndiscrete atoms that define the \nenvironments and then test novel \ncompositions of the discrete atoms and \nthis kind of symbolic logic of how you \nput together the environments to \ngenerate the vision language task \ni think conor is asking like if you have \nsome more thoughts on gqa and its \ncompositional challenges yes \nsorry about that \nno worries \nas you mentioned like uh uh i believe \nsuch a cooperational data dataset it's \nreally hard to solve with the \nlike really recent trend of uh like \nincreasing the model size and parameters \nbecause uh that compositional questions \nof \nuh like recent like large models \nuh oh so sorry like a couple of \nquestions are hard to tackle \nwhere there's a like data shortcut in \nthe \nshortcut in the reasoning process so if \nthere's a statistical like biases in the \ndata \na model will \nuh \naffect the questions based on the \num \nlike for example uh if there's a few \nquestions like how many drafts are in \nthe images and they're only the images \nwell one job in the whole data set and \nthe model will not count the draft but \nit will directly memorize the \nrelationship between the giraffe and the \nanswer one so it just uh \nyeah blindfoldedly \nanswers zero so we might need a \nfundamentally different uh like data set \nor bottle approach to \ntackle those such like compositional \nquestions \ndo you think that's related to say it's \nover fit to the background or the \ntexture of the you know the clothing or \nwhatever the thing is do you think you \ncan have say data augmentation that kind \nof disentangles the correlation from the \ncausation of what is supposed to be \ncausing the prediction of you know bird \ndeer truck and these kind of datasets do \nyou think that kind of like causal \ninference is \nthat is is a way to think about \nimproving that and do you think data \naugmentation is maybe you know a \npromising interface for \nadding that kind of causal bias to \nimages particularly \nuh i yeah i think those are promising \ndirection i'm not sure they're the only \ndirections like \nuh \nthat both both the call like inference \nuh causal modeling and the data \naccommodation have various like \nuh \nthings are similar where they try to \nsmooth out the like the \nstatistical dish \nthe restriction holes \nso \nbut \nif we try to tackle the real-world data \nset there's much much more aspects and \ncombinations to cover like we need to \ncombine the different backgrounds and \ndifferent objects and different types of \nquestions different kinds of answers and \nall these combinations can easily go to \nexponential \nyeah also \nyeah so i think \nyeah we need to \nfigure out how to \nmake this data augmentation \nmore much more efficiently and it \nreminds me of another paper i read from \nprofessor bonsol's lab is env edit it's \na way to randomize the domains for \nvision and language navigation and so \nit's kind of like this idea you've just \ndescribed the automatic domain \nrandomization it was used with openai's \nrubik's cube the way that they you know \nthey had their physics simulator and \nthey also had visual conditions and so \nthey randomized all the environment \nparameters and tried to cover the whole \ndistribution that kind of philosophy \nthat you know we can use data \naugmentation or we can construct a \nmassive data set such that we cover all \nthe distribution is do you think that \nidea is \nyou know looking still promising or like \nsomething that is feasible \nuh \nit might be an unpopular opinion but i \nbelieve the sleep like making the more \nlike \na \ngreat uh simulator is a way to go for \nlearning more \nuh a realistic data set of course it \nrequires a like really great deal like \n3d engineers but uh to deal with the \nreal world we cannot really collect all \npossible images and and not only because \nof the data set \ncreation but it also \nuh deals with copyrights and by \nand ethical issues so yeah i i strongly \nuh want to like \nuh there's a good game ai engine for ai \nyeah i think that's a fantastic \ndirection as well the \nlike the unity environments for for \nvision and language and and the \ncompositional questions of vision \nlanguage particularly because of how you \ncan uh control that kind of thing and so \nso generally on this topic of multimodal \nlearning is um is this something video i \ncan briefly mention also something about \nembedded since you brought it up so yeah \nso the idea there is more about uh sort \nof robustness and also making sure \nthat the model is not overfitting \nor with some strange background noise \nnext to someone's microphone yeah so \nbasically uh the idea there is more that \nyou have to generalize to unseen rooms \nuh right so can can the model sort of uh \nor the agent also do navigation in \nenvironments and objects and rooms and \nsurroundings that it's not seen before \nso the idea there from data augmentation \nor editing the environments is basically \nto make sure that the model is not over \nfitting to things that it's already seen \nright and it has sort of more \nregularization from that perspective uh \nand hence creating different styles of \nthe objects or changing the objects \nthemselves uh and also the style of the \nenvironments right these things can \nmake sure like you said that the model \nis not \nlatching on to certain sort of these uh \nshortcut sort of features right because \nnow it cannot like it has to work in all \nthese different variants too so that's \nsort of like a different angle \nthat \nthat kind of \nwork would need \nbut in terms of learning \ncompositionality through data \naugmentation i sort of agree with jimin \nthat \nit's not that exciting in some sense to \nlearn all possible combinations right \nand i mean in some sense it's a nice \nsort of balance between inductive \nlearning and deductive learning right uh \nlike is it like showing a lot of \nexamples and learning the rule from that \nversus being given a rule and generating \nexamples from that \nso so yeah so there's a lot of work in \ncompositionality in pure nlp \ntasks and papers too \nbut the nice example of this simulation \nengine that jaimin was referring to you \ncan see in his uh dally eval a paper \nthat i don't know if you've followed but \nwith all this recent sort of \nuh discussion of openai's new dali model \nwe had this \none of the first sort of text to image \ngeneration evaluation \nuh works which basically used \nuh jimin's uh \nend of his \nsimulator based evaluation paint skill \ndata set that has very fine grained \ncontrol on what kinds of spatial \nrelationships and counting and \ncompositionality challenges \nto create in a data set such that you \ncan actually test whether daly is \nlearning \nthose \nspecific relationships or is it just \nuh sort of creating \nan average of \neverything that it's seen in the \ntraining data \nlike can it understand uh \nthe chair left of the table versus the \ntable \nuh right versus the chair right of the \ntable and so on like all these different \ncombinations \nyeah like a blue sphere on top of a red \ncube \nyeah he's crazy \nyeah i love that general thing of um \nlike generalization testing robustness \ntesting is a particular kind of it a \ndomain shift transfer and kind of like \nthis thing of studying these pre-trained \nmodels like on the vva podcast here we \nare about building these vector search \nengines where we put these pre-trained \nmodels as embedding providers and then \nbuild them into database indexes and \nthen provide database services so like \nwe love this topic of kind of studying \nthese pre-trained models do you think \ngenerally that's kind of an \nhow do you think about that research \ndirection where say for your new paper \nyou know you're not even going to train \na model you're just going to take \nsomething off the shelf and then just \ndesign a suite of tests for it \nyeah i think that's where the this \ncurrent sort of cvpr paper we are \ndiscussing right here adapter makes uh \nsome good sense because \nas we start working or being presented \nwith all these bigger and bigger models \nuh and like you said now you want to use \nthose models but for a different \ndownstream task you \ndo not want to and also most of the time \nwill not be able to afford to \nuh sort of retrain or fully fine tune \nthe whole \nhuge model uh on your new task so that's \nwhere i think this is the future right \nwhere with just four percent one percent \nkind of parameter updates uh can you \nachieve \nalmost the same performance as uh full \nfine tuning uh and for more and more \ncomplex tasks that involve videos and \nlanguage and images and so on \nuh so to me that's sort of the \nexciting connection uh between this \npaper and \nuh what you said \nand then from the evaluation perspective \nyeah like as we were discussing uh daily \neval i mean that's sort of like a \nslightly different angle where instead \nof making \nuh these models sort of just bigger and \nbigger uh and also being excited about \nhow they look visually uh this would be \na more quantitative \nway to actually measure whether things \ngot better at certain reasoning skills \nof spatial relations or counting or \ncompositionality or biases \nuh right so so it makes things more \nquantitative and also \nbe able to compare to previous \nmodels and iterations \nand i mean eventually it would be even \nmore exciting and fruitful to put these \nevaluations \ninto the model \nuh training optimization process right \nso that \nwhile improving the model while \noptimizing the model you are \ntrying to improve these metrics right as \npart of the optimization directly but \nobviously that will become extremely \ncomputationally heavy itself \nuh which is again where things like \nparameter efficient methods \nuh come into picture \nokay that might be like one way to sort \nof \nuh combine all of these things and and \nclose the loop yeah that's a super uh \ninteresting picture you paint like very \ncomplete with the idea of having you \nhave the sparse fine-tuning it's \ncost-effective and then you have all \nthese generalization tests that you can \ndo during training and maybe open source \ntools like waste and biases might be \nsomething that pops into people's minds \nis something that's creating these like \nmassive log reports you've seen a lot of \npapers and open source code like maybe \nchecklist and nlp but yeah this idea of \nhaving all sorts of logging and \ngeneralization testing and exploring all \nkinds of different kinds of behavior so \nkind of wrapping up the podcast our \ngeneral goal with this one was to really \nhit the points and try to get the you \nknow all the technical information as \nfast as possible kind of maybe wrapping \nup uh maybe want to talk about like \nfuture plans or sort of that general \ntopic of the code and what you plan on \ndue to doing to take this kind of \ndiscovery further yeah my brief version \nand then uh \nwillian and jamin add more uh like i \nsaid i think sort of my previous answer \nconnects to this too uh that hopefully \nbeing able to \nuh scale uh this parameter efficiency \nuh to newer bigger models but also \nespecially in scenarios where you need \nuh maybe these kinds of evaluations as \nsort of part of the model in the loop \num so so so that would be an interesting \nuh future direction \nuh and also i think elin will \nprobably mention about some future \ndirections of vl adapter because the \ncbpr version uh focused more on \nmulti-modal vision and language models \nbut the adapters were still more \neffective on the language side \nso there's still a lot of work left to \nbe done in the community \non how to make the adapters also more \neffective on the visual encoder side \nso that was that's definitely one \nother uh future work \nwell super cool that's a super \ninteresting uh direction to take it \nfurther and i had so much fun learning \nmore about the vl adapter i think this \nis such a huge discovery and i generally \ni think just sort of the cost \nimplications of this are absolutely \nmassive that you can you know only need \nto fine-tune four percent of the full \nweights of clip to say down fine-tune it \ninto your downstream task for whether \nyou're working in e-commerce or you have \nsome kind of creative idea for whatever \nit is with vision and language data sets \nso thank you all so much for coming on \nthe vva podcast i really enjoyed uh \nhearing the story of this paper and all \nsorts of details about this \nthanks for having us \nyeah thank you \n[Music] \n", "type": "Video", "name": "UNC research team on VL
