{"text": "Weaviate Academy Unit 1: Hands On. \nhello and welcome back in this section we're going to get Hands-On with radiate using a client to interact with wavier instances we'll explore how to instantiate a client and dive in some examples using both rest and graphql apis to do everything from retrieving metadata to performing generative searches first let's talk about client instantiation to access your vb8 instance you'll need to create a client object with the host URL which is the location of your web 8 instance like this one shown here if authentication is enabled you'll need to provide authentication information like the waviate API key if you're using a vectrizer service like coher hugging base or open AI you'll also need to provide API keys for them after instantiating your client you can start making requests to your webiate instance for example in Python you can use the client to talk to both the rest and graphql apis note that the rest API is typically used for crud operations and retrieving metadata or the graphql API is used for queries such as retrieving data objects or exploring vectors faces below we've prepared a set of Hands-On exercises with code examples so you can try them out yourself and compare the responses to our expected responses that are also provided and when you're done with them feel free to try bearing the queries to see what happens we're really excited to have you get started with webiate and to see for yourself first hand what it can do for you and your data thanks for watching and we'll see you soon ", "type": "Video", "name": "Hello Weaviate - Hands On", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aHIAM3665c", "timestamp": "", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
