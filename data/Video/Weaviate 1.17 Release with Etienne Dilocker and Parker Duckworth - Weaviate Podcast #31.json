{"text": "Weaviate 1.17!! This is a massive release for Weaviate, debuting Replication, Hybrid Search, BM25, Faster Startup and Import ... \nhey everyone I'm super excited to host \nEddie and dylocker and Parker Duckworth \nfor the weevier 1.17 release podcast \nthese releases are always so great it \nfeels like such a celebration of \nweeviate and the hard work of the team \nto bring these new features uh into \nweviate uh so today we're mainly talking \nabout replication and hybrid search and \nuh we're also welcoming uh Parker \nDuckworth for the first time on the weba \npodcast so we'll talk about ref devec as \nwell a little bit uh so firstly Parker \nthank you so much for joining the wevia \npodcast yeah happy to be here \nawesome I think this release is just so \nspecial because uh you know we all got \ntogether in Italy and these having \neveryone in the semi-technologies team \nin the same room as our up on the \nWhiteboard at the slides and presenting \nthese new features edian can you tell us \nabout your experience with that yeah \nit's absolutely crazy so so we're a \ncompletely remote company but being \nremote doesn't mean that you can't meet \nup occasionally and this is exactly what \nwe did so we had uh 28 I think uh or 27 \nor 28 folks in in Italy in the same room \nand uh we had a demo session planned for \nthe last day of the week to to show our \nprogress and I think by that point it \nhad been about a week that I had last \nsynced up with with Parker and red one \nwho were working on the replication and \nand I was just sitting there and \nenjoying the demo and I almost get a bit \nemotional looking at the kind of \nprogress that we've made because I mean \nlike building a distributed database is \nthe first for me it's probably a first \nfor most people to do that and um seeing \nthat come together and sort of seeing \nthe the seed that that we originally \nplanted when it was a super tiny team \nand see the the team grow and and come \nthis feature come together and it I mean \nit's like it's such a such a serious \nfeature in the end basically like when \nwe started I would think like okay once \nwe have replication that is really then \nwe're in the big league then we have \nthese these high availability and \nfailover scenarios these kind of things \nand yeah seeing that happen absolutely \nunique experience can absolutely \nrecommend it go to Italy with your \ncompany \nyeah it's just an absolutely incredible \nexperience and and yeah the end at the \nlast day uh Parker and red one gave this \nincredible lecture about a replication \nso uh Parker could kind of take it away \nand uh tell us about replication yeah \nabsolutely so uh when I first started at \nthe company we had \num a milestone it was like a the last \nMilestone of the road map which was \nreplication and it seemed so far away uh \nsuch a Monumental task at the time right \nwe didn't really have anything \num \nto to support that at the time that I \njoined so you know over time we've built \ntowards replication \num for example starting with backups uh \nfirst we introduced the ability to back \nup whatever's in your weviate instance \num maybe on a single node and then that \nevolved into \ndistributed backups which allows you to \nlike backup a cluster and all of this \nwas working towards the ability to \nautomatically replicate or to support \nreplication \nand finally we were able to build on uh \nthe back of all the work that we had \ndone with backups and introduce \nreplication so it's something that we \nhad in mind the whole time throughout \nthe planning and development of backups \nwe knew that we were building towards \nreplication and so we wanted to yeah \njust build it up incrementally until we \nwe got to this point so uh the really \nfun and interesting thing is that really \nthe Capstone of the replication work uh \nI guess you could say was done in Italy \nso up to the point \num up to that point you know we I hadn't \nmet anyone in the team in person you \nknow I'm based in the US and uh the rest \nof the core team is based um in Europe \nand other other places and so \nuh getting to sit uh specifically next \nto a red one another core team member \nand work with him in person to finalize \nthis replication \num that we wanted to build was super \nsuper uh interesting and and \num they just made the whole experience \nso great so the \nthe way that we decided to implement \num replication we first looked at you \nknow the cap theorem like what \ntrade-offs do we want to make here you \nknow do we want to prioritize \nconsistency or availability or partition \ntolerance and so after discussing \num many times with the core team and and \num yeah red one and I discussing for for \na while we \num \ndecided to make the trade-off for \npartition tolerance and availability uh \nsimilar to Cassandra \num the thing with with weeviate is that \num it's \nsuper read heavy so oftentimes the use \ncase uh will be where um we'll insert \nlike a large amount of of data up front \nand maybe there will be more inserts in \nthe future but we want to prioritize uh \nread \num the availability \num so that being said \num we decided to follow a uh leaderless \num yeah replication algorithm so the \nidea is that a request will come into a \ncluster of Eva nodes and the node which \nhappens to receive the requests will be \num \nuh promoted I I guess you could say as \nthe coordinator for that request and so \num this coordinator uh also considers \nitself one of the participant nodes or \none of the um \nyeah other nodes that it needs to relay \nlike this this replicated data to so \num the coordinator will uh participate \nin like a two-phase commit with the rest \nof the nodes including itself \nso a request comes in let's say a write \nrequest for \num yeah a piece of data and then the \ncoordinator receives the request and \nsends out um a broadcast basically like \nasking every node that is part of the \nreplication replica set I guess you \ncould say um to acknowledge the request \nhas come in uh once that acknowledge one \nelse comes comes back then \num yeah the coordinator will actually \nsend out the rest uh of the notes the \ndata that it needs to actually commit or \nwrite to disk so um the advantage to \ngoing with this uh leaderless \num algorithm is that it's more flexible \nin the case of node failure we don't \nhave like a single point of failure with \nlike a leader follower \num algorithm \nso \num yeah just uh makes things more \nflexible in the event of like node \noutages and things like that \nyeah that's so interesting to hear about \nI I love learning about these new \ndatabase features in webia for example \nwhen the backups came out I had so much \nuse out of that with my research on \nsearch features because as we're \nbuilding out this beer benchmarks and \nwe're going to talk about this later \nwith hybrid search and our evaluation \nmiracle and how we're evaluating this \nthese bench these uh backups sorry have \nbeen so useful in I can upload NF Corpus \narguana sci-fi all these beer data sets \nand then just back it up restore it run \nthe tests and then you know we know our \nhybrid surge performance or whatever \nwe're evaluating them so can you help me \nunderstand further uh the use cases of \nreplication um when when people are \ngoing to need to use it yeah so the the \nbiggest one is for reliability so \ntypically with replication you want some \nkind of redundancy so for example if a \nnote goes down and this is a Parker \nalready said uh that from the \nperspective of the cap theorem where um \nprioritizing availability and partition \ntolerance and partition tolerance in a \ndistributed cluster is basically a given \nso partition tolerance of this means in \nin this case means \na connection to another node could go \ndown or the node itself could go down \nand like from the perspective of a node \nthe other node is down doesn't matter if \nit's actually down or if it just can't \nreach it so kind of a partition \ntolerance is a given and um then \navailability would mean that use cases \ncan still continue and the cool thing \nwith our application is that the \nconsistency level that the user wants is \ntunable so um some of that is going to \nbe part of 1.17 some of it is only going \nto be part of 1.18 so we're rolling this \nout in in phases basically but in phases \nthat we believe make sense so it's not \nthat one net 1.17 is like a half \nfinished feature and then it's only \ncomplete in one not 18 but basically \nwhat you get in 1.17 is is complete and \nusable and then you get new features \nthat still fall under the umbrella of of \nreplication in 1.18. \num so yeah with tunable consistency you \ncan basically say \num how much priority do I give to the \navailability of reads versus uh right so \nwith 1.17 and every ride is replicated \nto all nodes that participate in that \nparticular class so in in a sort of \nconsistency level terms that's the \nreplication level all and then every \nread or request that comes in um at \nleast for for searches uh it is the with \ndone with the consistency level of one \nso in other words to write data into the \ncluster all nodes need to be available \nbut to read data any node could go down \nbasically as long as you still have one \nand that's that's a specific \nconfiguration so in this kind of setup \nthis would work well for um for example \nfor uh search on an e-commerce \napplication so you would say like hey \nproducts are updated only once a day so \nwe only need to be able to write data \nonce every 24 hours but users need to be \nable to search 24 hours and if something \ngoes down they still need to be able to \nsearch so that will be a great use case \nfor for the kind of uh read with uh \nsorry write with high consistency and \nread flow consistency kind of cases but \nthere are others you could for example \nsay if I ride with a quorum and read \nwith a quorum then um you could tolerate \nnode failures on on both cases or you \ncould say I both write and read with \nvery little a consistency or minimal \nconsistency basically and then you could \ntolerate a lot of node failures but also \nyou could risk that data is out of sync \nso basically you have this eventual \nconsistency kind of aspect where you say \nokay for my use case I can tolerate it \nif some data is not there at some point \nbut it needs to be there later on so \nthis is the the high availability kind \nof use case which from my perspective is \nthe the most requested reason or the \nmost the biggest motivator in in \nreplication but there are others so for \nexample what you can also do is you can \nuse replication to scale your read \nthroughput so again to stick with \ne-commerce uh Black Friday let's say the \nkind of traffic that you expect on on \nBlack Friday is five times the kind of \ntraffic that you would expect during \nduring regular day or regular week you \ndon't want to provision your cluster for \nthat Peak load that you have one day of \nthe year you want to have your cluster \nsized appropriately for the rest of the \nthe year and then scale it up basically \njust for for that one or two or three \nday period And this is some things you \ncan do with replication so you could say \nmy replication factor is three for most \nof the year so I have some redundancy \nbut maybe now I scaled up to five or or \n8 or 10 or 15 because then I have 15 \nidentical replicas that could serve the \ntraffic and basically this this gets \nlinearly so 15 nodes could serve five \ntimes the traffic that three nodes could \nserve \nand finally there's another one and this \nis sort of more on the roadmap but \nthat's the the multi-data center kind of \nreplication so for regional proximity so \nyou could have two places on on Earth so \nmaybe I think we've used that before in \nagent SW graph example so let's stick \nwith that we have Frankfurt Germany and \num I don't know Boston uh USA so um if \nyou had a data center somewhere in the \nmiddle it's kind of a bad example right \nnow because we're in the middle of the \nAtlantic but that's okay let's let's \nassume there was Data Center in the \nAtlantic \num then the kind of latencies that users \nwould get would be pretty much the same \nfor the for the users in Boston and for \nthe users in Frankfurt because they have \nthe same sort of regional distance to \nthe data center but no one has a real \ngood latency because no one is close to \nthe data center so we could say let's \nmove the data center to Boston super for \nthe Boston users not so great for the \nFrankfurt users but now with multi-dc \nreplication which you could also do is \nyou could have a data center in Boston \nyou can have a data Center in in \nFrankfurt and each of those users \ncontacts the data center that's close to \nthem so they have good latencies but \nthen of course the data centers need to \nstay in sync as well and this is \nbasically the multi-data center \nreplication this is something that's not \nyet present in 1.17 also not going to be \npart of 1.18 yet but it's something that \nthe kind of architecture that we've \nchosen in vv8 that is supported by the \narchitecture so this is something that \nif you want to have it I think we have a \nfeature request ticket for it on GitHub \nalready so upload it and then we'll \nbuild it \nyeah I love how you gave the example of \nkind of the um rewrite trade-offs with \nconsistency levels when when you want to \nuse each thing when I think that's \nalways a super important thing to \nunderstand yeah the the distributed \nsystems it's so interesting to learn \nabout it reminds me of our podcast \npeople are you know for a binge on wevia \npodcast we did another podcast with Eric \nBernice and on a running Vector search \nin production and it reminds me of that \ntopic of yeah what it takes to you know \nscale out your e-commerce store so you \ncan handle Black Friday I think in \ngeneral it's so interesting um so also \nquickly I want to touch on this um this \niterative release and Eddie and you've \nrecently written a very popular blog \npost on product engineering I think now \nwould be a great time to kind of touch \non product engineering and you're \nthinking around these iterative releases \nand the general kind of philosophy \nbehind how you think about these things \nyeah so so uh for those of you who \nhaven't heard of product engineering yet \nit's kind of the the merger of product \ndecision and Engineering decision so \nit's kind of blurring the lines between \ntraditionally you might have a product \ndepartment or a product team and then \nyou have the engineering department and \nthese these parties hate each other and \nthey don't talk to each other and don't \ncollaborate \num and the in product engineering the \nideas that you you soften these \nboundaries and you have collaboration so \nin a startup to me this makes a lot of \nsense because you have small teams and \nif you have a team with like three \ndevelopers you can't afford to have a \ndedicated product manager and maybe a \ndedicated lead developer and then who's \ngoing to do the work basically they have \nlike a a manager to engineer ratio that \njust doesn't make sense so something \nthat naturally involves in those kind of \nsettings is that yeah you blur the lines \nand you maybe have an engineer who takes \nover a couple of product \nresponsibilities or maybe you have a \nproduct manager who has an engineering \nbackground and can do the the kind of \nprototyping themselves and um yeah you \nhave easier communication more \ncollaboration and have something that I \nwould say \nyeah sort of is is is more productive \nand and feels more natural and you don't \nhave these kind of artificial boundaries \nbetween the two \num for our replication release \num I mentioned that before already we're \nreally really interested in the feedback \nthat we're getting and we're really \ntrying to to provide value early but \nvalue but really value like not just \nsort of give you something half finished \nso like hey we went for a minimal uh \nimplementation so that you could have it \nsooner but don't use it because it's not \nreally meant for production and that's \nkind of not what we're trying to do but \ninstead return to say like okay what is \na combination of features that you would \nuse or what you would need to use it in \nin production and then maybe this only \nworks for 80 of use cases maybe it \ndoesn't work for the remaining 20 yet \nthat's fine because the remaining 20 \nthey'll be covered later on but that's \nno reason for us to say to the the first \n80 hey you're gonna have to wait because \nwe're only going to release it when we \nonce we have 100 covered so that's kind \nof the idea um of doing that in \niterations and of course we get the \nfeedback when something is out we well \nyeah it gives us the ability to still \npivot and for this to to sort of tie \nthis back into product engineering it's \nsuper important to have that that \nfeedback cycle and not have like \nartificial \nsteps in between where someone has to \nrelay a message from like one Department \nto another department then in the end \nyou have Engineers that never talk to \nusers \num but it's the complete opposite \nbasically like everyone in in uh the UVA \ncore team or in other teams can be a \nmember of our or not can be a member but \ntypically is a member of our public \nslacks so they communicate with \nEngineers right away and then if if new \nideas pop up through that we we discuss \nthe ideas internally and it's not like \nwell no the product manager said we're \nnot going to do that but it's more way \nmore collaborate \nyeah incredible and I think this is a \ngreat transition to start talking about \nhybrid search and our philosophy and the \noverall how we've developed it and so on \nand so maybe let me set the stage by \ndescribing what hybrid search is so uh \nhybrid search describes combining \nkeyword scoring methods with Vector \nsearch methods so let's I think we're \nall pretty familiar with the vector \nsurge part that's where we encode data \nwith machine learning models build up a \nvector index and search for the \napproximate nearest neighbors and that \nbut now let's kind of focused a little \nmore on the keyword scoring methods so \nsort of the foundational algorithm is \ntfidf term frequency inverse document \nfrequency where you score some sentence \nlike I'm super excited to welcome Ed Ian \nand Parker Duckworth to the podcast \nbased on the kind of uniqueness of these \nterms in that query with how unique it \nis to the collection of documents that I \nhave so then going from TF IDF to bm25 \nbm25 introduces this binary Independence \nmodel it's you don't count how many \ntimes the keyword is going to appear in \nthe document just whether it appears or \nnot you similarly normalize it for the \nlength of the the document so it's a bit \nof a modification to tfidf and it's \nanother way of scoring these documents \nbased on the keywords that has been \nreally successful so then we have these \ntwo uh search algorithms and so now with \nhybrid we're combining the the results \nfrom each of the lists so we're going to \ndive a little further into the rank \nfusion and then also say bm25 and the \nextension to bm25f but I want to come \nback to this um product engineering and \nEddie and I want to ask about I thought \nwith this project you did such a great \njob of leading the team this was one of \nthe projects that I've been a part of \nsince joining we V8 where there's been \nlike it's like a task force almost like \nthis is our project this is your \nresponsibility this is your \nresponsibility and then we've just kind \nof come together and it's almost \nfinished and it's so exciting so can you \ntell me about like your initial thinking \naround the development of the hybrid \nsearch Project \nyeah that's that's great to hear by the \nway that's that's really nice yeah so so \nuh for our listeners to to understand a \nbit sort of how we structure that \ninternally \num we have the core team itself which \nbasically builds vv8 which is kind of a \nlot of what we do but by far not the the \nonly thing that we do and then uh Conor \nis part of the the research team as well \nso besides um like the podcast and and \nother sort of several activities there's \nalso the the research part and what we \nconsider research and research that the \nterm research depending on what your \nbackground is this can have very \ndifferent definitions or it can be have \nvery different meanings \num but we use research in the sense that \nwe say we've identified an opportunity \nsomewhere something that we will most \nlikely want to add to alleviate but \nthere is some kind of a question that we \nneed to answer first and this question \ncould be something as simple as \nwhat is the best ux to to integrate this \ninto our apis like how would our users \nwant to use it like do we want to give \nthe user a lot of control or do we want \nto maybe abstract something so this this \ncould be a question it could be a \nquestion of how are we going to build it \nso especially in in \num so you mentioned uh rank fusion and \nthen the scorebase fusion and these \nthese terms this is basically something \nthat that you know way better than I do \nand something where we benefit so much \nfrom from um yeah having these kind of \nkind of collaborations within the \ncompany \num yeah so this sort of how do we build \nit what do we need what do we need to \nfigure out how to to be able to build it \ncould be an evaluation also something \nlike does this idea make sense like it \nlooks good on paper but what happens if \nwe try it at scale let's try it with 10K \nobjects a million objects maybe a \nbillion objects thus it does it scale \ndoes it fit into into deviate in that \nsense and this is something where hybrid \nI think early on WE identified that \nthere's an opportunity \nand um said like okay let's let's get \nstarted let's see what it is let's see \num what do we need because hybrid sort \nof in a sense you need the both the \nbuilding blocks for hybrid both The bm25 \nSurge and the the \num the vector surge you need to have \nboth Vector search obviously is kind of \nwhat bv8 is about so we can safely \nassume that we have Vector search \ncovered bm25 is something that we \ngradually started building \num it was actually TF IDF in in sort of \nsort of the the \nthe simple building block for bm25 but I \nthink from the indexing perspective it's \nactually the same or it's like one or \ntwo parameters need to additionally be \nindexed for bm25 that is something that \nwe actually had in mind in the very very \nfirst prototype that we built so we we \ndidn't have any apis for for TF IDF or \nbm25 but we had the inverted index early \non I think over over two years ago we \nadded the inverted index to to bb8 and \nit already had this this and Parker you \nmay have come across that in the in the \ncode whenever we put those buckets we \nhad like buckets for with frequency and \nwithout frequency and the word frequency \nis so basically for all the text \nproperties we We additionally uh to to \nindexing the word we also index the \nfrequency and that was in preparation \nfor that whole TF IDF pm25 step so we \nkind of knew that it might be something \nthat we want to add at some point \num but we also have to figure out like \nwhat is what is the real value of it and \num if I'm a hundred percent honest \nsomething think that that I don't know \nat this moment is Will hybrid search \nplay role five or ten years from now it \ncould easily be the case and then I I \ndon't think anyone can confidently end \ncould be the case that semantic search \njust keeps improving so much that hybrid \nsearch basically is more of a stopgap \nsolution at the moment to bridge a gap \nand in the Gap being exact keyword match \nin and out of domain search or it could \nbe that while it still improves hybrid \nsearch is just always going to be better \nbecause it's the the combination of two \nthings and this is something that that \nyeah I I don't know and I don't think \nanyone really knows but something that I \nfind super exciting and \nyeah quote quote me on this five years \nfrom now and let's see let's see how it \nturned out \nthere seems to have been quite a bit of \nBuzz about hybrid search in the \ncommunity as well I think in our our \nslack Community I often see people \nrequesting this feature or asking when \nit's going to be available or being \nexcited when they hear that it's going \nto be available soon I think uh yeah \nit's always awesome to see people asking \nfor things and then have it delivered \nthat's so cool and I think um so in \npreparation for weeviate air Eric and I \nwere coming up with a demo and I I think \nthis example of how to catch an Alaskan \npollock that query is a great example \nwhere you have the semantic meaning of \ncatch you don't mean catch a baseball \ncatch a cold you mean you know fishing \nand then Alaskan pollock which is a \nspecific keyword \nand then that kind of fusion I I think \nwhat you're saying editing is very \ninteresting about um you know will the \nvectors be able to contain that kind of \nkeyword Centric focus in the future and \nI kind of think so also especially with \nlike say the way that Colbert would \nre-rank with token representations but I \nthink in addition to that uh this rank \nFusion thing that we've been exploring \nwill be very useful I can imagine \ncombining it with the wear filter and \nnear Tech search to have this kind of \nboost so you know saying recommendation \nor sir like you're in an e-commerce \nstore again uh it's Black Friday and you \ngo for rugs and it's like you know two \nthousand dollar for a rug three thousand \ndollar for a rug and so you also want to \nhave where prices less than 300 but then \nyou want to have like the fusion where \nyou also show the extravagant for rugs \nso you could have that kind of rank \nFusion so I think that rank Fusion is a \ncore primitive of search pipelines that \nwe've explored in this particular \nfeature uh one other thing and then I \nreally want to dive into ref devec with \nParker and uh \nis this um how we've been benchmarking \nhybrid search and it comes back to the \nbackups and I \nI think this is just so exciting for the \ndevelopment of levia and our features \nand our connection to the science is \nwe've been uploading the beer benchmarks \nto eviate and we have the ndcg the \nrecall scores and I think it's just an \nincredible exciting step for us um so \nI'm kind of curious editing if I could \nask this kind of a question about like \nyour thoughts on sort of the beer \nbenchmarks and just sort of these kind \nof like academic information retrieval \nmetrics and how they play with feature \ndevelopment \nyeah so the beer Benchmark is definitely \nmore your area of expertise than the \nmine but I think this is this is exactly \nwhat makes this so great that we we now \nhave something quantifiable as well as \nopposed to to just sort of it's it \nbenchmarks are always reflective of some \nsort of scenario so you could set up in \na benchmark in a way to produce some \nkind of a result so so let's say The \nBenchmark is primarily keyword based and \nprobably a keyword-based algorithm is \ngoing to be better on it let's say it \ndoesn't care so much about \num like yeah specific unknown words but \nit matches a domain of a semantic search \nbased model then you're probably \nscrewing it towards that so so \nbenchmarks are yeah or you always need \nlike the asterisk for what what is the \nBenchmark meant to to show but \nnevertheless I mean that's not a reason \nnot to to use benchmarks like it's it's \nvery good to to be able to objectively \nsay okay a is better than b whether that \nmatches to a being better than b for a \nspecific use case that is something that \nthat users have to see for for \nthemselves so that is why it's super \nimportant to me to have both approaches \nlike the quantifiable approach but also \nthe qualitative approach where he's like \nokay an actual use case and we we have \nour customer success team who deals with \nthe the paid cases that we have uh for \nfirst semi we have the open source \nCommunity who sometimes share data or or \ngive us some insight into what's working \nfor them so the mix of both to me is \nsuper important that we don't just make \nthese claims of chair picked examples \nbut that we also don't do the opposite \nof saying like hey it's nothing is \ncherry-picked everything is scientific \nbut then the user comes in saying like \nwhy doesn't it work for me \nyeah it's absolutely fascinating \nespecially with uh I'm like kind of \ncoming into the trending topic of the \nday uh chat gbt I don't mean to distract \ntoo much but this kind of ad hoc \nevaluation I did one query I like the \nresult that means the system works \ncompared yeah and that goes both ways \nright like you see the people saying \nlike hey it's the best thing ever I only \nhave positive results and you see people \nsaying is the worst thing ever I only \nhave negative examples yeah exactly and \nI think it's \nworth kind of knowing that these systems \nare a little different than \nthe maybe traditional software cases \nwhere these Edge like machine learning \nperformance is very like long tail to \nlike hit or miss and I think the beer \nbenchmarks a particular reason why I'm \nso excited about this particular work is \nuh the diversity captured in it it has \nyou know papers about covid-19 it has \nFinancial questions like uh are my \npersonal taxes separate from my hobby \nincome and then you have like nutrition \nquestions about like are multivitamins a \nwaste of money so you have this \nincredible diversity diversity and query \nlength and I think we're also seeing the \nkind of intense this kind of \nexplorationism This research is emerging \nas well where you'd say what is the \nintent of the search task and that kind \nof expiration um so yeah overall I just \ncouldn't be more excited about the \nbenchmarking I think it's such an \nexciting step for us so I want to play \nthe topics I'm so excited to have uh \nParker especially because he uh was so \npivotal to the development of ref Parker \ncould you start by kind of explaining \nwhat ref to VEC is and then I really to \ndive into sort of some of the questions \nthat we've been seeing in our community \nchat like particularly clarifying um \nupdating the references and how this \nkind of Cascades backwards uh thinking \naround like can we have custom \naggregation functions but but maybe if \nwe could set the stage can you tell us \nabout what reftubec is \nyeah certainly so uh ref the back \ncentroid is yeah a new module that we \nreleased uh recently and uh the idea of \nit is is that \num an object which is set to be \nvectorized so to speak by rectifix \nAndroid \num a vector isn't produced by this \nobject itself but it's produced by like \nthe aggregate of its references vectors \nso uh the ref to back module will take \nan object and then grab the vectors from \nall of its references all of its \nreferenced objects and then we'll yeah \ncompute a centroid with that \num set of vectors to to to find \nsomething that's yeah similar to all of \nthese things at once and and so the idea \nis that this is really useful when you \nwant to represent something \num as an aggregation of other things \nright for example \num users uh based on their likes right \nwhat can we what can we uh show to a \nuser that is something that aligns with \nwhat their their Express interests are \nand the rest of that centroid is \nsomething that's that's perfect for \ndoing something like that yeah exactly I \nthink um the the sort of the most \nobvious use case I think is the kind of \nbipartite graph recommendation case \nwhere you have users products uh the \nuser liked a few products and now you \nrepresent the user with the uh with the \nvector from the products and then that's \nthe query Vector to recommend new \nproducts with I think that really helps \nuh just get the idea quickly um yeah I \nthink um I want to kind of stay on this \ntopic of graphs and weviate a little \nmore I have sort of my story of coming \nto weviate is um you know I when I had \nfirst talked to Bobby's it was Ted \ntalked about how he was really \ninterested in the semantic web in \nontologies and then sort of shortly \nafter we had that podcast I went to New \nYork to meet Laura at the knowledge \ngraph conference where their you know \ncompanies like tiger graph relational AI \nwhere they have these tuples and so I \nalways kind of had this thinking that \nlike we V8 is going to have this focus \non the graphs sort of opening this up \nand maybe adding you could start them \ncan you tell me about kind of the the \nmotivation behind this cross-reference \ndesign because I think it's so powerful \nso under like I don't want to say \nunderappreciated but I think it's maybe \nnot hyped enough like this kind of \ndesign of having cross-references the \nway it lets you do multi-vector the way \nit lets you do multimodal I think it's \nsuch a powerful part of the data schema \ndesign and webiate \nyeah this this goes back a bit to the \nhistory of vb8 because there was a phase \nbefore we called ourselves or before we \ncalled bv8 a vector search engine \num because we we we're sort of trying to \nfigure out like what is it that that \nthat alleviate can add or where it can \nadd the kind of value and at that point \num bb8 was no database on its own yet \nbut bb8 was sort of thought as a layer \non top of other databases and at that \npoint we're actually planning on running \nthe deviate on top of graph databases so \nwe had an integration for what's called \ngenus graph \num a tool that I had not heard before \nand also kind of haven't heard of since \nbut I think it's it's like it's a super \nNiche tool super good at what it does \nbut also like a like a relatively small \nNiche and the idea of Janna's graph was \nthat you build this itself on top of \nother databases so I think at that point \nI don't know if this is still true it \nwas uh Cassandra and \num an elasticsearch I think so sort of \nlike store the data in in Cassandra and \nthen uh query using using elasticsearch \nand and this enables you to yeah sort of \nbuild this like like super large scale \ngraphs and then vv8 was basically the AI \nlayer on top of that and originally the \nidea was was before we started yeah \nbasically accepting vectors together \nwith with objects to only vectorize the \nschema so one of the very first use \ncases was you have this these these \nknowledge graphs and they have different \nontologies so so you would have a graph \nhere any graph there and you kind of \nknow that there's an overlap but because \npeople didn't use the exact same words \nit was super difficult to to Really \nmatch like what is like in these two \ncrafts like yeah they do intersect but \nyou don't know how so the original idea \nwas to use \num yeah basically NLP technology early \nin LLP technology of the time to just \nfigure out what the right schema is and \nthen at some point Bob and I were on a \ncall and this was super early on I think \nthat the team was very very small and we \nwere kind of figuring figuring out this \nvideo like what if we tried that same \napproach not on the schema but in the \nactual data and we were both like nah \nthat's that's crazy like we can't we \ncan't do that and and then we tried I \nwas like whoa this this works kind of \nwell and that was kind of the the step \nwhere where sort of this \nsemantic graph ontology tool turned into \na vector data Vector database so we kind \nof pivoted completely and and that was \nalso the point when we started \num don't want to say rewrite vivade \nbecause some parts of it like the \ngraphql API for example still is modeled \nafter after that original structure \num but yeah it was kind of \num sort of \nShifting the focus a bit but at the same \ntime our early users already had graphs \nthat they represented with bb8 so \nthey're like okay well we can't just \nabandon them we can just say like okay \nV8 now switched from sort of this \nsemantic graph tool to a nosql document \nonly search engine and now you can't \nrepresent your graphs anymore okay uh \nvv8 is probably not going to become a \ngraph database because so if you in in \narchitecture it's always it's always \ntrade-offs I'm like what do you \nprioritize them said okay search is more \nimportant for us than than craft \nreversal so we kind of uh skewed the \narchitecture towards search so the the \nagents W index and the inverted index \nand the way it distributes data across \nnodes and these kind of things so these \nare all set up for for search but we \nsaid we want to keep the cross \nreferences and the the cross references \nfrom an architectural perspective \nthey're basically just links and and of \ncourse there's some couple of \noptimizations you can do when you \nresolve those those links \num but yeah that's that's kind of the \nthe history of why they're there and um \nand and now sort of it's it's an enabler \nfor new use cases basically \nyeah that's amazing I I've always \nwondered like the vectorized class name \nthing now makes so much more sense to me \nwith the context of that and that's so \ninteresting um so I really want to dive \ninto the technical details uh Parker \ncould you tell us about like because I \nwe're seeing this question about kind of \npeople want to understand exactly how if \nthey have a to B to C and they update C \nuh will it Cascade back like that this \nkind of question uh it seems to be \nsomething that people are curious about \nyeah absolutely So currently the um \nthe only way to update an object's \nreference Vector uh is by updating that \nobject itself the parent object which \nholds the references so let's say \num object a references object B and C \nand object A's uh Vector reference \nVector is the centroid of bnc's vectors \nuh if B or C are updated a is a \nreference Vector does not change right \nnow we don't have any sort of back \nChannel mechanism that allows that \ninformation to to reach the object which \nreferences those vectors and primarily \nuh it was because this is our first \niteration \num this is something that could be very \ncomputationally heavy if for example \num we have tons of these reference \nvectors around so uh currently the the \nonly way to update an object's reference \nVector is to update that object's set of \nreferences directly so that can be done \neither just by posting an entirely new \nobject or I guess you could say put in a \nnew object with the same ID and a new \nset of reference vectors or deleting \nsome references from that object or \nupdating that object's references one at \na time but basically the only way to \nupdate an object's reference Vector is \nto mutate that object set of references \non itself whereas updating one of its \nreferences directly is not going to \naffect that parent objects reference \nVector yeah and that idea of the kind of \nyeah when you really chain out these \ngraphs and there's kind of like the \nbipartite graph I originally designed \ndescribed where you can have like \nmultiple edges uh you maybe also have it \ngoing back and forth kind of if you \nimagine data like that but like multiple \nclasses chained together I think the \naggregate functions are going to be \nthat's going to be something that we can \nreally explore and as edian said in \nlaying the future for what we can do \nthem and maybe I even want to just work \nthis in there because I'm happy to have \ngone so last night I went to mit's \nlearning on graphs conference and it was \nfirstly yeah it was super cool to be at \nMIT it's super super smart people and \njust walking around here like nice I'm \nat MIT but like um seeing the research \nand seeing the thinking around graph \nneural networks it can be so intense \nabout this kind of thing of like what \nkind of problems can uh deep learning \nbroadly solve sort of connecting to like \nthe Turing machines and uh you know like \nwhat problems can be solved like NP \ncompleteness can graph neural networks \ntake that on but I think there's a big \nmiddle ground but for like the just a \ngraph convolutional Network being used \nsomewhere that's useful and I think just \nthis basic idea of chaining these things \ntogether aggregating maybe that could be \nthe use of that and we could similarly \nhave a python app for our module \ninference the same way we have \ntext-to-back uh you know all these \nthings we have that kind of container \nfor the like pytorch geometric Library \nso kind of pivoting and I know that the \ngraph neural network aggregation thing \nis a bit intense but can we talk about \nlike um what would it take to build in \nlike custom aggregation functions maybe \nstarting with just like having biasing \nit so that the mean centroid is uh most \nheavily impacted by the most recently \nadded cross-reference yeah currently uh \nare only uh \nare only module in the class of ref to \nvac is rough centroid this was built \npurposely to be able to be easily \nexpanded \num \nuh into more more \num centroid type algorithms or more \nalgorithms to to \num yeah calculate this reference Vector \nhowever you want to calculate it so uh \nweaving its module system is by Design \nvery modular and so if we were to want \nto introduce something like this \num \nmost of the boilerplate I guess you \ncould say the groundwork has already \nbeen set so it's just a matter of coming \nup with the way you want to calculate \nthese reference vectors and then \num introducing a new module which \npiggybacks this existing ref the back \nframework that we build within the \nweaving module system to to use this new \nalgorithm to calculate the reference \nVector so I would say \num for any reference or ref the back \ncentroid modules in the future it's \num not a whole lot of work to introduce \na new one it's just a matter of like \nfiguring out how you want to calculate \nthese these reference vectors \nyeah I'm just just sorry just thinking \nout loud \num about that that recency bias because \nI think I'm not 100 sure but basically \nreferences in vv8 have a specific order \nwe we don't ever make use of the fact \nthat they have an order but on disk \nthey're they're saved in order so most \nlikely we could use that fact we don't \nhave time stamps for for a reference so \nright now we couldn't easily do say \nsomething like okay from one to two was \na very short time difference then from \ntwo to three it was a large one but at \nleast we know the order so if we just \nwant to give the most weight to the most \nrecent one it would probably be as \nsimple as giving the most weight to the \nlast element of the array \nyeah super interesting I think um kind \nof one other thing that excites me and \nyeah that I think that the building \nblocks of that are in place and that \nwill be super impactful just basing on \nthat a little longer you imagine like \nyou want to have recommendation without \nsort of logging in and having that long \nArchive of user data you want to just be \nable to like scroll through Tick Tock or \nwhatever and like quickly have \nrecommendations I think that kind of \nthing lets you like control it with your \nby giving the signal of uh recency sort \nof one other thing that kind of excites \nme is this idea of clustering the um the \nembeddings I think that could be super \npowerful especially for diverse \ninterests \nso like if you've liked these products \nand it's like uh Nike shoes Adidas shoes \nJordan shoes I think instead of \naveraging it we could have this uh \nclustering and then the centroids could \nbe used which brings this topic of how \nmight we represent centroids like and I \nthink the cross-reference thing again is \nwe would use it again to do multi-vector \nrepresentation and that kind of idea \nso super cool I think um yeah this \noverall this is 117 and thanks so much \nfor the discussion on ref to VEC I'm so \nexcited about reftubec I think this kind \nof graph structure how we can send \nembeddings through the graphs and \naggregate them I think a lot of people \nare excited about it because I think \nit's exciting \nbut but anyways thanks so much I think \num yeah replication hybrid search and \nsort of the Italy 117 release all of it \nyeah yeah smooth a few few smaller \nimprovements as well um we'll mention \nthem in our release blog post but um a \ncouple of uh performance improvements \nregarding startup time so uh both for \nfor startup times at the time that the \napplication takes to to restart so for \nexample if there was a a node failure \nand this is something that with \nreplication we have a lot more tolerance \nfor but even with replication you still \ncare about the time that the node is \nback because there may be a time window \nwhen when it's unavailable so there are \na lot of improvements around the the \num yeah startup time but also and and \nthis was sort of similar uh a similar \ncost for this we've also improved uh \nbatch latencies and and they're \nparticularly sort of the the P99 or or \nthe max latency so we had a pretty \nconstant write speed already based on \nthe LSM store having a constant write \nspeed but then we had like these \noccasional Peaks and that those could \nlead to timeouts and then timeout would \nlead to a retry and then the retry would \nput more load on the cluster in all \nthese this kind of chain of events and \nwe have a lot of fixes around those as \nwell that we implemented in one not 17 \nwhich is sort of one of these for for me \nmy favorite category like not a very \nexciting feature but super exciting for \nthose that actually operate VBA clusters \nawesome well thanks again both so much \nfor the for coming on the podcast and \neveryone please check out weave 1.17 and \nthank you so much again for listening \nawesome thanks Connor \n", "type": "Video", "name":
