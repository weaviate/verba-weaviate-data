{"text": "Brady Neal from Oogway talks with Connor Shorten from Henry AI Labs about causal inference and many more. See the ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nchecking out the seventh episode of the \nwe vva podcast today i'm joined by one \nof the heroes in deep learning brady \nneal who has made an amazing course \nexplaining causal inference he's had \njoshua benjio come on his youtube \nchannel to explain \nthe latest ideas and things like system \none system two thinking the \nconsciousness prior and what causal \ninference might be adding to deep \nlearning brady is currently the founder \nof oogway ai a decision-making ai \nstartup and he's also a phd student at \nmila so brady thank you so much for \ncoming on this podcast thanks for having \nme connor so to kind of tip it off could \nwe get into just right away what is \ncausal inference and what does it add to \ndeep learning yeah so so cause of \nimprint is essentially you're trying to \ninfer the effects of your actions what \nare your actions causing \nand i guess the way it can be related to \ndeep learning is so they're not \nnecessarily \ncompeting so you can use deep learning \nin causal inference there's a basically \nyou you might use machine learning \nmodels to help you do causal inference \nand deep learning models are \nour good kind of machine learning model \num and then there's also some insights \nfor how \ncausal inference can help out with \ntopics that deep learning people care \nabout so for example \ndeep learning people care a lot about \nout of distribution generalization or or \ncompositionality uh \nthat kind of stuff and and there's some \ncausal inference insights that that can \nhelp out there so could we start with \nthis idea of um of compositional \ngeneralization and causal inference is \nthis \nwhere so say um we've seen things like \ndisentangled representations or say \nyou're trying to \nhave that low dimensional vector \nrepresentation be interpretable as high \nlevel variables and maybe you're trying \nto draw \ncausal pathways between these high level \nvariables is that kind of \nthe thinking around what causal \ninference brings to that kind of \ndimension of you can compose novel \nconfigurations of the high level \nvariables and then having say the \nuh directed acyclic graph pathways \nhelps you helps you like structure the \ncompositional testing is that the right \nway of thinking about it yeah i think \nthat's i think that's very good way of \nthinking about it so like one way a lot \nof \npeople or at least maybe a few years ago \nyou would think about disentanglement \nwas this sort of statistical \nindependence between these variables \nright that means that these variables \nare independent they don't they don't \naffect each other at all \num \nwhich is \nwhich is like kind of weird if you if \nyou think about objects in a scene and \nyou see \nlike two balls and and one hits the \nother \nthey it affects it it affects that one \num so yeah i think it it makes more \nsense to think about disentanglement as \nyou're kind of you're disentangling out \nthe factors in this causal graph so like \none ball and two balls in the scene then \nmaybe there's like a background or \nsomething in the scene and then you can \nyou can draw arrows for which ones \naffect each other and which ones don't \nand such yeah but so yeah i think that's \na good view of disentanglement is \nfiguring out the causal graph and the \nvariables in the graph \nso do you think um so say with these uh \ngenerative adversarial network \narchitectures how we have a random noise \nsaying like the um the latest style gan \nframework they start off from a fixed \nrepresentation and then you have the \nrandom noise that comes into the pathway \nand it hits those intermediate kind of \nlayers is that a good example of say \nthese this unobserved phenomenon that \nyou model in causal inference where say \nwith these randomized control trial \ndiagrams how you have some \nunobserved factor of variation that you \nkind of work into the model is that \nsimilar to injecting noise and \nintermediate activations for deep neural \nnetworks \nyeah okay so i'm not sure so so this \nthis recent style again thing i'm \nprobably not familiar with it but i can \ni can imagine what you're talking about \ninjecting noise into layers of the \nnetwork \nuh \nthat almost to me is almost like you \nknow you have this function that you're \nlearning \nand you're \nyou're like injecting noise in parts of \nthe function that that's how like i \nthink of that \nyeah so i don't know if i'm familiar \nenough with it but but if people haven't \nlike \nexplicitly stated that they're trying to \ncapture causal relationships \nand and stated it in more than a way \nlike an nlp you see \nthe phrase causal \nlanguage modeling that doesn't that \ndoesn't mean like what we mean in causal \ninference that just means they're they \nhave like ordering to \nthe stuff but so yeah if they haven't \nsaid it say it that way then i'm \nguessing they're not trying to \ncapture causal relationships \nyeah we are familiar with with the this \nrecent style game thing \ncan we stay on this um this causal \nlanguage modeling that you just \nmentioned seeing that so what it what is \nthe um so i guess the current thinking \nis because you're using the leftmost \ncontext to predict the rightmost mass \ntoken you say it's \ncausally the left is causing the \nprediction of the right but is that \nmaybe not a honest interpretation of \ncause of that causal phrase yeah well i \nget i get how people like people read \nfrom left to right so i guess \ni guess i can see how they're thinking \nabout it as causal right like um \nas you're reading from left to right \nyour brain might be predicting the next \nwords or something and \nthose words that's predicting our \nfunction of the previous words because \nyou're reading from left to right so \nit's like causing you to predict the \nnext words uh in your brain \nbut \nin terms of objects in a story \nyou know it might be that the the causes \nmentioned later in the sentence where \nthe effect is mentioned earlier so is so \nis that more akin to say like named \nentity recognition not like named entity \nrecognition but that task of \nuh assigning labels to each token so you \nwould say label this token as a cause \ntoken and an effect token is that would \nthat be like a more \nway to bridge the gap between nlp and \ncausal inference yeah yeah i guess uh \nyeah that could make sense you train a \nnamed entity recognizer thing \nto \nyeah to get the cause and the effect \nit's um \nyeah and then you have a data set right \nwhere you try to where you try to \ndo that that could make sense \nyou would have to have a model that \nlooks both ways right you wouldn't you \nactually wouldn't want to have a causal \nuh language model i guess right you \nwould want it to be able to have the \nfuture and the the past context and the \nsentence so once you have the cause and \neffect labeling \nshould you \nmap these tokens into one of these \nsymbolic dag graphs that \nlike would distilling your model's \npredictions into one of these graphs be \nsomething that can maybe facilitate \nexplainability and then want to go and \nget into counterfactuals next but do you \nthink that kind of distillation between \nuh maybe if you first fit your training \ndata set and then uh on your maybe even \njust within the same training data set \nyou go from \nthe cause effect labeling and you \ndistill what it's predicting or what the \nrepresentations it's learned into these \nsymbolic dags and then the dag is the \nthing that you \nrun inference with because you can look \nat it and say okay i can see the \npathways that are causing this \nprediction yeah so so i actually haven't \nthere are people who do research \non um \ncausality in text \num but \ni'm not that familiar with it and i \nthink a lot of it ends up being like \nsort of propaganda um \nkind of research right like how \neffective was \nactually yeah i don't know i'm not \ntotally sure on that stuff but uh \nbut yes you could you could take text \nand then try to \nuh figure out what are the variable like \nthe relevant variables that you \nthat make sense to attend to and then \nthose are your variables in this causal \ngraph and \nand you could model causal relationships \ndescribed in the text \ni'm i've never done something like that \nbefore but i could see someone do maybe \nthere's a paper that does that kind of \nstuff \nin terms of explainability like causal \ngraphs i definitely think aid \nexplainability \nyou know like any time someone's asking \na why question \num \nyou you could potentially reframe it as \nlike what caused \nthis \nyou know there's a why this well what \ncaused this and um \nso causal grafts you know you can have \nthe the thing that you're trying to \nexplain \nand then there's these proximate causes \nthe things that are closest to it that \nhave caused it \nand then \nfurther down in the causal chain there's \nthings that cause those proximate causes \nright and so the the freight i'm just \nusing uh terminology here in case people \nwant to google it but there's \napproximate and then there's like \nultimate causes \nwhere um \nit's essentially that's the stuff at the \nvery beginning of the call of chain but \nyou know usually you can take causal \nchains very far \nfar back \num \nand yeah so \nuh i kind of lost where i was going with \nthat oh explainability right it was \nunexplainability and so you can discuss \nexplainability at various layers in the \nthe graph you know you can discuss it \nwell here was ten days ago \nuh versus here was like one day ago so \nsay you're trying to \nexplain covid covid stuff you know then \nthose time ranges uh there's different \ntime ranges that make sense to look at \nand stuff so i've seen a lot of \ninteresting things on say unifying \nstructured and unstructured data where \nwhat you do is say you go through the \ntable and you parse it into natural \nlanguage do you think going through so \nyou learn you create some kind of causal \nstructure with the approximate and \nultimate causes you think maybe \nhaving some kind of parser that turns \nthose into natural language phrases and \nthen just go ahead and language model \nthose phrases do you think that kind of \ndistillation of from the causal model \nto the \nlanguage model could be a useful path so \nis it uh let me make sure i try to \nunderstand so you start with a causal \nmodel and then you want to produce some \nlanguage thing what is the point of \nlanguage thing is it to like explain the \ncausal model or \nyeah so so you maybe um traverse it and \nthen annotate and then \nsay like um x had this impact on a which \ncaused this impact on b and you but then \nyou phrase it as a natural language \nsequence and just add it to the training \ndata \ni i see so you have someone cause a \nmodel and you could potentially generate \nmany different sentences \nthat follow that model like uh right \nlike these it's like having a grammar i \nguess and they're generating a bunch of \nstuff that follows the grammar yeah that \nmakes sense and you could use that as uh \nas as data so so in this kind of thing \nwe're talking about now i think mostly \num trying to understand how we go from \nmaybe this kind of idea of observational \ncausal inference where we try to \ndiscover causal structure in say an \ninternet scrape of text data and then \nthere's kind of like i guess the \nexperimentation side of causal inference \nand you touched on that quickly this \nidea of text is treatment and i've seen \nthese papers where say um \nlike the propaganda studies where \nthey're they're studying how different \nways that you um \nthe different styles of text that you \nuse to present news the the impact of \nthat is a treatment so it's like a b \ntesting but directly using text and \nrepresentations of text \nto be the uh to be the treatment have \nyou seen these kind of studies and do \nyou think that kind of stuff is \ninteresting yeah yeah there's a word for \nthis right like there's some phrase \nwhere it's like you frame it uh this way \nand then people \noverwhelmingly answer yes and then you \nframe it a different a slightly \ndifferent way but it's the same meaning \nand people overwhelmingly answer no i \nfigure what the phrase is for that \nthere's some term uh in like uh \npsychology for this \nanyway but yeah that stuff's really \ninteresting right they're essentially \ndoing an experiment \nwhere what they've held constant \nis the meaning of the the \nsay they're doing a survey they've held \nconstant the the meaning of the survey \nquestion \num which is like controlling for factors \nright causal influence roughly you could \nthink of as just \ncontrolling for factors you've people \nhave probably heard that phrase before \nmaybe doing it in a fancy way but it's \ncontrolling for factors so they're \nthey've controlled for the meaning \nthey've held that constant and then \nthey're just changing the phrasing so \nthe idea is \njust the phrasing is enough to have very \ndifferent impacts on people's uh \npsychology right their understanding of \nthe question or of the statement \nso so with that idea of trying to you \nknow use the causal inference to take \naction and use a particular kind of text \nto influence people or whatever whatever \nthe um the setting is what's the \ndifference between \nstructuring that as a causal inference \nproblem or structuring that as a \nreinforcement learning problem yeah well \nso \nso i haven't \nthought a ton about the relationship but \ni've thought a little bit right so \nreinforcement learning you're you're \nessentially trying to figure out what \nactions you can take to maximize reward \num you know whatever or utility whatever \nyour uh the thing that you want right \nand in causal inference you're kind of \ndoing the same thing right you have some \noutcome that you care about and you're \ntrying to \nget the best outcome you're trying to \nyou're trying to \nwell if you're doing it prescriptively \nif you're doing causal inference decide \nwhat action to take like what decision \nto make \nthen you're trying to \nfigure out which \nuh action take to take the best out to \nget the best outcome \nand i guess it's just that in \nreinforcement learning it's more \nyou have all these trials where you can \nlike experiment a bunch maybe in \ncontinual learning where it's like only \none \none go right you when you die it's it's \nthe end it's it's a little bit different \nbut in reinforcement learning in normal \nyou have so many trials you can die \ninfinitely many times so you can really \ntest out like everything given enough \ntime \nand so i guess causal inference you \nmaybe you could view it as like \ntrying to be a bit more efficient with \nthe actions you try out and how what is \nthe information you're using that using \nto do that it's like \nthinking about the causal structure of \nthe problem what are the factors \nthat could be confounding um \nmy actions and outcome and and that i \nneed to control for \nto \nget a better guess at what action might \nbe the best action \nat a given point yeah it makes me think \nabout say model-based reinforcement \nlearning where you're trying to learn \nthe transition dynamics as well as how \nto act in it \nand \ni think maybe with the causal structure \nto learning your \nworld model is more uh like you have the \nexplainability you have the high level \nvariable compress compression \nbut then you still kind of need to go \nfrom the high dimensional observations \ninto the high level variable space right \nso maybe things like self-supervised \nlearning and how they say one paper is \ncurl where they do contrast to \nself-supervised learning with the \nobservations to try to facilitate that \nrepresentation and then from there we \ncan maybe construct these \nvariable models for our dynamics and our \ntransition models so \nonce you have these \ntransition models \ncan you just \nunroll a counter factual by just \nyou know the proposing some kind of \naction or is it because it's out of the \ndistribution space that the model is \njust gonna compounding error and maybe \ncausal inference adds something to that \nidea of counterfactually querying your \nlearned transition model yeah so kind of \nfactual share being like \num what would \nthe \nor or even maybe potential outcome is a \nis a more intuitive word in this context \nlike what would the \nthe \nresult be if i were to take a given \naction \nyou know the potential or what would the \noutcome be what was the potential \noutcome \nso yeah if you have a perfect model of \nthe world you can just run the dynamics \nof that model \nand change the different actions and \nyou'll see which actions will produce um \nbetter things and that's like that's \nbasically what reinforcement learning \ndoes \nyeah when it's run in a simulator where \nthe simulator is taken as the as the \nworld they basically have that um \nyeah and then counterfactual just to \nclarify some terminology a little bit \nlike when i use counterfact people use \nprimary engineering differently when i \nuse counter factual it's like \nso you start off with two potential \ninfinitely many potential outcomes as \nmany actions as you have that you have a \npotential outcome for each one of those \nactions \nand then once you take an action like um \nuh say i take a pill \nthen i realized that potential outcome \nthe outcome when i take the pill and \nthen the other action like don't take \nthe pill becomes a counterfactual right \nso uh \nit's counter to fact i can no longer \nobserve it unless \nunless you have a model of the world \nright so we actually uh i have a blog \npost on this so \na blog post and a paper so you um if you \nhave the the model of the world then you \ncan observe all counterfactuals \nbecause you just run through your model \nyeah i blog post on this and then \nthere's a paper called real cause \nthat helps people essentially observe \ncounter factuals and there's there's \nvarious work where people use deep \nlearning to try to \ntry to get at counterfactuals \nso maybe from this um one of the early \nexamples in your course of uh sleeping \nwith your shoes on and that leading to \nwhether you're woken up hungover or not \nor whether it's really because you've \nbeen drinking \nif if you unroll those into sequence so \nit's like several of these decisions can \nyou take me through what it takes to \ngeneralize that kind of \nthinking into \nyou know you have five potential like \nit's not just shoes or drinking it's \ni don't know whatever whatever leads to \ngoing out like call from your friend or \nsomething like that yeah okay so you're \ntalking about a sequence of actions and \nthen the okay so say you have a sequence \nof actions and then the outcome \nis uh whether you wake up with a \nheadache or not \nuh \nyeah yeah so \num \nso for people \nunfamiliar with this example it's just \nlike the idea is that you you notice \nthat um \npeople who go to sleep with their shoes \non often wake up with headaches so \nit must be that uh when you sleep with \nyour shoes on they cause you to have a \nheadache \ni like amusing examples is why i chose \nthat example but but you know it's \nreally just there's some confounder \nuh that's causing both of them which is \nlike you went to sleep \nuh drinking and so okay so you're \ntalking about \nthat's one action is a go to sleep \ndrinking but maybe there were actions \nthat preceded that one \nyeah so \nyes you could think about essentially \nlike like the picture i have in my head \nis it is a tree right \num like weight but y has this nice tree \ndiagram \nwhere so like this is you at a given \npoint in time \nand then \nthis is one path of actions that's where \nyou would end up this is another path of \nactions another path \nand you can view it as like a tree of \nmany paths branching out every time you \ntake an action \nand then \nso in that example you kind of \nfollowed one path \nthat ended up at going to sleep drinking \nbut you could you could follow other \npaths there \num and each \nyou know it's like the butterfly effect \nthing right where uh \none thing a long ago could have a \noutsized effect on let's say \nwhether you wake up with a headache or \nnot right like um \nif you decide to \ntake a nap in the middle of the day or \nor maybe no maybe that's a bad one \ni don't know \nanyway uh \nif you get put into a coma right then \nyou're not gonna wake up with a headache \nuh because you got put in a coma a year \nago and it's like a long coma so uh so \nthat kind of reminds me of say the um \nlike the mu0 monte carlo tree search of \nrolling out several pathways and then \ntrying to pick from the pathways and \nto me that's kind of an interesting \nexample of a neurosymbolic ai system \nwhere the monte carlo research rollout \nis like a symbolic program that you \nlayer on top of your \nneural program do you think causal \ninference is like the way to bridge \nthese \nneural predictions with some kind of \nsymbolic reasoner and is that kind of \nthe maybe the best way to be \napplying it in with the current state of \ndeep learning tools um \ni think that if you ask a lot of causal \ninference people uh they'll say yes \nbut you know pete whatever people are \nmost familiar with is the is the tools \nthat they want to use \nso i mean causal inference is useful for \num \njust when you're trying to \ninfer effects of actions \nand \nyou don't already know those effects \nright like if you have a simulator or a \naccurate model of the world which is \nlike very hard to have right but if you \nwere to have that then you don't need \ncausal inference really or i mean \nyou could say that the causal inference \nis just \nrunning the \nthing through your world model \nthat's that's you doing causal inference \nand you've kind of \nyou've kind of \npre-done all the work of adjusting for \nconfounders by building that world model \ni guess \num \nbut yeah so so always the question is \nshould we use \ncausal inference to build up that tree \nyes so the question is just kind of \nabout this again this bridging between \njust neural predictions and then some \nkind of symbolic program and i'm \nthinking about whether it's about uh \njust this general concept of distilling \nyour representations into this kind of \ntree so \ni don't know whether you can and and \nthen the the connection of because you \nknow the um the connection between a to \nb or like did i drink beer last night \ndid i uh \nuh take a nap in the middle of the day \nwith these vectors it seems also kind of \nhard to connect them \ni'm kind of just trying to imagine this \nhow to how to construct these causal \ninference pathways from these vectors \nand then how to kind of traverse \npotential causal pathways when you're \ntrying to \nuh yeah like trying to make an inference \non your learned world model or you're \nstill kind of building it i guess yeah \nwell \nokay so i'll try to separate a few \ndifferent parts of causality out \nso \nsay you \nyou know you a causal graph right \nvariables and arrows connecting the \nvariables saying which variables \ncause each other that's the kind of \npicture to have in mind \num learning the edges or the arrows of \nthe graph \nlike what causes what is called causal \ndiscovery and machine learning people \nhave been mainly doing a lot of the work \nin this right but it they've been doing \na lot of work \num whenever you have experiments it \nmakes it way easier whenever you can do \nexperiments like \nin gene regulatory networks right so \ngenes interact with each other to \nproduce \nto express themselves in your \nuh phenotype you'd write like uh just \nhow you look or whatever right something \nthat actually comes out into the real \nworld \nand uh that people do tons of \nexperiments there that helps a lot with \ndiscovering which genes cause each other \nokay but \nstarting with like implicit in that was \nthat we already know what was a gene \nlike we knew the variables in the graph \nand so the keyword there \nis kind of new so i call it causal \nrepresentation learning there might be \none or two other names for it \num \nthere's definitely one or two other \nnames for it like uh eberhardt is the \nlast name of like one of his students is \none of the first people who started \nwriting stuff on this \num that's like learning the variables \nright \nwhich you could think of as the \ndisentanglement problem \nif you think about it from causal graph \nand um yeah so i that's a that's like an \nemerging area of research mila there's a \nfew people at mila who are actually \ndoing a lot of work on that or they used \nto be amelia when they graduated \nand um \nyeah so that's something i'd recommend \npeople doing research interested in like \na frontier of research they should check \nthat out but essentially you could yeah \nyou could learn that whole graph \nbut then there's not just the variables \nand the edges it's what are the \nfunctions that map from \nvariables to edges right so the causal \nmechanisms \nis what they're called \nand that's where you know like it's nice \nto use deep learning right so it's like \nyou essentially fit \nfor every \nfor every node all of its parents in the \ngraph \nthat's a function \nfor mapping that's like the inputs to \nthe output \nand you can fit deep learning models \nthere and stuff and and so essentially \nyou could learn all of that \nlearn causal representation learning so \nto learn the variables \nlearn the \nedges and then learn the mechanisms \nand then that would give you a world \nmodel essentially \nand that you could run any \nquestion through like any uh kind of \nfactual and stuff if you have all of the \nvariables right so then that's where no \nyou you end up having like noise so you \nyou model some stuff as like this is \nunobserved noise um \nideally there's not confounding \nlike unobserved confounding \nthat's that's where uh things get tough \nto do causal inference when there's \nunobserved confounding so i want to get \na little more into unobserved \nconfounding but but quickly just to \nbecause i need this understanding of \nis what's the difference between \nmodeling the parents as a conditional \nprobability distribution compared to \nthis uh do calculus idea yeah so for \nthese causal mechanisms you could think \nof them as just conditional probability \ndistributions or you could think of them \nas \nconditional probability but you put the \nword do \nin one of the find the conditioning bar \nfor some of the variables right and do \nthere is meant to mean \nwhat would happen if i were to intervene \non this variable like i were to \nphysically set it to that thing \nand okay so how is it different from a \nconditional probability distribution \nwell \nin regular distributions you're not \nintervening on things you're just given \na data set you're just observing some \ndata \nand then you can \nyou know through like bayes rule or \nwhatever probability stuff you can \ncompute conditional probability \ndistributions \num \nright so it's really like the do \nthe do operator is the more intuitive \nthing i think to humans uh we think \nabout intervening on things and it's \nactually the conditional probability \nthing that's \num less intuitive like that's where \npeople \nuh \nthat's why confounding is so important \nbecause it it will \nconfounding will affect conditional \nprobabilities like they won't do \nwhat you intuitively think they do the \nconditional probabilities but then um \nif you have a a do behind the do \noperator like do change this action to \nthis action it will do what you \nintuitively think it do like it'll be \nmeasuring what would happen if i were to \ntake this action \nand and so do calculus i mean is a very \ncomplicated thing right so do calculus \nis like \nhow do you get from conditional \nprobabilities \nto putting do operators in there you \nknow because it's like well all we \nobserve is conditional problems we just \nobserve \ndata we can't say we're not allowed to \ntake actions how do we get to \nthe \nwhat calculations do we need to do to \nget to the things where we're saying if \ni were to take this action this would \nhappen and that's where do calculus \ncomes in \nthat's where causal graphs come in to \ntry to \nuh kind of inform how you would do the \ndo calculus it's just like a sequence of \noperations \num \nyeah do calculus is very fancy so it's \nlike that's the most \nuh \ngeneral way to adjust for variables \nso you it can produce many different \nalgorithms do calculus can \nso at a at a basic level would i if say \ni just introduced a second conditioning \nvariable like a binary do variable and \ni'm conditioning on that additional zero \none do variable and maybe that \nconditioning \ncould be injected and say like uh the \ngain and the scale and shift parameters \nof batch normalization to like \nto like shift the distribution such that \nyou kind of \nknow that you're um doing and and have \nmore layers of control integrated \nwhether it's like other kinds of \nnormalization schemes to just let this \ndo conditioning variable have more \ncontrol would like a \nlike a binary do conditioning variable \nwould that be something that would maybe \nbe useful for say like um \nsay it's like a reinforcement learning \nagent and you're trying to again learn \nthis transition dynamics model as say \nyou're just um in like an atari game and \nyou're saying i'm gonna do \nhit left for like four turns in a row to \nsee what that how that changes my visual \nobservations \nwould that additional conditioning \nvariable be enough to \nsort of simulate the impact of of \ndeliberate action \nyeah well so if you can \nactually \nyeah and and so it does get a little bit \nconfusing and do calculate or in judah \npearl's notation right the guy who made \ndo calculus with his with his students \num \nit does get a little bit confusing that \nhe uses do um \nbehind the conditioning bar \nbut you could think of that as like a \ntotally separate probability \ndistribution like think of the the do \nthing as in like the subscript of the \nprobability distribution that's that's \nmaybe a more um \nnice way to think about it and so it's \nlike they're separate distributions but \none is \nwhat you would get if you just observed \nthe distribution you have right away and \nthen i think the thing you're talking \nabout is well what if i go and change \nthe program or the simulator or whatever \nand i add in this \nthis parameter that allows me to to \nchange it to um like actually i can \nactually intervene on that parameter \nand those are like two different \ndistributions right so so one is like \nwhere you haven't done anything with \nthat parameter another one is when \nyou've changed it to \nto zero or you've changed it to one \num well maybe one of those is the same \nas uh when you haven't done anything but \nthose are basically different \ndistributions and they reflect \nwhat would happen in under two different \nconditions when you \ndo that intervention or you don't do \nthat intervention \nand so when you can do that then causal \ninference is easy right all you do \nis just run the experiment \nyou know you don't have to do any \nadjusting for anything because \nyou have access to the the world model \nessentially and you can you can just run \nthe experiment \nso in another kind of sense of these \nworld models and kind of transitioning a \nbit to say \nso say with \ncoming back to text data say we know \nthings like negations if you insert a \nnot it should flip the label or \nsay named entity swapping if you say \nsome specific fact about chicago and you \nswipe chicago with dallas you know that \nthe faction like the question answering \nsystem shouldn't produce the same answer \ncan we use these kind of data \naugmentation \ninterfaces as our kind of intervention \ntool where \nsay our simulator now has the knowledge \nthat if you \ninsert negations or if you swipe \nentities and the kind of things that are \nincluded in say like a \nlike a checklist kind of system for \ndeploying an nlp model and just \nbenchmarking its robustness can we use \nthose interfaces to \nexplore causal interventions in our \nin our text data okay so you you have a \nlike is it like a grammar where you can \nput a not in front of things and then \nthat produces a different sentence or it \nproduces a different meaning \nyeah and i think that's that is a good \nway of thinking about it just like these \ngrammars and just the formal languages \nand the kind of idea that you have this \nkind of precomputed dictionary of how it \nshould flip the label \nbut i guess that would be abstracted to \nthe agent so the agent doesn't see this \ngrammar \nit just starts uh it just starts \nperturbing the original text sequences \nand the grammar flips the label when \nit's when it has flipped the label so so \nyour agent isn't exposed to the grammar \nit's but the grammar is doing the label \nswitching that the agent is can \nhopefully do the causal discovery of the \nrelationship relationships between the \nwords because \nas it say inserts not and then the \ngrammar flips the label \nmaybe that could inform it on \nthe relationships between the whole part \nof the text sequence \nso so the agent is allowed to say like \nhey i want to put a not here and then \nand then it can observe what the label \nuh \nyeah like that kind of strategy \nyeah well so basically it's like um \nagents allowed to run that you're giving \nthem access to a certain kind of \nexperiment right like where they can \nso so they're always observing this this \nlabel and then you're giving them access \nto a kind of action like where they can \nadd this not not to things and then see \nwhat happens yeah and so \nif the agent doesn't know the rules of \nthe grammar uh it needs to learn those \nfrom taking actions right \nuh if you could just tell it the rules \nright you could encode it that that's \nnot the deep learning way but uh if you \nwere to tell it the rules then it would \nhave that knowledge too but um but yeah \ni can learn it from uh experiments \nand that's uh just generally like to \ngeneralize a bit like that is a thing \nwhere um \nyou're trying to learn causal graphs \nor you know or something else well yeah \ndoes it say causal graphs from \nperforming experiments and people come \nup with algorithms for that \nyeah so like in reinforcement learning \nyou're trying to learn \nyou know \nwhat what actions to take to maximize \nyour your utility \nuh so it's a little bit different like \nthat the objectives of the thing but \nthen just to come back to something \nearlier it could be that learning the \ncausal graph like this is kind of one of \nthe hypotheses of model-based \nreinforcement learning is that learning \nto cause a graph or some some world \nmodel actually will help you uh with \nyour utility objective which \nas humans feels like intuitive that that \nthat should help right it's but it might \nbe it's hard to engineer that kind of \nstuff so one other topic in kind of \ncoming coming away from uh the world \nmodels and data augmentation and the \nidea of learning interventions and \nproducing counterfactual predictions \nthrough these world models is i was \ncurious about this idea on whether you \ncan use causal inference to distill the \ncomplex pathways of these giant deep \nneural networks is \nis there a way that we can kind of we \nhave say 20 layers of computation and \nyou know they're wide and there's all \nsorts of things going on could we kind \nof do causal structurally causal \nstructure discovery within these \nactivation graphs of these big deep \nneural networks to kind of compress it \ninto \nlike symbols that kind of explain why \nit's making its predictions yeah i mean \nuh \ni don't know is the answer right but uh \nlike that certainly it would be a cool \nthing right so people who say they need \nto be able to understand the neural \nnetwork better \nand they don't they're not \neither they don't know about or they're \nnot satisfied with just like perturbing \nthe inputs and seeing how it you know \nsensitivity analysis preterm inputs and \nseeing how it changes the outputs \num like um \nwhat are the there's a few tools a few \ntools that do this uh \ni forget what they're called \nso it's like for any black box function \nthey'll do a sensitivity analysis and \ntry to give you some interpretable \nresults \ndo you know the things i'm talking about \nuh i've heard of a technique i think the \nmost famous one is called lime \nyes lime and then shap and uh \nyeah okay yeah so those things so if \nyou're not if you're not satisfied with \nthose things right but you want to get \nyou you essentially want to like hey \nhere's a neural network it has all this \nwe've taken all this information from \nour data set and injected it into the \nweights of the neural network \num great now the neural network's useful \nbut like i want to understand um \ni want to you know i see the data and i \nsee stuff now i want to go and look at \nthe neural network and see that same \nstuff like pull the objects out of the \nneural network and stuff \num yeah i'm not sure if someone's tried \nto do something like that but yeah maybe \nit's like rather than learning doing rep \ncalls or representation learning on a \ndata set you're doing it on a on a \nneural network right like \nyou could view the two as similar right \nthere you're basically trying to pump \ninformation from your data set into your \nneural network over the course of \ntraining \nyeah that'd be cool i i that would be a \nvery cool thing to to do \nit sounds like a cool idea yeah that \nkind of idea of like abstracting it into \nit's you're \nlike say the teacher student and the \nstudent is like the inference network \nand the teacher has like information \nabout the student network maybe it's \nused to train it has been the most \ncommon thing like meta pseudo labels \nteaching with commentaries \nmassive lists where the teacher is \nlabeling the data or \naugmenting it or doing something but the \nidea that the teacher has the \ncompressed causal structure of the \nstudent and is used for that kind of \ninterpretability so i think we've \ntouched on a lot of interesting topics \naround causal inference and i think we \ncould go on and on about all these \ndifferent things and thinking about what \nit might add to deep learning but i'm \nreally curious about oogway ai can you \ngive me the overview of what it's about \nyeah well and so to draw a line from \ncalled inference to boogway so to ugly \nis about helping people make better \ndecisions \nand the the line there is is i think \nsomething that i mentioned earlier it's \nbasically just \num \nthe decision that you want to make is is \none that will give you the best outcome \num well at least for me \num \nand you know anyone could say what their \noutcome is right people could have \ndifferent \nideas for what is the best \nand um so causal inference helps you \nfigure out what will what action will \nlead to the best outcome right \nanyway so yeah so oogway is about uh \nhelping people make better decisions and \nand essentially like so so where people \nhere there's like a an app for um \ni guess a consumer app \nthat we're building that will help with \nthat and and uh it's supposed to be for \nall decisions right so i know that \nsounds \nlike academics will use the word \nambitious right which is a which is \nnegative \ni think to say \num but yeah so so we have some ideas \nabout how to actually uh \nmake this feasible \nuh which i can get into \nand uh but one other cool thing about \noogwa is just where um \nlike i call it company 2.0 i think \nthere's going to be a next generation of \norganizations \ncoming \nwhere you know basically when the the \nconcept of a company was invented i \ndon't know like 1700s or 1500s whatever \nthat was \nyou know we could kind of take it for \ngranted now but it was a really \nuh valuable concept that produced lots \nof value for the world \nand i think that it might be the case \nthat we're getting to uh the next \nlevel of that concept \nlike say company 2.0 which i can talk \nmore about \nand so uber is trying to be one of those \nearly \norganizations that are like that and \nthe idea is like \nit would be cool if everyone could feel \nlike they're not wasting their time very \nmuch \nuh you know they're trying to they're \nactually like maximizing the amount of \nvalue they're they're producing um from \ntheir time maximizing \nuh their interest and what they're doing \nlike people who want to learn new skills \ncan go and learn new skills and uh \nand just generally like people care much \nmore about empowerment in our generation \nthan like one or two generations ago or \nsorry fulfillment \nuh \nbeing fulfilled self-actualized so \ni think that there are some tools that \ncan help a lot with that in this next \nif this is the next generation of \ncompanies \nand so who is trying to to have all that \nstuff \nuh you know you can't maximize all those \nthings but you know there's some \nsome trade-offs of course but uh yeah \nwe're trying to that's the the goals so \ncan you take me through kind of like the \nengineering architecture of combining \nthese different tools like combining \nuh like a causal inference part of it \nwith say the we v8 search would say the \nhugging face models and is that the kind \nof the architecture is it's like a \nrouting through the composition of \ndifferent uh like ai as an api kind of \nthings okay so the yeah so the \narchitecture for this in the the first \nimage here basically you can see that \nthere's a a consumer on the left and \nthen there's developer on the right \nand essentially you can think of \ndevelopers as \nputting all these apps into a sort of \nlike app store like thing uh i call app \nstore 2.0 for for similar reasons as \ncompany 2.0 \nand and basically the user is going to \nsee some unified interface \nwhere they're routed \nat any given time they're routed to the \nsort of ai decision app that is most \nrelevant for their given decision right \nso \nyou could start off with let's say i \ncared about um \ndeciding \num what restaurant to go to \nyou could have an app that \nfirst is just a general search app right \nso it's kind of horizontal so in the um \nin the \nsecond image here \nuh it's horizontal in the sense that it \nworks forever everything like google is \na general search app \nand then you could later on be routed to \na different app that's say focused on \non restaurant decisions \nafter you it's gotten the information \nfrom the search \nand yeah so so different apps here and \nthey can have different scopes so they \ncan be across everything like horizontal \nor they can be narrowly focused to just \none \none thing and um the reason that we \ndecided to do this so initially we were \nlooking at like \ninitially the plan was like hey ai is \ngetting way better and better \num you know gpd three's got this cool \nstuff \nand so we you know we tested it out and \nit's like okay it's cool \nbut it's it's kind of like a novelty \nthing where \npeople like it initially but then it \ndoesn't really solve their problems well \nenough to be a good product \nand and so then we started developing \nmore specific stuff you know that \ninvolves actually fine-tuning the models \nonce you fine-tune them you can get \npretty good stuff \nbut then that takes developer time \nso \nthe the kind of realization was like \nokay to get good enough quality for a \nlot of decision apps you have to have \nsome \nnon-zero developer time \nand so we um so that's where okay let's \ntry this app store model \nand um over time \nwe can automate like more and more of \nthat it can be so that it requires less \nand less developer time \nbut then like does that look attractive \nto developers you know if um they're \nthey're getting \nthey're they're spending less hours you \nknow they might be worried about \ncompensation \nso that's where it's like well you have \nto compensate them in equity um \nlike ownership of the company right so \nthen \nas ai gets better \nit helps oogway be better and helps \nincrease the value of oogway \nbut because the developers were at least \npartially compensated in equity \nthey're kind of hedged against the \nidea of like ai making it \ntake less and less time to develop these \nai apps \num \nand also you know it's like okay well \nthat you need a huge \nuh \ndeveloper supply to do all that stuff \nright to cover all decisions \nand so the insight there for like why \nthis is kind of good timing \nis \nis i think that \nthe ai developer supply \nis kind of expanding to the \nsoftware developer supply which is like \na larger supply right \nas we get tools like hugging face and \nand haystack that helps helps with \nsearch and you know open ai as we get \nmore in tools like that \num it just makes the barrier to entry \nfor ad development much easier and kind \nof can expand it to general software \ndevelopers which were which we're \nstarting to see a bit of oogway with \nlike people who are not ai experts \ndeveloping ai stuff too yeah i think \nthis is an extremely exciting idea so to \nfirst let's try to like just to kind of \nunpack each thing though \nthe first thing i want to talk \nabout is some so these big models like \ngpg3 and maybe we can use prompting to \ntry to get it to do more tasks or we can \nsay what they're really doing is the \nmixture of expert style of say like the \nlatest glam model with the trillion \nparameters from google it's looking what \nlike what they want to do instead is \nhave kind of sparse routing activations \ninstead of one massive dense \narchitecture and so something that i've \nbeen really curious about and it looks \nlike you're already set in motion on \ndoing this is applying that kind of \nmixture of experts kind of \nlayer on top of say the hugging face \nmodels api where uh i think they have \nlike 25 000 models that are probably \nmore \nactually i don't know i think probably \naround 25 000 but the idea of like \nof having a layer on top of that that \nlearns how to route classifications into \nthe hugging face model like the hosted \nmodels and then and then that's \nprobably maybe \nlike maybe is that more powerful than \ngpg3 or what's the comparison of that \nkind of idea compared to prompting in \ngbt3 yeah yeah that's really cool yeah \nwe call it the routing team at uh at ubi \nright so like \nwho's in charge of like routing stuff \nuh yeah i mean it certainly seems that \nright like take the \nmacaw from \nthe allen ai institute \nthey're supposed to be gpg3 at kind of \ngeneral purpose question answering so \ncertainly if you and like that's on \nhugging face right \num so \nyeah so that's just one example of where \nif you routed everything to gp3 but \nquestion answering stuff you write it to \nlike macaw say then uh \nthis is one example right there's \nprobably other ones then it should be \nbetter than gpd3 so so yeah so something \nthat i'm really excited about about uh \nbuilding out at wev8 is our uh vector \nsearch demo api so right now we have \nwikipedia wikidata and um and news \npublications and i'm working on adding \nuh the keras code examples and chaos api \nreference as search apis so similar to \nuh querying a model and just getting an \ninference on and and we have say the t5 \nthat unifies every task supervised \nlearning task into language modeling \nkind of so you can have this one \ninterface for querying the 25 000 i have \nno idea if that number is correct but \nthe x amount of models that are on \nhugging face similarly how does that \ngeneralize to say not just querying a \nmodel for uh for its inference but for \nquerying a search engine where each \nsearch api you can have the different \nretrievals so you can have tfidf bm25 uh \nexpert different ways of getting the \nrepresentation from sbirt you can have \nprompt burt so you can have like this \nstack of retrievers the stack of \nre-rankers and further processing and \nyou can have symbolic filters into the \nretrieval so how does the transition oh \nsorry this is like \ngoing off a little bit but the \ntransition from a mixture of experts \nover the abstraction layer on top of \nmodels to the abstraction layer on top \nof search apis okay so so it's you're \ntalking about um \nthe things that you're retrieving are \nmodels from hugging face right yeah i \nthink that's another way of looking at \nit is you could you could structure uh \nthis task as retrieved and read where \nyou're retrieving hugging face models as \nand then read and then re-ranking the \nmodels further like with that kind of \ncoarse-grained and then fine-grained \nstage one stage two processing pipelines \nand that's definitely another really \ninteresting idea i guess what i'm \ngetting into more is so like the idea of \nsay uh information augmented \nmodels that uh query like document \nindexes so like say the chord 19 data \nset from the allen institute where they \nhave 140 000 \npapers related to cova 19 supplementing \nit with that knowledge store so so the \nidea of the abstraction layer on top of \nwev8 vector search apis is you have the \nchord 19 corpus you've got say archive \npubmed \nwikipedia reddit conversations twitter \nand they're all in separate search apis \nand so you're \nyou're the orchestration layer is going \nhow do i want to route my queries to \nthese different information sources \ncompared to these the other idea which \nis these different uh like \nsay like compressed brains for the model \ninference so okay so you're talking \nabout um like you're doing \nyou know \nuh like a search engine right um where \nthere's various components right there's \nretrieval re-ranking and stuff \num but but the routing is happening to \nthe to the data sets right so uh rather \nthan \njust within one data set you're right \nyou're essentially finding the \nthe relevant \ndocuments \nuh there's a there's a layer before that \nright that's that's uh writing to the \ndata side okay so sorry i i think i i \nthink i understand that okay so as we \nthink about building these like meta \nabstraction layers that orchestrate a \nlike it's it's so it's sort of like \ninstead of trying to put an entire data \ndistribution \nin one \nmodel we simply we break up the \ninformation sources into different apis \nand then the oogway layer is \nyou know is the thing that routes \nthrough it and says here i've went and \nsearched the these specific knowledge \nsources \nand this is what i've produced kind of \nso there yeah so there's models but then \nthere's also information sources right \nand \nso i guess the way i so i haven't \nthought a ton about this right and it's \nlike not that i'm the main one who will \nbe uh implementing the search stuff but \nthe way i thought about this was that \nthis is like the search \num apps job right like that they're \ndoing \num \nthey're doing search right like like um \nyou know trying to do google like stuff \nand you know because google's trying to \ndo this stuff really well right um \nand you know and probably succeeding \nreasonably well like they're they uh \nit's probably non-trivial to improve on \ngoogle \nbut yeah so \nall this stuff about like routing to \ndifferent information sources in my head \ni think of it as like um one app a \nsearch like a search app but maybe it \ncould make sense to think about as \nsub apps maybe right like i'm not sure \num but but yeah that's how i think about \nuberway and it's like the search stuff \nis then just like one step in the \ndecision making pipeline like one \nflow of that you might do in decision \nmaking is i search for stuff i filter it \ndown \nand then i have some options and i \nevaluate the options right like that's \none example \num and and that in that example search \nis kind of like the first step \nso like a common thing with google is \npeople will go to google and then \nthey'll \nthey'll click into the first link \nthey'll skim through it click out \nclick into the next week skim through it \nclick out right and there's this like \nprocess of \ndownloading tons of information into \nyour head um \nthat you think probably you could \ndownload this information faster or you \ncould be targeted to this information \nfaster and that's all about improving uh \nsearch \nit's just getting that information \nbut then you have to like \ngrapple with that information so if \nyou're looking at products to buy you \nhave to think \ni need to remember oh what was that \nproduct i liked that i read in the first \nlink when you're reading the third link \nand you're trying to evaluate them but \nyou have to click back and forth between \nthe two that's because google is focused \non search so you could have a \nan interface that helps more with those \nother steps \nsorry that i kind of kind of \nyeah went on a tangent after answering \nthe initial thing \nso i guess the kind of the analog i'm \ntrying to make is say um we we went on \nthis transition where you compared gbt3 \nto say a mixture of experts over hosted \nmodels on the hugging face model hub and \nthis idea of a mixture of experts is so \nexciting because this attention \noperation it's differentiable it \nperforms this differentiable routing \nthat is causing this boom and mixture of \nexperts i'm trying to make the analog \nthat say from gpt 3 to the model hub the \nhugging face model hub is equivalent to \ngoogle to these we v8 demo or these \nsearch apis that we're trying to build \nwith wva where you have a collection of \ndifferent information sources and so \nyou're routing through how you want to \noccur these different information \nsources compared to the tasks similar to \ngpg3 of trying to compress the in all \nthe information into one api which \nwhich is maybe too grandiose and \nrequires this i mean i know i guess like \nthe point of google is doing this kind \nof orchestration layer but \ni think as \nmaybe as you kind of fine-tune it for \ndecision making and for personalization \nit has a different kind of flair to it \nbut so one other question i want to \ntouch upon and as i'm looking at this \narchitecture is this human in the loop \nhuman computer interaction and we've \nread there's a lot of really cool papers \nthat are coming out about how people are \nusing writing assistants chat bots to \nhelp them write what kind of specific \nthings they're using \nso what kind of like how does human \nfeedback kind of play into this loop for \nrouting between the different ai apps as \nwell yeah well so we think of oogway is \nit helps people make decisions it \ndoesn't make the decisions for them \nmaybe in the future it'll be a subset of \npeople who or for a subset of decisions \nthey wanted to be made for them \nbut that's not really something \nwe have in our sites right now uh \nor like maybe in the future you want \nsomething to like automatically schedule \nyour calendar for you or or something \nand you don't have to worry about it \nlike i think there's actually \nan app called motion i think that that's \nor a company called motion that they're \ntrying to do that \nbut yeah so it's just helping the person \nright so for example i'm trying to \nfigure out where to move to right now \nand i care a lot about uh climate stuff \nright so i look at maps of \nof um sun like sunlight hours uh so it's \nlike a us half an inch in it map and \nit's a heat map of the us for sunlight \nhours and then i do the same thing for \nlike \nuh snowfall like i you know i want some \nsnowfall \nand for the maximum temperature in the \nwinter in the summer \ni don't want it to be too hot \nso for user like me the idea is like it \ngives me that information \num and then maybe i could also tell it \nlike okay i've identified that i have \nthese three constraints that i would \nlike or these like 10 constraints \nand then you know like that i want this \nsnowfall above this amount i want \nsunlight hours above this amount i want \nmaximum summer temperature below this \namount \nand it could \nit could also take that and say okay \nhere's a place that satisfies those \nthis is like for me for choosing \nwhere to live but for other people it \nmight be different they might want \ndifferent \num \ninformation \nor and they might have different \ncriteria but the idea is that uh they \ncould they could give the criteria um to \noogway and then oogway helps them see \nhow the different options rank \naccording to that criteria so like a \ncommon thing if \nthat people might do is they make these \ntables where they have the options in \nthe rows \nand then their criteria in the columns \nor a transpose of that \num \nyeah and that's like a very simple thing \nthat you could think where it's like \nwe we could build those tables for for \nusers um \nif they want those tables right not \neveryone wants those tables so it might \nlook different for them \nsorry i think it's going to hit them \nso i'm thinking about this this kind of \nidea of this application of trying to \nfind the perfect place in let's say uh \nlike the united states that you want to \nlive based on the climate \nso i'm thinking about this routing \nbetween these different apis and so with \nthe we va search engine what you could \ndo is you could say one of these apis is \num like all of reddit data and you can \ngive it the symbolic filters the \nsymbolic text filters uh that discuss \nclimate and that are discussed in the \nunited states but maybe you want to \nmatch those regular expressions for the \nsymbolic filtering for the retrieval and \nthen you could \nprepend like a chat bot that takes that \nkind of information \nand is maybe personalized to this user \nis that kind of the thinking of just \nlike so you take the the we v8 reddit \napi to retrieve information about this \nparticular kind of idea of um \nyou know i want to have a some sunlight \nsome snowfall and then you have some \nkind of maybe like \na reasoning model from the hugging face \nmodel hub that maybe has been \nfine-tuned on some task of in-domain \ndata where about weather conversations i \ndon't i don't know if such a data set \nexists but is that kind of the thinking \nof routing between these different kind \nof like \nlike open source ai's api kind of tools \nyeah um yeah so i think that sounds \nright like the um so the user might be \ntaken to like a reddit conversation \nthat's relevant for them is that the \nkind of thing you're thinking of \nwell i guess so i guess what i'm \nthinking is we're decomposing this task \ninto two parts where we use the we va \nreddit retrieval to get like 50 000 of \nthese conversations and then and then we \nfurther pass them into a re-ranker that \nyou know compresses it down into the \nsalient points like maybe like an \nabstracted summarization model from this \nmassive context or something and then \nmaybe some other kind of chat bot layer \nthat you're and you're just kind of \nplugging in you're just like api \nrequests from \nyeah yeah absolutely right so \num \n[Music] \nso my uh co-founder federico he built a \num a thing that goes through several of \nthose steps \num where he's like doing search \nand then he's extracting things and then \neventually trying to summarize them \num \nand \nand yeah so the idea is that \nlike \na a person a developer could go and \ndevelop whatever they they want \npotentially with help from this sort of \nlike core tooling right so \nthere's all this nice core tooling right \nlike so there's there's hugging face \nthere's webv8 haystack \num so we wanna like use all those you \nknow we don't wanna build uh our own \nversions of those i think \nbut then there's places where so we were \nusing haystack right and we were having \nlike it's just not as easy to use as \nhugging face you have to handle hosting \nand stuff and \nso we were building our own like hosting \nstuff like well let's just make this an \napi call um so that using haystack feels \nlike using hugging face for our for any \ndevelopers that decide they need search \nstuff \num \nbut yeah so people could string together \nwhatever they they want um and then \nbasically they can developers can get \ndirection from from users um \nand so like you don't you don't take \nsolutions from users right you take \nproblems from from users and then you \nyou try to figure out a \nsolution and then we have some like \nproduct people who like interface like \noh here's what the users seem to are \nhaving problems with how do we solve \nthis problem and like ai people are like \nah there you go and it's uh yeah and but \nso so search wise right now we don't \nhave anyone so we're pretty young right \noogway launched its discord \nmaybe like two weeks ago it's just kind \nof this decentralized uh \ncommunity building this stuff together \nand um \nand yeah so it's basically open where \nanyone can see like what's going on and \nstuff i even thought about putting a \nsearch on top of discord to better help \npeople understand like uh \nwhat \nyou know so they come in they're like \nwhat what's going on here \nwho who uh who do i need to talk to \nabout x and then that's where like \nsearch is is relevant for putting that \nkind of stuff on top of discord but \nwe're young we haven't built that stuff \nyet \num but yeah everything's like open \nsource it's supposed to be people can \num \nhelp \nthey can use tools from open source and \nthen they can also push back out the \nother way where like we have a \nuh say we have a thing that makes \nhugging fake or uh haystack easier to \nuse then we would have that \nopen source for anyone to use yeah so \nlet me quickly uh point on two things \nand then i want to get into the um this \ndecentralized startup idea so the first \nof which is um so we we interviewed um \nuh malte peach from \nuh haystack on the fourth we've a \npodcast i remember what number it was \nbut um so they have the deep set cloud \ngui did you check out that with respect \nto setting up the apis with haystack \nyeah so \ni think they were in like beta and i \nlooked at their beta and it was like it \ndidn't \nlike i wanted to not just do \nuh i think they were doing like search \nplus question and answering and i wanted \nto just do search or something it's \nbasically something i could do with \ntheir python library i couldn't do in \ntheir \num thing at the time \nand then when we asked them about scale \nlike how many documents they could \nhandle \nit was basically like they they weren't \nplanning to handle a large amount of \nlike over 10 million documents \nanytime super soon \nso we had to host it ourselves and stuff \nto handle like more documents and \nand uh yeah but but you know maybe in a \nyear then they'll they'll have solved \nthese issues right it's just kind of \nlike a timing thing that they might be \ntoo young \nyeah and i think um trying to help \npeople understand the combination \nbetween we've eat and haystack and gina \nai and how these different things plug \nin together i think that's one of the \ncore goals of this podcast and this \ncontent is to try to figure out how \nthese things fit together and so i yes i \nthink if you just want to use search and \nthen you want to do further python \nprocessing i think we v8 alone might be \nwhat you need because it has that kind \nof \npython client where you can still just \ndo the get the near the nearest neighbor \nkind of filter and then further process \nit with that so the second thing before \ngoing to uh decentralized startups is um \nso we've partnered with um katie they've \nrecently uh integrated a question \nanswering system into our slack so \nsimilar to what you're describing with \ndiscord where you have a \nquestion answering in slack and yeah \nthis idea to me is so exciting uh like \nduplicate question detection i know in \nour weevie it's like i'm probably asking \nquestions that just make me look like a \nrookie because i don't you know i i i \ncan't find the exact question when i do \nlike the current slack search and so \nthis idea of trying to get rid of asking \nduplicate questions alone i i think like \njust the burden on open source software \ndevelopment and getting new people i \nthink solving that alone is huge but i \nlove that idea of adding question \nanswering to uh you know discord slack \ncommunity group chat so so now let's \nlet's talk a little more about \ndecentralized startups because i'm \nreally curious about your um \nthinking around this and like um \nyou know like this tokens and what's \ndaos i don't understand any of this i'm \njust kind of curious about how you're \nthinking about this kind of idea \nyeah well okay so on the whole like \ncrypto stuff and dao stuff uh i know a \nlot of people will be like \nuh groves um \nso i'm i'm not like dogmatic religio \nlike religious about that stuff it's \njust that we had a problem \nthat we were running into \nuh namely that \nuh the non-zero developer time problem \nper decision \nwhere the solution was um some crypto \nstuff right where we can essentially \nput in a program \ncomp like equity compensation \nand \nand you can make it so that that program \nis not gonna \nyou can trust that it's not gonna change \na bunch in the future like it's a common \npattern with \nuh some some past startups some tech \ntech companies where in the beginning \nit's like hey everything's free \neverything's great and then later on \nthey're like well hold on we have all \nthese shareholders that we need to \nmaximize profits to \nthe shareholders are not necessarily the \nusers \num we need to extract as much value \num out of \nyou know for like companies where the \nbusiness models are ads \nthe the the users are the ones um like \ntheir attention they're essentially \nselling their their attention right to \nthe advertising uh the ad company the \nones that are running ads \num \nand so you know they're trying to \nextract that value \nand and so when you \nyou can make it so that um you don't \nhave to worry about the organization \nlike changing like that in the future \nwhere um \nwhere it goes against like users say \none by you can you can make these things \nhard to change right so like when you \nthink about setting up governments like \nthe united states for example \nthey tried to \nmake it so that it's hard to change \nright like the president \num especially at the beginning was not \nsupposed to uh have too much power \nnowadays people might think they have \nmore more power but they still don't \nit's not like they're a dictator in \nterms of the amount of power they they \nhave right like the in the beginning the \nu.s i think there's some story about \nwhere um i think george washington would \nanswer the door to the white house \nhimself \nand there wasn't like someone else to \nanswer it was just him \njust to give an idea for that stuff \nbut uh let's see you can put checks and \nbalances in companies as well or or \nfuture organizations and \nthen \nyou you can set up incentives such as \nlike who are the people who are making \nuh decisions who are the like the \nshareholders in modern companies \nit's like well that's just whoever like \nhas um \nuh decision making rights right so like \nuh equity plus \nthis like governance stuff is i think \nhow you commonly see it allocated in \nmodern companies \nbut you you can get those governance uh \nrights \nso just for making decisions \norganization \nand just give them to whoever right so \nif you want it to be that one-third \none-third of it's allocated to users \nthen there you go and then that's very \ndifferent incentives \nfrom companies where their users \nare only like 0.1 \nof the shareholders or whatever right \nespecially because the users are \nprobably not \ndon't have very much money so so they uh \nit's usually people who have more money \nare able to \ncontrol more of in the shareholding \nvotes right \nbut um yeah so in short \num \nwe can make it hard to change \nuh like you can put out a smart contract \nright that encodes the equity \ncompensation \nand then you can make it so that when \nthere are changes \num \nit's it's the \nthe incentives are aligned it's not just \num people who want to maximize profits \nbut it's also people who are actually \nusing the product so if the people using \nthe product don't wanna they're not in \nfavor of the super big like extracting \ntons of value out of or \nout of them then then that can you can \nset up incentives that way \nyeah i can definitely understand that \nthe idea of the users adding value to \nthe to the product or even like even \naside from ai just like network effects \nfrom things like you know twitter \nlinkedin facebook youtube like just the \ngeneral idea that you create the content \nyou're what's making the platform \nvaluable and that idea shared ownership \nand i think with ai systems it's going \nto be even more \nlike even more on the nose about that \nwhere you're creating the data that used \nto train the model to replace you almost \nin in your role of the network but like \nso just kind of \nthis idea of organizing companies this \nway but when you have like a decision \nlike a vote is to be made like who poses \na decision worth voting on is it like a \nreddit forum where you say like i \npropose this the acquisition of this \ncompany and then \nit's upvoted to the top so now we're \ngonna like \nvote on this acquisition deal \nyeah well so i think \nso \npeople have heard of dows a little bit \num \nthe essential it's supposed to stand for \ndecentralized autonomous organization \nit's that's it's not a very accurate \nname right for a lot of um a lot of them \nbut um a lot of the ways they have been \ndeciding this stuff is they have uh \nit's it looks just like regular public \ncompanies to me like where it's the \namount of shares you have that you that \nyou bought right so it's proportional to \nyour the amount of money you have \nis how much voting power you have \num \nyeah i mean i \nthis or or then the other one is one \nperson one vote which looks like a \ndirect democracy so one is like uh \ni figure what the word is where it's \nlike wealth um \nlike a plutocracy maybe where it's like \nyour your voting power is weighted by \nyour wealth \nversus direct democracy or both the \nmodels that people are using i mean um \nthis might sound bad to some people but \ni think both of those are are \nclearly uh wrong \nlike especially like direct democracy i \ni know is like a popular thing but it's \num that's a good way to get mediocre \ndecisions i would say so \nso \nyou know there are pareto distributions \nand people's competences \nand um \ncompetition is a different thing so \nfor a given decision there might be like \none or two or three you know some small \nnumber of people who are like way \nthey're gonna make a way better decision \nthan anyone else \nand and so \nthis is part of the company 2.0 stuff is \nuh \nwe're \nwe're not we haven't done this we \nhaven't succeeded at this yet but we're \ntrying to set up a system where \nyou're able to select out the most \ncompetent people for a given decision \nand you know it's probably not going to \nbe the founders for all the decisions \num \nand and then you can let them make that \nthat decision like potentially in a \nsmall group and uh the pareto \ndistribution premise is kind of like a \nbig \nbig thing there \nand why do you want that it's like well \nif everyone \num has some equity in oogway \nthe the better decisions uboys makes the \nthe more value way will create and the \nmore valuable you'll be so it actually \nhelps everyone \nfor um \nall like people as part of oogway \nfor the the best people for a given \ndecision to make that that decision \nand uh \nyeah so this is a this is a thing that \nwe're working on now it's it's very hard \nproblem but but uh i think there's new \ntools coming out that make it easier \nthan it was in the past like modern \ncompanies look much more like \nautocracies i guess \nwhere or \nlike the ceo but then i guess there's a \nboard right who can who who uh controls \nstuff so that's more like allegory \noligarchy like \nyeah i'm really excited about like um \nalso just like ai education tools and \neven even it doesn't have to be like \nsuper ai even just like youtube videos \nthat are distributing more information \nto kind of \nsupplement the democracy one person one \nvote rather than the concentration \naround the experts who make all the \ndecisions i think having just better \neducation tools whether it's \nlike \nan interactive kind of quizlet style \nthing where you ask them questions and \nthey you know this kind of whole system \nand then yeah like you earn tokens to \nkind of weight your vote further by \ndoing the education i think could be an \ninteresting idea and that kind of thing \ni'm just like i've never thought about \nthis before but i'm thinking but so one \nother thing with this that i want to \ntalk about is like what about like the \nlaws around accredited investors do you \nthink that's just like \nis that a law that's trying to protect \npeople from you know \nforegoing their salary and then taking \nthese tokens that might not be worth \nanything or is it something that you \nthink is maybe \npreventing people from participating in \nstartups say \nyeah well so \nuh a credit just for people who don't \nknow a credit investor you know \nbasically means you have one million \ndollars in in a net worth not including \nyour home or \nyeah or it's something like you make \nyou've made two hundred thousand dollars \nuh in salary for the past like three \nyears or something like that right \nit's all about um \nhow much money you have or or make \nthey're they're adding some stuff about \nlike \nweird tests you can take \num that look like \nlike certifications that traders get and \nstuff to become accredited but that's \nreally not how most people are going to \nbe \nlike most normal people are going to \nbecome accredited so it's really about \nwealth \nand \nthe idea from the sec so that they're \nthe ones who regulate whether you can \nbuy \nownership in a company um \nbefore it's on the \npublic market so when it's private so \nthey they say it's about investor \nprotection they're protecting people \nfrom \nmaking bad investments \num \nit's a little bit weird that \nyou can't become accredited from some \nmore like knowledge based thing then if \nthat's the case \nbut so that's it and and there's yeah \nbut if you want to be compliant with the \nsec nowadays \nthere are \nexemptions that you can use so \nif you like when people when companies \nraise venture capital they're often \nusing the regulation d 506 \nc or b exemption \nand um \nthat allows you to raise money from from \na venture capitalist basically and the \nangel investors and stuff who are \naccredited investors but if you want to \nraise money from non-accredited \ninvestors like just regular people \nyou can do that under regulation \ncf for crowdfunding is what it's called \nyou can raise up to like five million \ndollars and stuff but there's there's \nother rules \nthat make things \nlike rules around advertising not being \nable to publicly advertise stuff \nthat make things difficult so that's why \na lot of crypto people end up just \nignoring all of the rules \nand uh \njust doing their own thing and they'll \nbecome like anonymous so that their the \ngovernment won't \nknow who they are i guess i \ni don't think it's that hard to deal \nanonymize people but uh that but they \nthink they're anonymous at least \nyeah i'm obviously not anonymous so \nwe've talked about a lot of topics from \ncausal inference and deep learning to \noogway ai the decision making layer \norchestrating all these different ai as \na service apis and talking about \ndecentralized startups and thinking \nabout how we're going to how the future \nof company 2.0 and organizing companies \nis going to be with the advancement of \nthese ai tools and i think of ai tools \nparticularly i think nlp tools are going \nto have \na massive impact on the way that we \norganize these companies things like \nyou know question answering systems in \nour slack chats and \njust the way that we can trade \ninformation with each other is also \ninteresting so just kind of one last \nquestion i'm curious about like um your \ninformation diet and kind of how you're \norganizing your time between \nare you you know like running a startup \nare you mostly putting out fires and \nbuilding new stuff or like how do you \nwait doing that and then say like \nknowledge discovery reading papers and \ndoing the kind of \nscientific experiments what's kind of \nlike \nyour strategy for \nkind of continuing to develop your \nknowledge and build this tool \num yeah so i guess it's i try to figure \nout what are the most important things \nfor me to spend time on i make sure to \nspend time on those things like recently \ni had to learn a lot about legal stuff \num \nbut also \njust my personality i'm uh \ni need to be learning about just like \nrandom stuff so uh \ni'll often just be learning about \nrandom stuff that it's like not obvious \nthat i should be spending time learning \nabout that at that time \num \nyeah so i think that's \nthat's it i do you know i ai stuff it's \nlike i read it if i need to be reading \nit \nor um \nor if it just like has randomly caught \nmy attention i guess is what i'm looking \nat ai stuff \nso how often do um like when say the new \npaper tweets that are coming out so \nfrequently how how does that kind of \nlike and i have that same kind of \ntendency of just like being curiosity \ndriven and you feel like you need to \nread it just because it's gotten your \nattention how do you kind of like put \nthe blinders on that kind of stuff and \nstay focused about getting too caught up \nin all the latest headlines that come \nout seemingly every day yeah well okay \nso when \ni guess when you said the phrase putting \non fires when there's fires it's not so \nhard to have blinders on i think \num \nyeah some chemical thing in your brain \nmakes makes it that way \nand then when there's non-fires \ni don't know i'm i'm um \nlike i am a \ni'm a fan of kind of like maximizing \nmotivation and uh \nit's a little bit radical but like like \ni think that discipline is maybe a bit \noverrated and that motive motivations \nunder natural curiosity is underrated so \ni just kind of \ni'm more just go with the flow when uh \nwhen's when i want to be looking at \nstuff \nbut uh but yeah i mean you you need i \nthink different like a diversity of \npeople on that right you i think you \nneed people who are more like \nthey're really good at focusing and it's \nhard to distract like you can't distract \nthem and then people who are more um \nall over the place i i think that you \nneed a a \nuh diversity in in organization of those \nkinds of people awesome yeah so thank \nyou so much brady for coming on the wvva \npodcast loved hearing about oogway ai it \nsounds like such an exciting project and \nhopefully you'll come back on the \npodcast to discuss the update of it in a \nfew months so thanks again for coming on \nthe podcast \nnice connor thanks for uh thanks for \ntaking the
