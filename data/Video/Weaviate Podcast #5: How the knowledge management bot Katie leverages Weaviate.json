{"text": "Katie is a knowledge management bot, continuously improving, self-learning, and trained by humans. Under the hood, Katie is ... \nthanks for checking out the fifthepisode of the we vva podcast today i'mjoined with michael weichner who'sbuilding a really interesting systemcalled katy which is a really excitinguse of these natural language processingvector search systems to answerquestions about uh business data and soin this podcast it's going to be alittle different when we really diveinto a specific applicationand put together all the pieces of thevector search engine solution and the wevva database and understanding how tobuild these kind of systems end to endso michael thank you so much for comingon the podcast and could you explain tous what the kd system is and what thegoals of it are oh yeah sure well thankyou very much for the invitation umyeah well maybe just to give you alittle background how i got to katieactually i'm uh i'm participating inopen source for quite a long time ibecame apache software foundation member2004whereas at this time we did a contentmanagement solutionso i'm really part of various opensourcecommunities for for many many years andone of the big problems i think onmailing list is you know thatmany people uh ask the same questionsand i think it's it's good that they askthese questions but then you know ofcourse there are some people which gettired of these and then the answer is uhread the manualandi understand this but at the same timeit's not so nice that people do this youknow andand so i often thought you know how canyou solve this problem that you knowthat uhand you know a machinea machine is much more patient thanhumans you know so i i always thought ifa machine could be doing this this wouldbe great actually detecting you knowduplicated questions and then answeringthese also on mailing list oryou know chat channels like slack orwhatever i mean at these times likedidn't exist you had irc anduh similar things that's one that's onereason and then the other thing was likeifor most of the time i worked withwithin my own companyand which which never you know like wasnot like a huge companyand then there was a time when i workedfor a bigger company which had like 600employeesand there the first time i realized youknow if you are in a bigger companyyou of course you know the peopleworking next to you are working in theteam but you don't know everyone at thiscompanyand then it's a similar problem you knowyou had a questionbut you don't know how to ask thisbecause uh you know a slack channel with600 employees just doesn't scale itdoesn't work because you know ifeveryone would postyou couldn't and you know people wouldjust get crazy and get out of thechannel and also these mailing listsit's similar and then so what'shappening you normally you you ask thepeople around you you know like youcould be the person sitting next to youor people from your team and then yousay well how does this work and thenthey say oh i don't know but ask thisperson and then you know you youcontinue like thisso again you know i was thinking howcould you solve this andthat so that's the other thing iobserved and then the other thing was atthis time at this company i worked on uhbasically i worked you know i did kindof research on conversational interfacesyou know like similar to siri and alexand these kind of thingsand uh we were doing prototypes andyou knowvery simple things like for example thenyou you know here in europe you have alot of public transportation so you cansay you know hey siri tell me what isthe the next train going to decent thiscity you know or how much does this costandand these cases they worked quite wellbut you know as soon as it's gettingmore complicated you know for example ifyou have to say something like you knowi should be there at this point and youknow maybe i i don't know you havedifferent conditionsuh you know that the things the chatbotsdon't work so well anymore whereashumans you know they really are able todeal with the situation because they sayuh okay maybe you mean these or whatwhat exactly do you want and then byasking you a couple of questions andalso understanding the context you knowhumans are able to deal with this kindof uhnot so clear conversation and andfuzziness so so i was thinking oh maybemaybe it's just uh maybe we tried tosolve something which we are not quitethere yet even humans are able to arecapable of doing this so i thought ohyou know maybe we just concentrate ondetecting duplicated question if you'reable to solve this problemyou know then we can make the next stepand go beyond this so this is actuallyhow i started katie it's really i myfocus was just onyou know detecting duplicated questionsyou know and trying to answer them asgood as possible which the idea is soyou know so you ask me a question forexample you know i i love mountainbiking like riding my mountain bike anddoing cross-country races so one one onequestion is there you know what are thebest tires you know to do country crosscountry race because uh you know youwant to be as fast as possible so andmany people ask this question and ofcourse the answer is changing you knowbecause there are new tires every yearyou know that there are some they haveall these littleuh but still the question is the same soif if somebody's answering this questionand you know somebody's asking thequestion again two days later you know ican just pull it up so so that's that'sthe the main focus of haiti andand then of course once you start doingthis you you very naturally you get intothis vector search area you know becauseuhyeah it's as i said you know the thetypical example would be you know wheni'm asking you how old are you connoryou knowit's and i'm asking two days later whatis what is the age of conor you knowthey are for us humans it's compleit's it's clear it's the same questionyou know it's about your age but for thecomputer it's not so clear you know soand uh so this is i think where thesimilarity search comes in then you knowit's um yeah that's that's itso on the first thing you said i itreminded me of this book a lot uhworking in public the making andmaintenance of open source software ireally recommend this to readers and umyeah it really describes that problemthat you're describing the first thingyou said about open source softwarepeople asking the same questions and andthe kind of the strain on the developerstime of answering the same question overand over again i love hearing that storythis this idea of detecting duplicatequestions and that kind of motivatinguse case i wanted to ask you if you sawthe the core question pairs data set andhow much that kind of academic data setguides your real world projects no i isaw that i i to be honest i'm not uh ii'm subscribed to quora and i receiveyou know quora keeps sending menotifications about because i you know ii started physics many years ago likei'm actually a physicist i i didn'tstudy computer scienceuh but maybe and i got very naturally iactually when i started physics i didn'tlike programming so muchi i was more like the you know pen andpaper personbut then when i did basic research i didcomputer simulation so i had to get intoprogramming and this was like yeah likelike 25 years agoand and i really loved it because ithink it's like building lego you knowit's building things with lego you canbuild whatever you want withoutmuch money you know you don't need muchyou just need a computer and that's itbasicallyand uhbut coming back to court and you know soan encore i receive a lot of uhquestions and answers regarding physicsyou know people always ask things likeyou know who's thebest physicist you know and how aboutthese theory and these kind of things soso these are actually but otherwise ididn't use quora much but then i sawthat quora i think published this dataset of i think 400 000 questions andanswers of course which is really greatand uh at the same time very similarstack overflow where people ask you knowquestions and answersand but there again you know what i sawis what i have observed the problem isyou know for example with stack overfloweven if there are a lot of questions andanswersyou know you still for the same questionyou get a lot of answers you knowand and you not just and also againquestions are formulated differently youyou and in the end a human actuallywould be able to consolidate these youknow if a human would really spend timeon this they would say okay here arefive questions they are actually thesame question you know but they're justformulated differently at the same timethere are20 answersand some of them are right some of themare not really right you knowand again you know i i think this is noi mean i think it's great for and stackoverflow they provide great amount ofcontentto you know for us as a training and uhtraining set basicallyand also at the same time think abouthow can we improve this because stillwith stack overflow and quora i still asa humani don't get aperfect answer you know like it's notlike and of course maybe sometimes thereisn't a perfect answer because there areif you know it's like this again withthe mountain bike example you knowdepending if i'm just asking what is thebest tire for cross-country race youknow there will not be one silver bullettire you know that depending on the raceconditions there can be different tyresso it's not a perfect but still a humanwould tell you okay depending on thiscondition this tire is really great orthis tire is really great and i thinkthe same is true with stack overflowsometimes and quaraand for us this is really a great greatdata you know which we can make use ofandandbut our goal and maybe our promise isthat with katie we really are able to dothis better you know better than what weare able to do and i'm very confidentthat wewe can do better we can even do betterthan humans you know becauseuh these these computers uh we have thepossibility that we really are able toprocess much more data than a human isable to process basically sowhich i think is really great actuallyyeah and it sounds interesting like umyou could get you could have like acertainty threshold on the duplicate andif it's sayuh like in between 70 to 80 then youwould ask for more context from the userand get even more kind of feedback inthat system but so the question that wetalk about on all every we vva podcastthat i'm curious about is so with a dataset like cora question pairs 400 000annotated examples of similar questionsa massive annotation scale you'd imaginebootstrapping something like that foryourself would beexpensive and difficult andso the question is does is that all doesthat generalize a model that's trainedonaligning the similarity between the corequestion pairs data set do you feel likeyou need to fine-tune that for your usecase or do you feel like thatoff-the-shelf model just works rightaway i know we actually we have to findunit because just to give you an exampleone of our customers is an insurancecompany you know for legal uh insuranceyou know like let's say for example yourneighbori don't know for some reason made uhyou know the children of your neighborhit your door and now the door is kindof damaged you know so then you callyour insurance company and say hey bythe way my neighbor did this and youknow what about you know and then youask these questionsand so in the insurance company spacethey have a lot of you know veryspecialized termsyou know and very specialized situationswhich you will not find on quora youknow or we which will not find on stackoverflow or whateverso and this data this is not availablepublicly you know i mean some of it isyou know some you know some regularcasesor some more obvious cases they might bepublic you mean usas far as i know for example googleand tencent you know they try to get uhthey really tried to get into thisinsurance space and also make it morepublic but still there's a lot ofspecial terms andspecial situations which are not publicand you will not getthis data for free you really have towork with these companies and even thenthey are very hesitant to give this dataout but of course if they want somethinglike katieto get good results they have to give usthe data otherwise we can i mean againbut to think about it yourself you knowif you never worked in the insurancespace you will not knowthe terms and the the situations whichare happening there you know and so youare not able toyou even if you have like kind of atransfer learning but you will not ableto answer the things the questions soyou really have to get familiar withthese special situations and and youhave to fine-tune your models based onthese basically but but otherwise ofcourse yeah that the learning itself isthe same you know whether it be theinsurance or whether it be uhyou know a medicine or whether it bephysics or whether it be just thegeneral public domain knowledgebasically so yeah it sounds like theproblem is the out of distribution ofthe new words and uh even something likea sub word or a byte pair encodertokenizer still has to generalize tothese out of distribution tokens whenyou go from say yeah core question pairsto legal documents or even stackoverflow whereyou might ask a question about aspecific python library that obviouslyis not in the core data set so it has totry to generalize to some new tokens andobviously it has no basis to do that somaybe like advances in tokenizers wouldhelp that but i i agree that it doesseem like and there's a paper calleddon't stop pre-training that i reallylike that that talks about this furtherfine-tuning and so yeah i think i agreethat it seems like in most cases thefurther fine-tuning will be important soas you've been fine-tuning these modelswhat have been some of the lessonsyou've learned in training uh saysiamese bird style encoders are you afan of using data augmentation or whatkinds of things go into that fine-tuningoh to be honest i i don't know i i'm notfamiliar enough to be honest with thesedetails this is actually one reason weuse v8 you knowbecausei really yeah i have to be honest i'mnot i i couldn't tell you this issomething i well me personally i stillhave to learnand at the same time we really try toyou know really learn from uh productsor companies like bv8 you know to dothis soyeah i i really couldn't tell you i ijust know iwhat i know although what i've learnedis in this sense it's reallyyeah you do have to the context is veryimportant you know it's like just yousaid python for example you know inprogramming python is a language but ifyou go toyou know if you don't if you don't talkabout like let's say you are inagriculture you know pythonpeople will not consider python in alanguage they consider it an animalbasically you know sosouhi think in this sense the contextunderstanding the context is very veryimportant this is something i've learnedandand also uhandandi think let's let's say this way youknow i think by understanding thecontext and uhyeah you can do much better answersbasically and you you have to somehowuse this alsouhi try to let me try to think about youknow it's like mymy wife or my children are asking me aquestions question you know and if theyjust shout it across the room you knowand i don't know the context it's veryhard to answer these questions so i haveto ask well what do you mean exactlyare you asking because of this or askingbecause of this so also humans you knowif you don't have the context you can'treally answer you can just make a guessstatistically of courseyou know if they ask me all the time thesame thing or i already anticipate thecontext i can answer it but if it'scompletely out of con i'm not aware ofthe context i can't really give you agood answer except that i say okay within 90 of the cases uh if somebody asksthis question this will be the answerbut it might be completely wrong becausei don't know the contextwell i think you've touched on anotherkind of part of this that is that issuch an exciting part of these retrieveand read pipelines is how you cantake the query you can maybe use thesame kind of encoder for the query asyour document index and then return moredocuments you could have a userembedding you could maybe have a historyof queries from the user and then youhave these pipelines where you mightwant to further annotate the querywhether it's just with uh like latefusion with theyou know the latent spaces theembeddings that goes back into theretrieval component and you can puttogether these pipelines of having yourdatabase having different retrieverswhether those different retrievers are asymbolic sparse retriever tfidfvm25 or adense dpr esbert or some kind ofneurosymbolic search which is what we'veeat offers is by doing a you know esperlook up but also with symbolic filteringthese different kinds of retrievers youhave different ways of processing thequery itself and then different ways ofthen reading from what's turned so asyou develop these pipelines for flowingthe data through to the end use case howhas that been in plugging thesedifferent components together and howhas how much oflike what wev8 offers has kind ofbootstrap this kind of end-to-endpipeline well uh yeah maybe i can tellyou a little bit about the architectureabout katie you know how it works nowand how we make use of vv8 and where wereally see the advantage of thissowhat my understanding right now is youknow i don't think at the moment andmaybedon't get me wrong aboutit's really just mymy state of the art at the moment itseems to me there is no silver bulletyou know it's there's no one solutionwhichgives you the perfect uhsolution basicallyand so what we did is the the way how webuilt it uh the architecture is reallythat we can plug in different algorithmsvery easilyeven peryou know pair knowledge base you knowlike for example in the insurance spacewe can use a completely differentalgorithm for the knowledge base of theinsurance or you know forfor frequently asked questions of apachelucene we can useapache lucien by itself so so werealized oh that's at least our opinioni think it's very important that we canvery easily change this exchange thisyou know and even everyone can use theirown version so vva for the vvafrequently asked questions we can use v8you know and see how far we getat the same time we can use differentalgorithms at the same time you know andhaving different result sets and thenyou know combining them somehow so thisis one thingi think which is very important and ithink the other thing i think which isvery important and this is justobserving myself you know observinghumans you know how you processquestions and answersi think the magic isthe magic is really in understanding thequestion you know how we because onceyou understand the question and this issomething maybe we can talk about alittle more in detail you know what doesit actually mean understanding thequestionbut i think by understanding thequestion you can give a good answerand i think a very simple case is likeyou know if you if if uh if you ifsomebody would ask me how old is connoryou knowi understand it's about the age of conorbut the point now is i knowi don't have this information in myknowledge base you know in my knowledgegraph in my brain i know you you know iknow conor i know there is a corner andi knowyou are the only corner i know but iknow i don't have this information in myknowledge base soonce i understand the question i cantell you oh sorry i don't know theanswer you know and this is for examplesomething which search engines don't dotoday you know they always give you ananswer you knowthey they never tell you oh sorry idon't know i understand your questionbut i don't know the answerand i think this is something which youcan see and i think it shows that humansdo this not just based onyou know uh uh uh uhprobabilities but they really byunderstanding you know of course theycan say okay maybe the answer is likethis and this but they still tell youactually i don't knowand and i think this is also veryimportant to understand so our goal atthe moment is really to to developsomethinglike a at the concept of understanding aquestion and i think therei think one of course one thing isreally named entity recognition you knowagain if you if you take the example ofyou know how old is corner you a simplenamed entity recognition isunderstanding corner is a human it's aperson you know and uh how old is itmeans it's about the age so once youhave these two concepts a person namedconnor and the h you know then you cando a normal querythere's no moreyou know similarity search or whateveryou can go into a regular rationaldatabase and just do a query and and ifyou see there is no corner you know youcan say okay sorry i don't have ananswer you know even if i understandyour questionsouhbut then of course uh you know whenso if you use just similarity search ina brute force version you know then thenthe similarity search probably willreturn yeah there is something you knowuhyeah this question how old is conor it'svery it's similar similar to thequestion how old is uhi don't know uhyou know uh cornelia i connelly is likeafemale name i don't know i i don't don'tget me uhuh maybe a better example is you know inin in in inenglish uh in german italia italianspace you have the name andrea andandreas you know or andrea for exampleandrea can be a female name or it can bea male nameso if you ask how old is andrea you knowand if you have this answeruhin the database somehow you knowand but somebody's asking how old isandreasprobably from the sentence embedding itit's very similar you know it's veryclose to each other but actuallyit's very different because me as ahuman i understand andreas is acompletely different person than andreayou know because one is it could be maleor female or the other is very sure it'sa male version you know soand i think this is something we reallyhave to be careful with and uhand i think this is somethingto be honest i don't know either yet howto do this best but uh but i think thisis why i like vv8 very much because ithink what i think really is great aboutvva that v8 is really focusing very hardon these you know and they're reallyvery dedicated on these and i think it'sreally great to have this and that vv8is doing this so yeah if i could pitchyou on maybe an idea to uman idea around this idea of saydisambiguation and named entityrecognition and then trying tounderstand how well your system isunderstanding your query i was thinkingmaybe it could be interesting to have avisualization of the graph structure ofthe nearest neighbors to your query souh when you do a query and you get ananswer that you know you like what'sgoing on at this answer you could youcould look into the graph and you couldsee the what h sw has returned and youcan see kind of the linking between thedistances between maybe it's your queryand in the nearest saysentence or paragraph in the documentindex or maybe it could even be and thencoming back to this idea of named entityrecognition disambiguation maybe itcould link to a word embedding as welland i don't think we've explored toomuch of doing the distances betweenentire contextual representations ofentire sequences compared to theindividual word embeddings but i canimagine for this kind of thing where youhave a query like ummaybe it's like some kind of questionabout some specific breed of tigerand that's and tiger is one of your wordembeddings maybe you'd want to see thatkind of thing on the graph to be likeokay well it at least sees that i'mtrying to ask about a tiger and thenmaybe you'd also want to plug it into agenerative modellike a gbt that can generate a longsequence of text to to generatesomething that would have a highsemantic similarity according to youruhyour you know that latent embeddingspace but then still have that be on thenatural language manifold and not justbe like adversarial noise to optimizethe similarity but some kind of likegraph visualization like that to giveyou more understanding ofhow your system has interpreted thequery well i i could imagine uh thatthis could really happen i thinklet's say this way i think there's stilla lot ofroom space for improvementand just to give you an example uh maybeit's a little bit off topic but i thinkit's very similar you know about justunderstanding i think why humans areconsidered to be quite intelligent youknow not just humansand i think this you can see you know uhwhen you when you think about i mean idon't know whether you know this book byuh conor man i think the slow and fastthinkingandi think it's really a great book andbecause and i think it's also thequestion about consciousness you knowandand instinct viruses doing con consciousconscious uh decisions you know so forexample i think we humans we have a lotof instincts inside it's it's reallylike you know you have some input itgoes through the neural networkand it just has an output and you don'treally know why you know it's just thisis just happeningandand i think the problem is there oftenwe humans then have a lot of instinctsat the same timeand at the same time you have to youknow make a decision you have todecide which instinct you should followyou know the a very uh something ilearned in biology is like this you knowyou you have a little mouse here and youhave something to eat here and then hereyou have like a predator like an an owleating the mouthso the the mouse wants to has theinstinct to eat the cheese you know atthe same time the mouse has the instinctto to run away from the predator fromthe owl you know soand it has these two instinctsso so the mouse goes closer because itreally is hungry you know in one streetbut at some point it's getting too closeto the island it's getting afraid andyou know and thenand now what you know so in biology whatyou can observe the mouse hits there andthis doesn't know whether it should runaway or should go closerand these two instincts they are veryyou know they are not not veryintelligent they justeat or run away from the predatorand now i think this is now where theconsciousness comes in you know you havenow to make a decision what do you wantto do you knowand i think this is what it seems to mea little bit withyou know this search you know you youhave the you know you have thetf idf algorithm and you have you knowthe similarity search yeah likeinstincts you knowbut still to make decision you knowwhich one is now the best results thereyou need some kind of understanding andconsciousness in the sense like and ithink this isthis is what it seems to me is currentlya little bit missing you know you haveto these algorithms they returnsomething and sometimes they returngreat results you know but you're not sosure whether you can trust themand somehow you have to find a way whereyou can say okay yeah this really fitsand and andthat's why i'm saying i think there isnot a silver bullet i think you knowi think it's rather my my prediction israther you will have differentalgorithms which really have great youknowyeah greatthey deliver sometimes great results butyou still have to have like a higherlevel algorithm which then makes adecision based on these lower well thesemore instinctalgorithms you knowyou know what should it you know whichone should you trust and and i thinkthis is whatit seems to me and and i think this iswhat huma what why humans areintelligent in this sense you knowbecause humans are able to do this forwhatever reason you knowwhatever reason they have developed thisbut i think this is whyor whatever life form you have you knowlife form which is not justfollowing the instincts but you can makeuh decisions based on these variousinstincts and i think that the book ofkahneman just describes this very nicelyand we humans have a problem with thesetoo you know because we have to forceourselves to the slow thinkingour natural behavior is always to thinkfastand sometimes we are right you know butmany times we are wrong you know and weshould and i think with computers it'sthe same you i think you you have toimplement these kind of uhalgorithms i think yeahyeah and i love the um the searchapplication for studying neurosymbolicai and system one system two thinkingfast and slow i think search is one ofthe mostuseful ways to make progress on thiskind of way of thinking and so you couldthink of thinking fast and slow asthinking fast is where you have yoursiamese burnt and you're just doingvector distance comparisons and thenthinking slowly would be re-rankingwhere you say use a pairwise encoder sothe pairwise encoder it takes in twosequences as input and then has thecross-attention so it requires severalmore computations you wouldn't go hitthe whole data set with something likethat or you could even have like a trywise you can generalize that obviouslyas you do things like sparsetransformers long former increase thesize of your input window to to thinkslowly that way and so you could thinkof thinking slowly with neural layersand you could also think of the neurallayer as being the thing that tells youhow to traverse your retrieve than readpipeline it annotates the query it saysit has say you have a big system with 10different retrievers 10 differentreaders it can route through that byhaving some kind of labeled trainingdata and doing gradient descent learninga continuous representation of the spaceso you could have the neural layerthinking slowly or you can do these kindof symbolic processing things like saycausal inference ormaybe program synthesis i'm not reallytoo much of an expert of it myself i waswondering if maybe you could help meunderstand more about this kind ofthinking that the thinking slow thingshould be a symbolic computation i meanpre-coding some traversal over retrieveand read graph is a symbolic kind ofagain to be honest i really don't knowthis this is something we also try tofind out at the moment i i i really haveto be honest i don't know eitherhow exactly the slow thinking will workandi just think this isyeah i well you know maybe i'mcompletely wrong again if you take uhand if you compare again with the natureyou know i mean if you think aboutflying you know how how humans learn toflyyou know they they try to imitate birdsyou know they theythey saw thatyou know birds have wings but they alsoimitatedand today you know i mean we can todayhumans are able to fly you know in in 12hours from europe to brazil you knowwhich is fantastic no no bird can dothisbut still the plane still has you knowthe plane works differently than thebird but it still has wings you knowit'sso there's still we learn from thenaturebut the technology is slightly differentand we are more advanced than nature isbasically also of course forget aboutthethe climate change about the flight thisis not something we did so well or notdoing so well but let's apart from theclimate change you know thethe things we how we do this we reallydone this well but still it's very closein one way to the natureand i think this is the same i think iwould argue the same is probably truefor search you know and how we canfind things or how we can answerquestions you know but i tell youhonestly i don't know either how thisslow thinking what exactly you know howthis slow thinking i just think my god'sfeeling at the moment is really themagic is in understanding the questionyou know understanding what peopleactually are looking forkind of understanding a concept i thinkthis is also because you know i meanagain i know maybe this doesn't it's notdoesn't compare exactly but you knowif you think about a child i can show achild a zebraonce you know i don't have to show achild a zebra you know one million timesso that the child is able to recognizethe zebra i just show it once andand the child will recognize itimmediately again doesn't matter whetherit's in a different position and ofcourse there are some ambiguousmoments you knowdepending on the light and things likethat it will not maybe not recognizethis the zebra but generally it reallydoes recognize another thingi think in this sense i think we canstill learn a lot from nature and how wedo this and i think this is[Music]i think we're not quite there yet so buti think we we get there we i think it'smore a matter oftime andthat the climate change doesn't kill usin that before yeah i can't really tiethis back to the to how exactly i thinkthis will solve the problem of say uhone shot learning fuchsia learning yousee the zebra and i can generalize tonew zebra instances but this kind ofidea of say cellular automataself-organizing systems these kind of uhmessage passing regeneration things andlike and then the local kind of heavyand learning i think that could be apromising uhlike inspired by nature's solution to aii'm still i think it's tough tocompletely connect say heavy andlearning cellular automata to thensystem one system two and like let's goback to our retrieve and read way ofjustimagining such a system that we wouldwant to be inspired by but i had thiskind of idea with where say uh weinterviewed uh charles pierce fromkenius on the weev8 podcast and they'rebuilding a they have 60 million academicpapers that are connected in a citationgraph and so you i could i think maybeyou can model that as a cellularautomata system where uh you destroyparts of one of the paper and then itlocally re regenerates itself andthat kind of system maybe and i knowwe're kind of getting off topic fromretrieve and read but like what do youthink about cellular automata is kind ofa paradigm for aiyeah good question i don'ti again i really don't know i have toadmit iuh maybe you can because i think i'm noteven familiar with the concept can youcan you tell me a little bit more aboutthe concept yeah for anyone curiousabout this there's a really great uh thedistil publication distill.pub has avisualization of this with images whereuh they have like a lizard image andlike a smiley face image and you erase apita piece of it and it's it's like alocal regeneration module so it so itlearns how tobe you know recover from the damage ofthe eraser and soso it'sit's trying to emulate the idea of whereyou have like a local nested model withcomplexity that still does messagepassing to other local kind of nestedmodules andkind of the reason i brought this up iswhen you're thinking about this kind ofidea of nature inspired ai andi think maybe the cellular automata ideaand thinking about how that might pluginto something like a retrieved and readpipelineit's kind oflike a researchy idea i think of it asbut i think it could be a reallyinterestingkind of approach to it yeah no i i haveto admit i really don't know uh sorryi i can only tell that i think yeah wei mean again maybe that's why i'm aphysicist you know i think i'm very goodat oh yeah i think i'm very good atrecognizing patterns you know like thatyou can seeyeah just patterns you know and andandand uhi think once you can see this you knowyou can uhthat's why i'm saying this this exampleis the flying you know how we imitatednature and then we improved it beyondnature at least in one way you knowi think the samecan be true for you know ai basicallythat we see how nature is doing this andand that we try to imitate it but gobeyond it because i think nature is notperfect you know i meanit's far from perfect in the sense youknow and it took i don't know millionsof years to get there and and i thinkalso generally ourselves you know justbecause we have a great culture well wehave developed the culture i think wehumans our instincts are still very muchlike 10 000 years ago probably you knowwe just don't see these so much becausewe are they are kind ofbecause of culture we develop they arekind of hidden but if you are honestwith ourselves we are still veryinstinct-driven basicallyso i'm not saying nature is the bestpossible solution and uhand yes at the same time maybe we findanother way to do this completelydifferent than natureuh which is noti think don't i don't think i think wejust have to try all these possibilitieslike the one you just mentioned you knowi think we just have to give it a tryand see how far we get i think we justin the end it's evolution you know we wejust try see how things go and if itdoesn't go we we try another way or wetry them in you know parallel and wejust see how the things goand uhbut it just seems to me again you knowif you again if you take the you knowthe idea of evolution you know there'snot one way of doing it you know youknow there's multiple ways of doing andand somewhatever you call success you know someof are more successful than the othersand i think i think this is what we thatthat's why i'm saying with similaritysearch this is i that's why i think it'sgreat you know i mean i don't knowwhether you saw this somebody asked onthe the slack channel couldn't weimplement like uh tf idfinto vv8 you know and uh to have thiscombination you know and and uhand i understand very much why uhpeople who are asking for this and atthe same time i i really admire bob andhis team that they say well let's focuson the similarities search you knowthat they really say okay heyyou know we really want toget the most out of this and i thinkthat's that's really great i think andyeah we just have to try i think and andsee how far it goes andcombine the things and that at somepoint we justget that and bad dirtyandyeah with katie i think it's really imean ourgoal is reallyjust to you know to give you the bestpossible answer you know to to whateverquestion andthere i see still you know for simplequestions i think we we can stillalready give good answers but i have toadmit you knowonce you go intoyou know communicate chat channels likeslack or ms teams or whatever or you goon public mailing lists i mean you knowthis people don't ask just a goodquestion first they describe the problemyou know and sometimes this is veryunclear this problem and then they atthe end they say who can help me youknowandand this is really very tricky you knowit's very challenging to get out of thisand you can see this with humans youknow i mean even myself even if i'mare familiar with certain topics youknow i i really don't get the question ihave to ask what exactly do you mean youknow well can you describe this in alittle bit more detail i can give youcan you give me an example because youknow of course statistically i could sayokaythere's a limited set of answers or atleast i have a limited set of answers inmy knowledge base and i just give onewhich is the mostprobable you knowbut uh you know to givea really good answer i have to ask likesome counter questionsto to find out what does this personreally mean and then suddenly it becomesclear and then i say oh sorry yeah i idon't know the answer oh i can say yeahyeah of course this is the answer youknow this is this is exactly what youwant and say oh thank you very much youknowand i think this is really this isanother challenge and i think this isindependent actually of the actualsearch algorithm this is more aboutagain about understanding what does thisperson want yeah it answers the questionwell i'm thinking umlikewe recently interviewed malte peach fromhaystack and i think haystack'spipelines may be what someone is lookingfor if they want to use tf idf s bertbut um what we v8 has built and what i'ma strong believer in is they'veintegrated the symbolic filtering intothe neural searcheven though bm25 is as strong baselineas i've been kind of looking through theinformation retrieval literature and itdoes seem like you know bm25 is so astrong way to go i do suspect thatsymbolic annotation of neural querieswill win the win in the long term as youscale up the data sets is you know justthere it's still early and it's alreadybetter yes so i definitely think aboutthatand then um so another interesting thingabout the idea of like giving it anexample and really dressing up yourquestion with the context is i thinkkind of like the domain generalizationwhere uh me personally i'm working onmodeling uh keras code examples andkeras api references uh programminglanguage for deep learning and umlike subtleties in the way that you askthe question can really throw off themodel and is this something that you'veobserved and are thinking about is maybedata augmentationlike a generative model that can dressup the question in the training data sothat it has more kind of distribugeneralizationbut this kind of problem ofthe way you ask a question can reallyreally throw it off no i mean no you'redefinitely right depending on how youask a question this can completely uhlead to very long results this is thisis absolutely true we observe these twoandagain i think therei think it's really uhagain if you think about how we humansare doing this you knowi mean if you ask me a question you knowandi think again i think i can as a humani'm not able to understand somehow thisquestion is confusing you know in thesense like not i'm not saying i'm notblaming the other person asking thequestion it's just but it's confusingfor mebecause somehow i'm not i think iuh i'm able to understand this in mostcases you know sometimes i'm veryconfident andabout the question i and and i give youthe right answer sometimes i'm confidentabout the question i give you acompletely answer because ii was just too confident about whatyou're asking me you know and then theother person tells me no no michael thisis not what i meant i said oh yeah sorrythis was my first thinking you know i iwas thinking too fast you absolutelylike if i would have listened moreclosely to youuh yeah now i understand you you asksomething completely differentso but sometimes at the same time it's ithink what you were talking about isyeah i can feel i really don't reallyunderstand this question you know andthen i i really have to ask you conorwell is this what you meant and then youjust add a little bit more informationand then i say okay now it's clear to meand i think this isexactly what you're saying you know justif there's a little piece missing andthen it would be would become very clearand and if this little piece is missingit can lead to a completely differentsituationand but i think yeah and i think thesame is true for these models you knowwhen you're saying that it's completelythrowing off the modeli think there you know that's why i'msaying i think if you if you comparethis with our human things you can seewe humans are not much better actuallyour instincts are not much better or notbetter at allbut i think the difference is we areable to to you know we areconsciously we are able to understandthis and then we are consciously able toyou know counter ask a question and thenmake it clear and i think this is whatit seems to meyeah kind of missing in the computerworld you know that youi mean google is trying to do this and ithink quite well by saying well did youmean this or did you mean that you knowand and also of course you knowprofiling us they know when i'm askingfor java they know it's not the islandbecause they know from the history theyknow most of the time i'm asking for thetravel programming language soso in this sense uhi think they're already doing quite agood job but you're absolutely right andbut of course theyagain if you compare with a human youknow we have this conversation it's nota one-way thing it's it's ain going into both directions and ithink the same you knowis true i think for for such computersystems you knowi think this is why in the end yes itwill become a conversation maybe not aconversation like we have now but it'slike a conversation in order to clarifythe question and then once you haveclarifieduh you give a great answer so maybethere's a i can give you a very goodexample that's another use case we areworking on again it's a very simple usecase it's some of my friends they'revery much into cyclinguh and this is actually a coincidenceyeahthat yeah it's not because of me that ilike cycling they they just and theythey would like what they would like todo is really like a very simple thingyou know you have a problem with yourbicycle and you would like to find arepair shop which is able to do thisand you know i don't know how this is inthe u.s but you know here in europe it'soften like this depending on the branduh yeah you can't go to every repairshop some of the report shops they willtell youyou know sorry we don't cover this brandyou know you have to go to anotherrepair shopso but again you know the thing is likethis when i ask a question you know thisand this is broken where can i repairthisof course i will tell you there are like10 repair shops in your neighborhood butnow the thing is like from my experiencei knowdepending on your brand you knowi have to you know make anarrow more narrow selection so i willask oh yeah about conor i understandyour question but you know what brand doyou have do you have a scot bicycle ordo you have a track or do you have idon't know whatever you know anddepending on and then you say yeah yeahi have a scott you know and and thenokay then then i think it's best you goto this repair shop so so you know it'si think this is this kind ofconversation what i'm talking about youknow and i think this is uhand i think so it's not necessarily thethe problem of the modeli think it's moreuh because i think my model is notnecessarily better you know my humanmodel is not necessarily better than thecomputer model but it's more like thethe the the clear thehow do you see the clearness of thequestion you know the the understandingand i think this is why i'm sayingit's not necessarily important i thinktoof course the better the model isgreat you knowthe better the better but i think it'snot necessarily again i think it willnot necessarily solve the problem in theend i think it's more like thiscombination that you are able to clarifythe questions you know that you havethis conversation and i think this iswhy we humans are very good at you knowbecause we canwe have this abilityto clarify out of the fuzziness you knowto clarify the things and of course thiscannot just be by asking questions youcan also by looking at you you know byyou know depending what phase you makeyou know depending the temperatureyou know depending whether you have theweather conditions you know if you askme for an umbrella for example if youask me for an umbrellaif i seeyou at the beach you know this beautifulweather i know well you're not askingfor a random brother you're asking foran umbrellafor the sun you knowand i i guess that's why i mean you knowyou yeah i think so i think it's notjust the modelit's reallyyeah this ability to clarifywhat you're looking for actually yeah ilove that example of the beach beachversus say being in seattle for what isumbrella that that's such a greatexample of disambiguation but so i thinkthis is a great transition into thistopic ofmultimodal embeddings and how that canhelp you add context so in the exampleof looking for the bicycle repair shopit might be easier to have a tabulardescription of bike models rather thanputting it into natural language becauseif you set up the tabular schema fordescribing the bike and then you hit thedatabase of the tabular schemait seems more natural and maybe you wantto have a neural representation oftabular data as well but and then likeanother example would besay you go on something like instagramor pinterest and you see a pasta thatyou really like and you're trying toquery your local restaurants to see whowho can make this pasta for you in thatcase again the image is going to be somuch better than trying to have a textdescription of the pasta so i think thiskind of topic ofmultimodal not just text buttext maybe it's even uh in the lastpodcast with multi we talked about uhtables for searching through scientificpapers sotables you know and then or compared totabular data that you designed fordescribing a bike model and then againimages audio the facial expression theway you ask the question the tonality inthe way you ask the questionsuch an interesting kind of thing andhave you started thinking about likeintegrating other kinds of data thantext in in the kd system uh no not yetbecause we're not even there yet withthe you know the simple version of yeahno but you're absolutely right i thinkthis is uhyeah i think in the end uhthis is what it's going to evolve to youknow that we have these multi-modalinputs andand uhconversations i think and i think youknow again i think we humans we do thisveryunconsciously you know we we do these uhyou know we we're not even aware that weare doing this you know but thatactually we are doing this all the timeand we are so good at it that you knowit's againi'm really sorry if i might get offtopic again but you know wei think humans most of the thing thatthe consciousness is really just the tipof the iceberg you knowwe wei don't know i don't know how muchpercent but let's say 90 of the thingswe're doing unconsciously and based onthese unconscious things we make a lotof decisions anddo a lot of things weand and this is why we are soseem to be so intelligentso and i think these computers i thinkthis is the same thing you know i thinkweand i think this is why many peoplethink computers are limited you knowthey will never get like humans but ithink this is not really fair you knowbecause we don't really give thecomputers the input which the humanshave you know if you just think aboutour senses you know we have the you knowwe have the temperature we have thesense of you know wind or not wind wehave uhyou know all kind of sensors and this isall being fed into us and we give thisto process and based on this we can dosomething with computers we just havethe input of the data with the keyboardand that's it basically it means it'sclear that computers can with thislittle input you know i mean you can trythis on yourself if you only get verylimited input you know if you arelimiting yourself from a lot of inputyou you get completely lostand and in this sense i think this iswhy i think uhyeah it's just at the beginning in thissense that i think once computers havethis you know they can become much morepowerfuland again another example i think youknow we talk to each other we talk toourselves all the time you know i meanagain we don't program computers to talkto themselvesyou know again i think if you wouldprogram a computer to talk to oneselfthat computer could talk communicatewith itself you knowthis might would change a lot actuallyand so i think in this sense i thinkit's a little unfair actually how wetreat computer systems you know andat the same time you know i know manypeople are quite afraid of this you knowi'm not really afraid of this i i thinkyeah it's just a natural uhbut no i i we completely wish you thismulti uhthis multimodal thing i think this isand i think this year i think if evie isdoing this and uhi think that's really great i think soand yeah with katie i have to say at themoment we are focusing more on theuh one step after the other you know weare already very happy if you just can'tgive uh you know with somebody's askinga question and we can give the bestpossible answer you know andand i think then the next we justgo one stepafter the otherand i think yeah vvh can help us withthis and i think that's really great andif we can help deviate the other wayaround you know that we can share ourexperience which we are making we turnthis to viviateyou know i think we're very happy toshare this and i hope viviate willsucceed better with our you know ourexperience our observations basicallyyeah and we've eat has recently addedthe clip image tech support which iskind of like the first step i thinkaligning images and text will be thefirst probably step to combining allthese different modalities but i thinkyou're painting a really interestingkind of future for ai we have thingslike the perceiver i o architecture thatcan take in any kind of input data andhave this kind of latent uh latent arraythat it attends to to formrepresentation and integrate all sortsof data and then i think another reallyinteresting part of this is the role oflanguage in this and to me it startedwith the text-to-text transfertransformer the t5 model where theyshowed how you could unify all thesesupervised learning tasks through thelanguage modeling task so you just sayuh you just prepend it will say naturallanguage inference give it the twothings sentiment classification questionanswering like you just describe thetask as natural language and it makessense and it works and i and then um soeric jang recently wrote an articletitled just ask for generalization thatreally describes howthe way that i understand generalizationis there's kind of like two modes to itthere's robustness and corruptiontesting where you rotate an image addsome noise and all of a sudden it thinksthe panda's a dog and who knows why thathappens and that's a huge problem andthen the other side of generalization iscompositional generalization where whatmakes us so excited about things likeopen ai's dollyis that it's able to combine the conceptof avocado and armchair and avocadoarmchair and create that and create thatkind of image so the compositionalityand language is the interface forcompositionality as uh eric jangdescribes really well in the in thearticle just asked for generalization sothe idea of perceiver i o combining allsorts of different kind oftypes of data senses and then thelanguage interface for uh querying foreach for like accessing thatcompositionality of the multimodal dataand then yeah that idea of self play andmaybe reinforcement learning has a pieceto play in this as well but overall ithink this paints a really excitingpicture of kind of where ai is headed noi i agree no i think it's it's it's veryexcitingi have to say and i wish i have i wish ii would have started earlier with thesethings because i'm still i still have tolearn so much you know and it feels tome like you know when istarted physics you know i remember youknow i or when i did basic research youknow ai existed at this time but it wasveryyou know the neural networksit was not so advanced you know and ithink really over the last couple ofyears and i i have to say admit you knowi was like sleeping not a sleepingbeauty but i was kind of sleeping youknow and these things passedbeside me and then later i realized ohwow so many things happened and i reallyuh i iand i'm slowly i'm catching upand uhyeah but at the same time i see uh stillhugeyou know huge opportunities still youknow and i think we are far from uhyeah i think weand at the same time i see thelimitations of humans you know as i saidyou know myfor example uhyou know my wife she's originally frombrazil and you know and she'swhen i see how she has to learn germanand i have to see how i learn portugueseyou know it's it's crazy you know how wehumans have difficulty to learn anotherlanguage whereas you know if i seepeople or google translate you know howwell they do the translations just basedon feeding data into it you know and i iwish me as a human i would be like thisyou know i wish somebody could plug inthe portuguese language into my intomyself and i could just speak portugueseyou know and for me to just you knowjust learnsimple words i take so much time i takea couple of days just to remember themyou know and but then at the same timeit's it's crazy you know then once ihave some words suddenly i can makecombinations you know andand out of nowhere i i don't know whyyou know it's just happening and it'sit's really fascinating sono so i think it's i i agree completelyi think it's it's really fascinatingbut yeah i have to meet myself i i'm notai'm not an expert in many things i justhave to stillcatch up and learn anduh yeah and i hope he can contribute andi hope he can contribute back also toviviate as i said because i i reallyappreciate what vv8 is doing thatthey're doing this open source you knowand making things available because ireally think again i think this issomething important i think uhyou know with the bigger companies imean they have great knowledge i meanyou can see i mean google isyeah definitely the benchmark on i meanother companies too andi think you know without becoming toopolitical but i think these things thesetechnologies i think it's important thatnot just a few companies or not just afeworganizations have these i think it'simportant that this everyone is able toaccess this you know i think it's alittle bit like thehaving some human rights you know likeable to vote you know on a politicalsystem and i think with artificialintelligence i think it's the same thatyou really have this knowledge you knowand that this knowledge is being shareduhamong everyone you know and of course iunderstand from a company point of viewyou would you would like to have anadvantage you knowin order to earn money i mean foreveryone but i think these i think thisis why i think i appreciate very muchwhat v8 is doing that they share thisknowledge you know and really try toadvance this knowledge i think this isreally great yeah and i and i reallylike uh companies like mosaic ml that'sbuilding systems around efficienttraining of deep learning and i thinkthe big thing that's preventing it frombeing more democratic and everyonehaving access to it is the size of themodels if if you need to have 100billion parameters or you knowessentially like a million dollarmachine to do this then that's going tobe a huge problem and i recently made avideo on a title general purpose readerswhere i think this idea that we've eatis doing haystack these uh neural searchengines of decomposing the task intoretrieve then read componentsyou'll probably be able to you probablywon't need as much parametric complexityin the reader nowbecause it doesn't need to store thedata in the parameters so i think thisthis kind of idea of separating out thereader and then and then branding thereader as the general purpose kind of aiapi that can reason over any kind ofembedding space what as it generalizesto you know images text and all thatkind of stuff or like even like if wethink about robotics and howall the senses regarding that and so ireally think that kind of idea of areader api will be helped democratizethe kind of technology but so i thinkwe've covered so many uh research topicsin our podcast and and i'd love to haveyou on again later on as to keep thisconversation going but as we kind ofwrap this up could you tell me a littlemore about uh the future for katie andkind of what's on your road map thatyou're trying to build right now yeahsure but maybe if you don't mind justone remark you just said about what youjust said about you know these uhdemocratizing and about the large bigmodels i think they're again i'm not anexpert in this but you know again if ijust compare with nature you know ourbrain doesn't need so much energy andit's quite small and it's capable ofyou know great things so there my hopestill is of course that you knowi think the thing is like at the momentit feels to me like a little bit like weare doing 20s ai we're trying to do thison computers with uhyou know it's likeuh how's that let's say this but youknow it's like you use a tractor foragricultureto i don't know toto to go drive 10 000 kilometers ofcourse it will take you a long time youknowandit seems to me i think i could imaginethat uhyou know that that the the info the thehardware that these will all you know ifyou are able to change the hardware youknow like processes or whatever and youknow that they are more optimized for aithat this will also change things youknow and make things more democratic andit seems to me that as far as i knowgoogle is working on this that they havespecialized aiwhateverprocessesand i could as i said i'm not an expertin this but i could imagine you knowthat we are currently trying to dothings on infrastructure and hardwarewhich is not really made for these kindof things and if he actuallyyou know if he changed this then thiscould really suddenly change everythingas well you know suddenly the thingswe're trying to do becomes accessiblefor everyone very easilyandjust yeah tojust to have this but coming back toyour question about uh the road map yeahso the world map at the moment is reallyi thinkme personally i really would love tohave haitithat we can just use it you know insideyou knowpublic mailing this uh public flagchannels you know and really just try tomake an improvement there you know thatuhthat katie you know just could be like asuperhuman you knowunderstanding these questions you knowgiving great answersand just making life easier for peoplein these areas because as i said youknow i think it's a little bit sadthat i mean i know this from manyprobably middle east you know that uhyou know people many peoplepsychologically they don'tthey they are afraid to ask questionsbecause they might look stupid you knowtheythey they rather spend hoursyou know searching you know googling orwhateveruhand not finding the right answer butjust asking a simple question you knowwhich somebody who has this knowledgecould answer andand i think this would really be greatuh if he could solve or improve thisproblem i think this would really begreat i think thatthat's one thing on the world map andthe other thing is really to make senseof conversations you know i mean youhaveyou have a lot of conversations going onbut you know of course humans are lazythey don't want to document you know thethe key findings you know i remember wehad on uhyou know like15 years ago i was part of this cocoonit's cocoon is an apache softwarefoundation project which doesn't isn'treally very active anymore but you knowat the same time i rememberpeople were asking questions and theneventuallythere was a good answer you know andthen always people said you know let'slet's take this answer with summary orgood answer so that people know this isreally the answer they don't have toread like a thread of 100 emails to getto the right answerand again you know of course nobody wasdoing this maybesome discipline people they said okaythis is the summary is a good answersome some people maybe even documentedthis in the wiki or somewhere but let'sbe honest you know humans are quite lazytheyyou can tell them as much as as you wantthey don't do this and they're not badpeople but they're just lazy and i thinkif katie couldget sense out of these big conversationsand create summaries and then you knowprovide this again as good answers imean this would be a huge help and youknow i mean you know again if youcompletelycompare it with thenot computer world you know it's likephysical cleaning if i have a vacuumcleaneryou knowvacuum cleaner is a great invention youknow i don't have to do everything byhand you know i just clean it you knowwith the vacuum cleaner goes much fasterso and if i it again this is something ithink that we really make sense out ofthese conversations which are happeningin public mailing lists or publicchannels uh this would be great and thenof course for us earning money you knowi meanyeah i think yeah somehow somewhere wehave to pay the salaryand if we can sell these technologies tothe companies you know which haveinternally the same problems you knowbecauseif you have bigger corporations you knowthey have also the same thing you knowthey have uh people talking to eachother and you know uhthere we can apply the same technologyand if they pay us for this you knowthat they can use our software for thisthen the better you knowand uhyeah so that's basically on the roadmapto just uh improve these things and inthe end make life easier you know thatyou can spendyour time on other things basically andyeahuh you know again it's uhif you uh another comparison is you knowhere i don't know about the us but iguess it's similar in the s but here inswitzerland if you go to the shop youknow you can do the self checkoutyou know of course people were veryafraid that the people that peoplecounting the things you know andthat they lose their jobs but i don'tthink this happened actually you knowthey justare able to do other things you know andand i can do the self-checkout it's muchfaster and and it's really great andyou know and i think it'si think it's rather that you pay thesepeople you know i mean and the reasonthat people do these jobs because theydon't have such a good education and ithink we rather spend the money ongiving people a better education andthey can do something which is moremeaningful and well meaningful in thesense like you knowuhyeah not not something which machinescould do and i thinki think the same is with haiti you knowif he can doimprove these things and people then canspend their time on other things i thinkgreat i thinkand yeah unless they want to do thesethings then they can still do this ofcourse i'm notso don't get me wrong it's not it's notabout replacing people it's really justsupporting people and making life easiersoand i thinkmy life becomes easier you know if idon't have to search two hours forsomethingand i just take two minutes to find theright thing i mean great i think yeahi can go to the forest you know and andwalk there andyeah i think it i think it's such a likea noble mission statement and thisproblem you're solving is so importantand i you know you've communicated itvery clearly i think everyone wouldagree with the importance of this onequestion i had and i i hope this isn'tlike giving away the trade secret of itbut how easy is it to get the data fromslack into your database is the slackoffer an easy api to just take yourslack conversations and just have it asajson file or whatever yeah it's likeit's actually i have to admit was to sayuh uh all credits to slack is actuallyvery easy you know it's it's alsouhthe if you you can't dislike you youjust ask for the permissions you knowand that you get the content you knowand then basicallywe just read everything and we just tryto detect questions you know and againyou can do this in amore less sophisticated or moresophisticated way you know the the lesssophisticated way that the leastsophisticated way is you just look for aquestion markthen a little bit more sophisticated youyou look for words like who where whenwhy these kind of things in thecombination and of course the moresophisticated way again you you send thedata through some neural network whichis doing some classification of the youknow the communication and then we'llsay ah this is a question for examplethis is like a question abouti don't know something about these aboutsomething about these like these noslack is really good about these theyare really good ms teams they're alittle bit more restrictivethere you only get the content at leasti talked to microsoftand they said you only get the contentif you directly you know if you say heykatie you know and thenyou really have to address it to katieto that katie is getting the contentotherwise you can't read the wholecommunication which i think is a littleyeah it i think it would be nice if youcould read the whole communicationuhthen the other thing metrics i don'tknow if you know metrics metric is likean open source uh chat uh it's more likeemail you know federated uhmatrix is really great too but withmetrics you have to pull the content butof course this you can doand this email is the same you know youjust pull the content basically you knowyou you you justwhat katie is doing you know it'sbasicallyuh you know just subscribing basicallyto to imap you know and just pulling thecontent and then analyzing it andwriting it back you know just like whatyou do as a human you know basicallyuh so it's the sameso uhno actually this is quite easy but yesyou have depending on the channel youhave to do this differently for eachchannel so that's a little bitit would be nice if this would be alittle bit more standardized but it'sit's okay and no i have to say it's likeit's really good it's it's probably theopposite you knowthat people are sometimes afraid thatkatie is learning too much you know fromthese things and people are little butyou know it's funny again it's verypsychological because you as a human arereading these too you know what i meanis like if you are in ain the vva channel you you will readthese messages too you know so whyshouldn't katie read these messages youknowuh i think there's still this uhfear thatthat that computers are doing somethingbad with this information you knowwhereas humans could do just the sameyou knowuh and and this is actually quiteinteresting that thatbut yeah of course and uhbut i think this is more like a topicfor you know uhyeah privacy you know the privacy issuesthat you just follow certain privacyissues just as you require from humanstoo you know it's like when you aresayingthat uhyou know if you work in the company andyou have to sign a confident confidenceconfidence confagreement for being confidential youknow and uh i mean and of course youhave to do the same thing with thecomputer that you know that you makesure this data is well protected andit's not being misused andand i think asthen of course but there i have to admityou know onceyou know if i could hack your brain youcould i could only get your informationof course with a computer that's alittle bit more difficult if you are ina company with let's sayyou know like for example one thing isabout the private bank which might has 2000 employees you know and the computeris collecting all the data from these 2000 employees and somebody is able tohack into this you have the informationof all of them you know whereas if ijust can get connect with you i onlyhave your information i don't have theinformation of the 1999people otherwise i mean this isto be fair that's the difference youknow these computers you you are abledependingyou're able to get much more informationthan just from one person you knowand and i think this is something wehave to be yeah careful with andand i have to me but this is again whatwe do with katie we really have thisyou know we have every knowledge baseit'scompletely separated you know we don'tshare the data between the knowledgebases you know it's not it's not likeone big brain but basicallyevery knowledge base is dedicated uhdata container basically so because wewant to make sure that you know ifsomebody says no let's delete this datayou hit the button and it's deleted youknow instantly basically and you don'thave to see oh how was this connectedwith these intensities yeahso this is something we really try totake good care of yeah but of coursemistakes can happen and yeah i'd love tosee like um similar to how we all trustsay the stripe api with payments i'dlove to see some kind of federatedlearning company emerge whereyou you go to aproduct like katie and you see it's likethe data is managed withcompany name and it's like a dataprivacy for deep learning kind of apithat we all trust i'd love to see thatkind of thing exist to solve this kindof problem no i think it's a i agreewith you that you know that is really uhit's a challenge and i think it's uh ithink you have to define this as arequirement you know as a strictrequirement if you don't define this asa strict requirement people will starttonot do this so well you know not soproperly and in the end it's not becausethey're evil it's just because theydon't think about this you know and ithinkyou have to be very clear about this andyeah i think this changed very much andi have to say you know maybe inswitzerland this is a little bit more uhobvious i don't know i don't know i'mjust saying in switzerland because youknow there's uh the banks are very muchabout privacy the banks and theinsurance companies they are very aboutprivacyand so they are really forcing you to dothese you know and and even sometimes itsounds a little silly how they you knowbecause they areuh but but it's in this sense it's agood thing because they're reallyforcing you to think about this and uhand uh yeah i think generally it's veryimportant uh also again i think privacyis a very important thing also on thelevel of humans you know it's i thinkdoesn't matter yeahi i know it can be also have theopposite side you know but i think stilli think it's an important very importantthing and i think you have to have thisas a requirement from the very beginningso yeah so thatto ask kind of more of a personalquestion about the development of thisthing obviously katie this mission isvery big this this kind of thing youknow if it's built it could be sovaluable what's kind of like your umday-to-day like the level of how muchwork is going into developing this kindof a thing and the organization of katyi'd imagine scaling it up to building awhole company around this and what'syour thinking about all that kind ofstuff of uh you know really bringingbecause it's such a powerful vision isee it asrequiring almost maybe like a herculeanefforti mean a lot of these things like youknow alleviate and uh other tools helpfacilitate it but how much how hard isthis to really bring this to life well ithink at the momentwe are quite lucky actually we have uhthe seed funding we receivedthe investors are very very nice peoplein this senseand uh they're not like you know they'renot pushing us tolet's say you know to make a profityou know very soonin this sense i think i think what ismost important at the moment for us isjust to showthat this could really work you knowthat this reallymakes sense you know and it could reallywork we are able to pull this offandthat yeahit it it does create an improvement andthen that people start to see thepotential you know i think this is themost important andbut i have to say at the moment we arestill uh i wish we could spend more timeon the fundamentals you know like thesefor example this concept ofunderstanding that weuhyeah to develop this concept ofunderstanding of a question and thenbasically out of this on this concept ofunderstanding making a query and thisconscious process of you know making aselection of these different algorithmsthis is something i hope we will be ableto spend more time soon at the moment weare still spending a lot of time on thethe more the the regular things actuallylike you know what you were asking howto connect to channels like slack andyou know because the thing isuh honestly you know in order to to makethis uh that it work we need the data weneed that people start interacting withit you know also this is why i i reallyappreciate very much viviate that theyallow usto use the vva channel the reviewchannel i think is a great use casebecause they are like 300 or moremembers and people ask a lot ofquestions you know and it's really sucha great use case to test itand and i think this is very importantfor us so but i think now we are gettingreally close to thisthat we have the the the fundamentals toto do these things to get theinformation and to answer that reallypeople start interacting with it i knowthis sounds a little silly but it it'squite a lot of work actually it soundsvery easy from the outside but there'sso many detailsand then also like for example with thisinsurance company they're really alsothey're really doing this too andthey're very uh enthusiastic about itand uhbut at the same time you know we alsohad someuhsetbacks you say this and you know thatfor example we had one company they alsoused they also used like very much youknow and we were we had great hopesactually but we had to find out that youknow they only use slags for socialinteraction you know they only use likein the sense like hey when do we go forlunch heywhen when does this person has birthdayuh you know who who restarted the serveryou know it's it's a lot of questionswhich katie can't answer because youknow i mean i can't katie can't answerwhen we should go for lunch you knowsoso uh so i we had to realize you knowdepending on the situation you knowthese convocation can't scan channelsthey don't they're not being used for uhknowledge with which katie can make anysense of basically you knowand but this was a very important lessonlesson to learn so for example what welearned there isa very important lesson we learned wasthat yeah really we have to analyze thecommunication we have to be able toanalyze the communication and then seedoes this communication actually makesense you know in the sense like forkatie you know does it actually is itactually uhyou know again you know like if you haveuhyou knowif you have a road bicycle you know butyou live in the mountains without anyvotesyou know you can have a fantastic roadbicycle but it doesn't make sense itjust doesn't make sense because in themountains there are no streets and it soyou need a different tool you know to dothis so and this again it sounds sillybut this was an important lesson tolearn then the other important lesson tolearn wasthat we have these uh three phases ofdeploying katy in the sense like youknow i mean you know this probably fromsiri you know many i mean i know i thinksiri and alexa are great you know butsometimes you can observe this manypeople they they play with you but theysay at some point uh well you know yeahi can i can use it for this and that butfor all the other things i can't use itand they get frustrated and they don'treally start use siri anymoreso what we learned is it's reallyimportant not to frustrate people sowhat we did is we have three phases ofkatie so when we deploy katy the firstthing is just to analyze you know wekatie is reading and analyzing thethings but you don't really see katieyou know it's just there listening youknow it's just like an employee you putinto a company and the employee doesn'tknow muchand you don't you know you just telljust observe and listen you know justlook and try to learn as much aspossiblethis is the first phase and the secondphase is basically to have a motivatedemployee a moderated kd so basically yousay okay now i think you learned enoughand now you should bebe to actually you should be ready toparticipate you know but in order not tonot make people angryuh you don't directly answer but show meyour answers first basically and youknow and thenthe humans can basically moderate katieso if katie uh is providing a goodanswer then they say okay yes this is agood answer just put send it you knowbut if it's not good you have to correctit basicallyand once you get to the level that youcan see okay kd is really answering in agood way like let's say 95 of thequestions are good or 85 then youbasically let katie lose you know andyou just then katie is there you know soand i think these three phases are veryimportantand uh because otherwise you know youfrustrate people because they peoplethink okay first of first they think ohkg doesn't know anythingsecond they allsee always or he whatever he doesn'tprovide the right answers you know andand so they just say oh please turn itoff it's annoying you know so so i thinkit's very importantfrom a human point of view thatkatie you you only see katie at thistime when it really is good enoughbasically and this was also a veryimportant lessons we had to learn andand that's why i'm saying you knowi wish we could yeah well this took iknow now it sounds like okay why didn'tyou know this in the first place but itwas really things we had to experienceand and it took us some time to learnthese things and built into katybasically soand but and i think now we are veryclose to actually really spend more timeon these fundamental algorithms you knowlike what i said about the concept ofunderstanding and you know then usingdifferent algorithms and combining themand getting the most out of it and thisis this is going to be the next big stepandand i think then i think then i hope wereally have this we can proveand then i hope basically we can go tothe next round of financing or whateverbut yeah it's going to be a criticalpoint of view i tell you honestly ifyou're not able to prove this yeah it'suhyeah we i don't know how to continue butso far we have nice investors and theytrust us and i hope we can prove thisand i'm i'm very confident i'm veryoptimistic you know that we can do thisuhi think we just have to continue yeahit's so awesome it's such an excitingvision and so interesting for me to ilearned so much from this conversationand thank you so much for having it andthank you so much for coming on the wvapodcast really hope to see you again anduh check in in a little bit to see youknow how this is all coming together somany uh moving parts things indevelopment that are so exciting and thevision is so captivating of the kd thisquestion answering system in slackchannels and maybe a good place to uhdemo it out and illustrate it would bewith our we v8 slack channel which isreally the original inspiration for thispodcast between uh eddie and anaya's uhtrying to address questions from the weva chat in a podcast form so maybe thatwould be a fun thing for you tofor us to kind of integrate telling thestory of how this is coming togetherwell thank you very much thomas i reallyappreciate the opportunity totell about katie and how this workstogether with bb8 and i really again iwould like to thank you very much vivianfor giving us the opportunity and to useit you know i think he's reallyfantasticand i really hope that we can uh yeahthatwe can really learn as much as possiblefrom each other and share thisinformation and you know improveboth of us you know andyeah and i i yeah it's just i think it'sreally great thank you very much[Music]", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Podcast #5: How the knowledge management bot Katie leverages Weaviate",
