{"text": "Katie is a knowledge management bot, continuously improving, self-learning, and trained by humans. Under the hood, Katie is ... \nthanks for checking out the fifth \nepisode of the we vva podcast today i'm \njoined with michael weichner who's \nbuilding a really interesting system \ncalled katy which is a really exciting \nuse of these natural language processing \nvector search systems to answer \nquestions about uh business data and so \nin this podcast it's going to be a \nlittle different when we really dive \ninto a specific application \nand put together all the pieces of the \nvector search engine solution and the we \nvva database and understanding how to \nbuild these kind of systems end to end \nso michael thank you so much for coming \non the podcast and could you explain to \nus what the kd system is and what the \ngoals of it are oh yeah sure well thank \nyou very much for the invitation um \nyeah well maybe just to give you a \nlittle background how i got to katie \nactually i'm uh i'm participating in \nopen source for quite a long time i \nbecame apache software foundation member \n2004 \nwhereas at this time we did a content \nmanagement solution \nso i'm really part of various open \nsource \ncommunities for for many many years and \none of the big problems i think on \nmailing list is you know that \nmany people uh ask the same questions \nand i think it's it's good that they ask \nthese questions but then you know of \ncourse there are some people which get \ntired of these and then the answer is uh \nread the manual \nand \ni understand this but at the same time \nit's not so nice that people do this you \nknow and \nand so i often thought you know how can \nyou solve this problem that you know \nthat uh \nand you know a machine \na machine is much more patient than \nhumans you know so i i always thought if \na machine could be doing this this would \nbe great actually detecting you know \nduplicated questions and then answering \nthese also on mailing list or \nyou know chat channels like slack or \nwhatever i mean at these times like \ndidn't exist you had irc and \nuh similar things that's one that's one \nreason and then the other thing was like \ni \nfor most of the time i worked with \nwithin my own company \nand which which never you know like was \nnot like a huge company \nand then there was a time when i worked \nfor a bigger company which had like 600 \nemployees \nand there the first time i realized you \nknow if you are in a bigger company \nyou of course you know the people \nworking next to you are working in the \nteam but you don't know everyone at this \ncompany \nand then it's a similar problem you know \nyou had a question \nbut you don't know how to ask this \nbecause uh you know a slack channel with \n600 employees just doesn't scale it \ndoesn't work because you know if \neveryone would post \nyou couldn't and you know people would \njust get crazy and get out of the \nchannel and also these mailing lists \nit's similar and then so what's \nhappening you normally you you ask the \npeople around you you know like you \ncould be the person sitting next to you \nor people from your team and then you \nsay well how does this work and then \nthey say oh i don't know but ask this \nperson and then you know you you \ncontinue like this \nso again you know i was thinking how \ncould you solve this and \nthat so that's the other thing i \nobserved and then the other thing was at \nthis time at this company i worked on uh \nbasically i worked you know i did kind \nof research on conversational interfaces \nyou know like similar to siri and alex \nand these kind of things \nand uh we were doing prototypes and \nyou know \nvery simple things like for example then \nyou you know here in europe you have a \nlot of public transportation so you can \nsay you know hey siri tell me what is \nthe the next train going to decent this \ncity you know or how much does this cost \nand \nand these cases they worked quite well \nbut you know as soon as it's getting \nmore complicated you know for example if \nyou have to say something like you know \ni should be there at this point and you \nknow maybe i i don't know you have \ndifferent conditions \nuh you know that the things the chatbots \ndon't work so well anymore whereas \nhumans you know they really are able to \ndeal with the situation because they say \nuh okay maybe you mean these or what \nwhat exactly do you want and then by \nasking you a couple of questions and \nalso understanding the context you know \nhumans are able to deal with this kind \nof uh \nnot so clear conversation and and \nfuzziness so so i was thinking oh maybe \nmaybe it's just uh maybe we tried to \nsolve something which we are not quite \nthere yet even humans are able to are \ncapable of doing this so i thought oh \nyou know maybe we just concentrate on \ndetecting duplicated question if you're \nable to solve this problem \nyou know then we can make the next step \nand go beyond this so this is actually \nhow i started katie it's really i my \nfocus was just on \nyou know detecting duplicated questions \nyou know and trying to answer them as \ngood as possible which the idea is so \nyou know so you ask me a question for \nexample you know i i love mountain \nbiking like riding my mountain bike and \ndoing cross-country races so one one one \nquestion is there you know what are the \nbest tires you know to do country cross \ncountry race because uh you know you \nwant to be as fast as possible so and \nmany people ask this question and of \ncourse the answer is changing you know \nbecause there are new tires every year \nyou know that there are some they have \nall these little \nuh but still the question is the same so \nif if somebody's answering this question \nand you know somebody's asking the \nquestion again two days later you know i \ncan just pull it up so so that's that's \nthe the main focus of haiti and \nand then of course once you start doing \nthis you you very naturally you get into \nthis vector search area you know because \nuh \nyeah it's as i said you know the the \ntypical example would be you know when \ni'm asking you how old are you connor \nyou know \nit's and i'm asking two days later what \nis what is the age of conor you know \nthey are for us humans it's comple \nit's it's clear it's the same question \nyou know it's about your age but for the \ncomputer it's not so clear you know so \nand uh so this is i think where the \nsimilarity search comes in then you know \nit's um yeah that's that's it \nso on the first thing you said i it \nreminded me of this book a lot uh \nworking in public the making and \nmaintenance of open source software i \nreally recommend this to readers and um \nyeah it really describes that problem \nthat you're describing the first thing \nyou said about open source software \npeople asking the same questions and and \nthe kind of the strain on the developers \ntime of answering the same question over \nand over again i love hearing that story \nthis this idea of detecting duplicate \nquestions and that kind of motivating \nuse case i wanted to ask you if you saw \nthe the core question pairs data set and \nhow much that kind of academic data set \nguides your real world projects no i i \nsaw that i i to be honest i'm not uh i \ni'm subscribed to quora and i receive \nyou know quora keeps sending me \nnotifications about because i you know i \ni started physics many years ago like \ni'm actually a physicist i i didn't \nstudy computer science \nuh but maybe and i got very naturally i \nactually when i started physics i didn't \nlike programming so much \ni i was more like the you know pen and \npaper person \nbut then when i did basic research i did \ncomputer simulation so i had to get into \nprogramming and this was like yeah like \nlike 25 years ago \nand and i really loved it because i \nthink it's like building lego you know \nit's building things with lego you can \nbuild whatever you want without \nmuch money you know you don't need much \nyou just need a computer and that's it \nbasically \nand uh \nbut coming back to court and you know so \nan encore i receive a lot of uh \nquestions and answers regarding physics \nyou know people always ask things like \nyou know who's the \nbest physicist you know and how about \nthese theory and these kind of things so \nso these are actually but otherwise i \ndidn't use quora much but then i saw \nthat quora i think published this data \nset of i think 400 000 questions and \nanswers of course which is really great \nand uh at the same time very similar \nstack overflow where people ask you know \nquestions and answers \nand but there again you know what i saw \nis what i have observed the problem is \nyou know for example with stack overflow \neven if there are a lot of questions and \nanswers \nyou know you still for the same question \nyou get a lot of answers you know \nand and you not just and also again \nquestions are formulated differently you \nyou and in the end a human actually \nwould be able to consolidate these you \nknow if a human would really spend time \non this they would say okay here are \nfive questions they are actually the \nsame question you know but they're just \nformulated differently at the same time \nthere are \n20 answers \nand some of them are right some of them \nare not really right you know \nand again you know i i think this is no \ni mean i think it's great for and stack \noverflow they provide great amount of \ncontent \nto you know for us as a training and uh \ntraining set basically \nand also at the same time think about \nhow can we improve this because still \nwith stack overflow and quora i still as \na human \ni don't get a \nperfect answer you know like it's not \nlike and of course maybe sometimes there \nisn't a perfect answer because there are \nif you know it's like this again with \nthe mountain bike example you know \ndepending if i'm just asking what is the \nbest tire for cross-country race you \nknow there will not be one silver bullet \ntire you know that depending on the race \nconditions there can be different tyres \nso it's not a perfect but still a human \nwould tell you okay depending on this \ncondition this tire is really great or \nthis tire is really great and i think \nthe same is true with stack overflow \nsometimes and quara \nand for us this is really a great great \ndata you know which we can make use of \nand \nand \nbut our goal and maybe our promise is \nthat with katie we really are able to do \nthis better you know better than what we \nare able to do and i'm very confident \nthat we \nwe can do better we can even do better \nthan humans you know because \nuh these these computers uh we have the \npossibility that we really are able to \nprocess much more data than a human is \nable to process basically so \nwhich i think is really great actually \nyeah and it sounds interesting like um \nyou could get you could have like a \ncertainty threshold on the duplicate and \nif it's say \nuh like in between 70 to 80 then you \nwould ask for more context from the user \nand get even more kind of feedback in \nthat system but so the question that we \ntalk about on all every we vva podcast \nthat i'm curious about is so with a data \nset like cora question pairs 400 000 \nannotated examples of similar questions \na massive annotation scale you'd imagine \nbootstrapping something like that for \nyourself would be \nexpensive and difficult and \nso the question is does is that all does \nthat generalize a model that's trained \non \naligning the similarity between the core \nquestion pairs data set do you feel like \nyou need to fine-tune that for your use \ncase or do you feel like that \noff-the-shelf model just works right \naway i know we actually we have to find \nunit because just to give you an example \none of our customers is an insurance \ncompany you know for legal uh insurance \nyou know like let's say for example your \nneighbor \ni don't know for some reason made uh \nyou know the children of your neighbor \nhit your door and now the door is kind \nof damaged you know so then you call \nyour insurance company and say hey by \nthe way my neighbor did this and you \nknow what about you know and then you \nask these questions \nand so in the insurance company space \nthey have a lot of you know very \nspecialized terms \nyou know and very specialized situations \nwhich you will not find on quora you \nknow or we which will not find on stack \noverflow or whatever \nso and this data this is not available \npublicly you know i mean some of it is \nyou know some you know some regular \ncases \nor some more obvious cases they might be \npublic you mean us \nas far as i know for example google \nand tencent you know they try to get uh \nthey really tried to get into this \ninsurance space and also make it more \npublic but still there's a lot of \nspecial terms and \nspecial situations which are not public \nand you will not get \nthis data for free you really have to \nwork with these companies and even then \nthey are very hesitant to give this data \nout but of course if they want something \nlike katie \nto get good results they have to give us \nthe data otherwise we can i mean again \nbut to think about it yourself you know \nif you never worked in the insurance \nspace you will not know \nthe terms and the the situations which \nare happening there you know and so you \nare not able to \nyou even if you have like kind of a \ntransfer learning but you will not able \nto answer the things the questions so \nyou really have to get familiar with \nthese special situations and and you \nhave to fine-tune your models based on \nthese basically but but otherwise of \ncourse yeah that the learning itself is \nthe same you know whether it be the \ninsurance or whether it be uh \nyou know a medicine or whether it be \nphysics or whether it be just the \ngeneral public domain knowledge \nbasically so yeah it sounds like the \nproblem is the out of distribution of \nthe new words and uh even something like \na sub word or a byte pair encoder \ntokenizer still has to generalize to \nthese out of distribution tokens when \nyou go from say yeah core question pairs \nto legal documents or even stack \noverflow where \nyou might ask a question about a \nspecific python library that obviously \nis not in the core data set so it has to \ntry to generalize to some new tokens and \nobviously it has no basis to do that so \nmaybe like advances in tokenizers would \nhelp that but i i agree that it does \nseem like and there's a paper called \ndon't stop pre-training that i really \nlike that that talks about this further \nfine-tuning and so yeah i think i agree \nthat it seems like in most cases the \nfurther fine-tuning will be important so \nas you've been fine-tuning these models \nwhat have been some of the lessons \nyou've learned in training uh say \nsiamese bird style encoders are you a \nfan of using data augmentation or what \nkinds of things go into that fine-tuning \noh to be honest i i don't know i i'm not \nfamiliar enough to be honest with these \ndetails this is actually one reason we \nuse v8 you know \nbecause \ni really yeah i have to be honest i'm \nnot i i couldn't tell you this is \nsomething i well me personally i still \nhave to learn \nand at the same time we really try to \nyou know really learn from uh products \nor companies like bv8 you know to do \nthis so \nyeah i i really couldn't tell you i i \njust know i \nwhat i know although what i've learned \nis in this sense it's really \nyeah you do have to the context is very \nimportant you know it's like just you \nsaid python for example you know in \nprogramming python is a language but if \nyou go to \nyou know if you don't if you don't talk \nabout like let's say you are in \nagriculture you know python \npeople will not consider python in a \nlanguage they consider it an animal \nbasically you know so \nso \nuh \ni think in this sense the context \nunderstanding the context is very very \nimportant this is something i've learned \nand \nand also uh \nand \nand \ni think let's let's say this way you \nknow i think by understanding the \ncontext and uh \nyeah you can do much better answers \nbasically and you you have to somehow \nuse this also \nuh \ni try to let me try to think about you \nknow it's like my \nmy wife or my children are asking me a \nquestions question you know and if they \njust shout it across the room you know \nand i don't know the context it's very \nhard to answer these questions so i have \nto ask well what do you mean exactly \nare you asking because of this or asking \nbecause of this so also humans you know \nif you don't have the context you can't \nreally answer you can just make a guess \nstatistically of course \nyou know if they ask me all the time the \nsame thing or i already anticipate the \ncontext i can answer it but if it's \ncompletely out of con i'm not aware of \nthe context i can't really give you a \ngood answer except that i say okay with \nin 90 of the cases uh if somebody asks \nthis question this will be the answer \nbut it might be completely wrong because \ni don't know the context \nwell i think you've touched on another \nkind of part of this that is that is \nsuch an exciting part of these retrieve \nand read pipelines is how you can \ntake the query you can maybe use the \nsame kind of encoder for the query as \nyour document index and then return more \ndocuments you could have a user \nembedding you could maybe have a history \nof queries from the user and then you \nhave these pipelines where you might \nwant to further annotate the query \nwhether it's just with uh like late \nfusion with the \nyou know the latent spaces the \nembeddings that goes back into the \nretrieval component and you can put \ntogether these pipelines of having your \ndatabase having different retrievers \nwhether those different retrievers are a \nsymbolic sparse retriever tfidfvm25 or a \ndense dpr esbert or some kind of \nneurosymbolic search which is what we've \neat offers is by doing a you know esper \nlook up but also with symbolic filtering \nthese different kinds of retrievers you \nhave different ways of processing the \nquery itself and then different ways of \nthen reading from what's turned so as \nyou develop these pipelines for flowing \nthe data through to the end use case how \nhas that been in plugging these \ndifferent components together and how \nhas how much of \nlike what wev8 offers has kind of \nbootstrap this kind of end-to-end \npipeline well uh yeah maybe i can tell \nyou a little bit about the architecture \nabout katie you know how it works now \nand how we make use of vv8 and where we \nreally see the advantage of this \nso \nwhat my understanding right now is you \nknow i don't think at the moment and \nmaybe \ndon't get me wrong about \nit's really just my \nmy state of the art at the moment it \nseems to me there is no silver bullet \nyou know it's there's no one solution \nwhich \ngives you the perfect uh \nsolution basically \nand so what we did is the the way how we \nbuilt it uh the architecture is really \nthat we can plug in different algorithms \nvery easily \neven per \nyou know pair knowledge base you know \nlike for example in the insurance space \nwe can use a completely different \nalgorithm for the knowledge base of the \ninsurance or you know for \nfor frequently asked questions of apache \nlucene we can use \napache lucien by itself so so we \nrealized oh that's at least our opinion \ni think it's very important that we can \nvery easily change this exchange this \nyou know and even everyone can use their \nown version so vva for the vva \nfrequently asked questions we can use v8 \nyou know and see how far we get \nat the same time we can use different \nalgorithms at the same time you know and \nhaving different result sets and then \nyou know combining them somehow so this \nis one thing \ni think which is very important and i \nthink the other thing i think which is \nvery important and this is just \nobserving myself you know observing \nhumans you know how you process \nquestions and answers \ni think the magic is \nthe magic is really in understanding the \nquestion you know how we because once \nyou understand the question and this is \nsomething maybe we can talk about a \nlittle more in detail you know what does \nit actually mean understanding the \nquestion \nbut i think by understanding the \nquestion you can give a good answer \nand i think a very simple case is like \nyou know if you if if uh if you if \nsomebody would ask me how old is connor \nyou know \ni understand it's about the age of conor \nbut the point now is i know \ni don't have this information in my \nknowledge base you know in my knowledge \ngraph in my brain i know you you know i \nknow conor i know there is a corner and \ni know \nyou are the only corner i know but i \nknow i don't have this information in my \nknowledge base so \nonce i understand the question i can \ntell you oh sorry i don't know the \nanswer you know and this is for example \nsomething which search engines don't do \ntoday you know they always give you an \nanswer you know \nthey they never tell you oh sorry i \ndon't know i understand your question \nbut i don't know the answer \nand i think this is something which you \ncan see and i think it shows that humans \ndo this not just based on \nyou know uh uh uh uh \nprobabilities but they really by \nunderstanding you know of course they \ncan say okay maybe the answer is like \nthis and this but they still tell you \nactually i don't know \nand and i think this is also very \nimportant to understand so our goal at \nthe moment is really to to develop \nsomething \nlike a at the concept of understanding a \nquestion and i think there \ni think one of course one thing is \nreally named entity recognition you know \nagain if you if you take the example of \nyou know how old is corner you a simple \nnamed entity recognition is \nunderstanding corner is a human it's a \nperson you know and uh how old is it \nmeans it's about the age so once you \nhave these two concepts a person named \nconnor and the h you know then you can \ndo a normal query \nthere's no more \nyou know similarity search or whatever \nyou can go into a regular rational \ndatabase and just do a query and and if \nyou see there is no corner you know you \ncan say okay sorry i don't have an \nanswer you know even if i understand \nyour question \nso \nuh \nbut then of course uh you know when \nso if you use just similarity search in \na brute force version you know then then \nthe similarity search probably will \nreturn yeah there is something you know \nuh \nyeah this question how old is conor it's \nvery it's similar similar to the \nquestion how old is uh \ni don't know uh \nyou know uh cornelia i connelly is like \na \nfemale name i don't know i i don't don't \nget me uh \nuh maybe a better example is you know in \nin in in in \nenglish uh in german italia italian \nspace you have the name andrea and \nandreas you know or andrea for example \nandrea can be a female name or it can be \na male name \nso if you ask how old is andrea you know \nand if you have this answer \nuh \nin the database somehow you know \nand but somebody's asking how old is \nandreas \nprobably from the sentence embedding it \nit's very similar you know it's very \nclose to each other but actually \nit's very different because me as a \nhuman i understand andreas is a \ncompletely different person than andrea \nyou know because one is it could be male \nor female or the other is very sure it's \na male version you know so \nand i think this is something we really \nhave to be careful with and uh \nand i think this is something \nto be honest i don't know either yet how \nto do this best but uh but i think this \nis why i like vv8 very much because i \nthink what i think really is great about \nvva that v8 is really focusing very hard \non these you know and they're really \nvery dedicated on these and i think it's \nreally great to have this and that vv8 \nis doing this so yeah if i could pitch \nyou on maybe an idea to um \nan idea around this idea of say \ndisambiguation and named entity \nrecognition and then trying to \nunderstand how well your system is \nunderstanding your query i was thinking \nmaybe it could be interesting to have a \nvisualization of the graph structure of \nthe nearest neighbors to your query so \nuh when you do a query and you get an \nanswer that you know you like what's \ngoing on at this answer you could you \ncould look into the graph and you could \nsee the what h sw has returned and you \ncan see kind of the linking between the \ndistances between maybe it's your query \nand in the nearest say \nsentence or paragraph in the document \nindex or maybe it could even be and then \ncoming back to this idea of named entity \nrecognition disambiguation maybe it \ncould link to a word embedding as well \nand i don't think we've explored too \nmuch of doing the distances between \nentire contextual representations of \nentire sequences compared to the \nindividual word embeddings but i can \nimagine for this kind of thing where you \nhave a query like um \nmaybe it's like some kind of question \nabout some specific breed of tiger \nand that's and tiger is one of your word \nembeddings maybe you'd want to see that \nkind of thing on the graph to be like \nokay well it at least sees that i'm \ntrying to ask about a tiger and then \nmaybe you'd also want to plug it into a \ngenerative model \nlike a gbt that can generate a long \nsequence of text to to generate \nsomething that would have a high \nsemantic similarity according to your \nuh \nyour you know that latent embedding \nspace but then still have that be on the \nnatural language manifold and not just \nbe like adversarial noise to optimize \nthe similarity but some kind of like \ngraph visualization like that to give \nyou more understanding of \nhow your system has interpreted the \nquery well i i could imagine uh that \nthis could really happen i think \nlet's say this way i think there's still \na lot of \nroom space for improvement \nand just to give you an example uh maybe \nit's a little bit off topic but i think \nit's very similar you know about just \nunderstanding i think why humans are \nconsidered to be quite intelligent you \nknow not just humans \nand i think this you can see you know uh \nwhen you when you think about i mean i \ndon't know whether you know this book by \nuh conor man i think the slow and fast \nthinking \nand \ni think it's really a great book and \nbecause and i think it's also the \nquestion about consciousness you know \nand \nand instinct viruses doing con conscious \nconscious uh decisions you know so for \nexample i think we humans we have a lot \nof instincts inside it's it's really \nlike you know you have some input it \ngoes through the neural network \nand it just has an output and you don't \nreally know why you know it's just this \nis just happening \nand \nand i think the problem is there often \nwe humans then have a lot of instincts \nat the same time \nand at the same time you have to you \nknow make a decision you have to \ndecide which instinct you should follow \nyou know the a very uh something i \nlearned in biology is like this you know \nyou you have a little mouse here and you \nhave something to eat here and then here \nyou have like a predator like an an owl \neating the mouth \nso the the mouse wants to has the \ninstinct to eat the cheese you know at \nthe same time the mouse has the instinct \nto to run away from the predator from \nthe owl you know so \nand it has these two instincts \nso so the mouse goes closer because it \nreally is hungry you know in one street \nbut at some point it's getting too close \nto the island it's getting afraid and \nyou know and then \nand now what you know so in biology what \nyou can observe the mouse hits there and \nthis doesn't know whether it should run \naway or should go closer \nand these two instincts they are very \nyou know they are not not very \nintelligent they just \neat or run away from the predator \nand now i think this is now where the \nconsciousness comes in you know you have \nnow to make a decision what do you want \nto do you know \nand i think this is what it seems to me \na little bit with \nyou know this search you know you you \nhave the you know you have the \ntf idf algorithm and you have you know \nthe similarity search yeah like \ninstincts you know \nbut still to make decision you know \nwhich one is now the best results there \nyou need some kind of understanding and \nconsciousness in the sense like and i \nthink this is \nthis is what it seems to me is currently \na little bit missing you know you have \nto these algorithms they return \nsomething and sometimes they return \ngreat results you know but you're not so \nsure whether you can trust them \nand somehow you have to find a way where \nyou can say okay yeah this really fits \nand and and \nthat's why i'm saying i think there is \nnot a silver bullet i think you know \ni think it's rather my my prediction is \nrather you will have different \nalgorithms which really have great you \nknow \nyeah great \nthey deliver sometimes great results but \nyou still have to have like a higher \nlevel algorithm which then makes a \ndecision based on these lower well these \nmore instinct \nalgorithms you know \nyou know what should it you know which \none should you trust and and i think \nthis is what \nit seems to me and and i think this is \nwhat huma what why humans are \nintelligent in this sense you know \nbecause humans are able to do this for \nwhatever reason you know \nwhatever reason they have developed this \nbut i think this is why \nor whatever life form you have you know \nlife form which is not just \nfollowing the instincts but you can make \nuh decisions based on these various \ninstincts and i think that the book of \nkahneman just describes this very nicely \nand we humans have a problem with these \ntoo you know because we have to force \nourselves to the slow thinking \nour natural behavior is always to think \nfast \nand sometimes we are right you know but \nmany times we are wrong you know and we \nshould and i think with computers it's \nthe same you i think you you have to \nimplement these kind of uh \nalgorithms i think yeah \nyeah and i love the um the search \napplication for studying neurosymbolic \nai and system one system two thinking \nfast and slow i think search is one of \nthe most \nuseful ways to make progress on this \nkind of way of thinking and so you could \nthink of thinking fast and slow as \nthinking fast is where you have your \nsiamese burnt and you're just doing \nvector distance comparisons and then \nthinking slowly would be re-ranking \nwhere you say use a pairwise encoder so \nthe pairwise encoder it takes in two \nsequences as input and then has the \ncross-attention so it requires several \nmore computations you wouldn't go hit \nthe whole data set with something like \nthat or you could even have like a try \nwise you can generalize that obviously \nas you do things like sparse \ntransformers long former increase the \nsize of your input window to to think \nslowly that way and so you could think \nof thinking slowly with neural layers \nand you could also think of the neural \nlayer as being the thing that tells you \nhow to traverse your retrieve than read \npipeline it annotates the query it says \nit has say you have a big system with 10 \ndifferent retrievers 10 different \nreaders it can route through that by \nhaving some kind of labeled training \ndata and doing gradient descent learning \na continuous representation of the space \nso you could have the neural layer \nthinking slowly or you can do these kind \nof symbolic processing things like say \ncausal inference or \nmaybe program synthesis i'm not really \ntoo much of an expert of it myself i was \nwondering if maybe you could help me \nunderstand more about this kind of \nthinking that the thinking slow thing \nshould be a symbolic computation i mean \npre-coding some traversal over retrieve \nand read graph is a symbolic kind of \nagain to be honest i really don't know \nthis this is something we also try to \nfind out at the moment i i i really have \nto be honest i don't know either \nhow exactly the slow thinking will work \nand \ni just think this is \nyeah i well you know maybe i'm \ncompletely wrong again if you take uh \nand if you compare again with the nature \nyou know i mean if you think about \nflying you know how how humans learn to \nfly \nyou know they they try to imitate birds \nyou know they they \nthey saw that \nyou know birds have wings but they also \nimitated \nand today you know i mean we can today \nhumans are able to fly you know in in 12 \nhours from europe to brazil you know \nwhich is fantastic no no bird can do \nthis \nbut still the plane still has you know \nthe plane works differently than the \nbird but it still has wings you know \nit's \nso there's still we learn from the \nnature \nbut the technology is slightly different \nand we are more advanced than nature is \nbasically also of course forget about \nthe \nthe climate change about the flight this \nis not something we did so well or not \ndoing so well but let's apart from the \nclimate change you know the \nthe things we how we do this we really \ndone this well but still it's very close \nin one way to the nature \nand i think this is the same i think i \nwould argue the same is probably true \nfor search you know and how we can \nfind things or how we can answer \nquestions you know but i tell you \nhonestly i don't know either how this \nslow thinking what exactly you know how \nthis slow thinking i just think my god's \nfeeling at the moment is really the \nmagic is in understanding the question \nyou know understanding what people \nactually are looking for \nkind of understanding a concept i think \nthis is also because you know i mean \nagain i know maybe this doesn't it's not \ndoesn't compare exactly but you know \nif you think about a child i can show a \nchild a zebra \nonce you know i don't have to show a \nchild a zebra you know one million times \nso that the child is able to recognize \nthe zebra i just show it once and \nand the child will recognize it \nimmediately again doesn't matter whether \nit's in a different position and of \ncourse there are some ambiguous \nmoments you know \ndepending on the light and things like \nthat it will not maybe not recognize \nthis the zebra but generally it really \ndoes recognize another thing \ni think in this sense i think we can \nstill learn a lot from nature and how we \ndo this and i think this is \n[Music] \ni think we're not quite there yet so but \ni think we we get there we i think it's \nmore a matter of \ntime and \nthat the climate change doesn't kill us \nin that before yeah i can't really tie \nthis back to the to how exactly i think \nthis will solve the problem of say uh \none shot learning fuchsia learning you \nsee the zebra and i can generalize to \nnew zebra instances but this kind of \nidea of say cellular automata \nself-organizing systems these kind of uh \nmessage passing regeneration things and \nlike and then the local kind of heavy \nand learning i think that could be a \npromising uh \nlike inspired by nature's solution to ai \ni'm still i think it's tough to \ncompletely connect say heavy and \nlearning cellular automata to then \nsystem one system two and like let's go \nback to our retrieve and read way of \njust \nimagining such a system that we would \nwant to be inspired by but i had this \nkind of idea with where say uh we \ninterviewed uh charles pierce from \nkenius on the weev8 podcast and they're \nbuilding a they have 60 million academic \npapers that are connected in a citation \ngraph and so you i could i think maybe \nyou can model that as a cellular \nautomata system where uh you destroy \nparts of one of the paper and then it \nlocally re regenerates itself and \nthat kind of system maybe and i know \nwe're kind of getting off topic from \nretrieve and read but like what do you \nthink about cellular automata is kind of \na paradigm for ai \nyeah good question i don't \ni again i really don't know i have to \nadmit i \nuh maybe you can because i think i'm not \neven familiar with the concept can you \ncan you tell me a little bit more about \nthe concept yeah for anyone curious \nabout this there's a really great uh the \ndistil publication distill.pub has a \nvisualization of this with images where \nuh they have like a lizard image and \nlike a smiley face image and you erase a \npita piece of it and it's it's like a \nlocal regeneration module so it so it \nlearns how to \nbe you know recover from the damage of \nthe eraser and so \nso it's \nit's trying to emulate the idea of where \nyou have like a local nested model with \ncomplexity that still does message \npassing to other local kind of nested \nmodules and \nkind of the reason i brought this up is \nwhen you're thinking about this kind of \nidea of nature inspired ai and \ni think maybe the cellular automata idea \nand thinking about how that might plug \ninto something like a retrieved and read \npipeline \nit's kind of \nlike a researchy idea i think of it as \nbut i think it could be a really \ninteresting \nkind of approach to it yeah no i i have \nto admit i really don't know uh sorry \ni i can only tell that i think yeah we \ni mean again maybe that's why i'm a \nphysicist you know i think i'm very good \nat oh yeah i think i'm very good at \nrecognizing patterns you know like that \nyou can see \nyeah just patterns you know and and \nand \nand uh \ni think once you can see this you know \nyou can uh \nthat's why i'm saying this this example \nis the flying you know how we imitated \nnature and then we improved it beyond \nnature at least in one way you know \ni think the same \ncan be true for you know ai basically \nthat we see how nature is doing this and \nand that we try to imitate it but go \nbeyond it because i think nature is not \nperfect you know i mean \nit's far from perfect in the sense you \nknow and it took i don't know millions \nof years to get there and and i think \nalso generally ourselves you know just \nbecause we have a great culture well we \nhave developed the culture i think we \nhumans our instincts are still very much \nlike 10 000 years ago probably you know \nwe just don't see these so much because \nwe are they are kind of \nbecause of culture we develop they are \nkind of hidden but if you are honest \nwith ourselves we are still very \ninstinct-driven basically \nso i'm not saying nature is the best \npossible solution and uh \nand yes at the same time maybe we find \nanother way to do this completely \ndifferent than nature \nuh which is not \ni think don't i don't think i think we \njust have to try all these possibilities \nlike the one you just mentioned you know \ni think we just have to give it a try \nand see how far we get i think we just \nin the end it's evolution you know we we \njust try see how things go and if it \ndoesn't go we we try another way or we \ntry them in you know parallel and we \njust see how the things go \nand uh \nbut it just seems to me again you know \nif you again if you take the you know \nthe idea of evolution you know there's \nnot one way of doing it you know you \nknow there's multiple ways of doing and \nand some \nwhatever you call success you know some \nof are more successful than the others \nand i think i think this is what we that \nthat's why i'm saying with similarity \nsearch this is i that's why i think it's \ngreat you know i mean i don't know \nwhether you saw this somebody asked on \nthe the slack channel couldn't we \nimplement like uh tf idf \ninto vv8 you know and uh to have this \ncombination you know and and uh \nand i understand very much why uh \npeople who are asking for this and at \nthe same time i i really admire bob and \nhis team that they say well let's focus \non the similarities search you know \nthat they really say okay hey \nyou know we really want to \nget the most out of this and i think \nthat's that's really great i think and \nyeah we just have to try i think and and \nsee how far it goes and \ncombine the things and that at some \npoint we just \nget that and bad dirty \nand \nyeah with katie i think it's really i \nmean our \ngoal is really \njust to you know to give you the best \npossible answer you know to to whatever \nquestion and \nthere i see still you know for simple \nquestions i think we we can still \nalready give good answers but i have to \nadmit you know \nonce you go into \nyou know communicate chat channels like \nslack or ms teams or whatever or you go \non public mailing lists i mean you know \nthis people don't ask just a good \nquestion first they describe the problem \nyou know and sometimes this is very \nunclear this problem and then they at \nthe end they say who can help me you \nknow \nand \nand this is really very tricky you know \nit's very challenging to get out of this \nand you can see this with humans you \nknow i mean even myself even if i'm \nare familiar with certain topics you \nknow i i really don't get the question i \nhave to ask what exactly do you mean you \nknow well can you describe this in a \nlittle bit more detail i can give you \ncan you give me an example because you \nknow of course statistically i could say \nokay \nthere's a limited set of answers or at \nleast i have a limited set of answers in \nmy knowledge base and i just give one \nwhich is the most \nprobable you know \nbut uh you know to give \na really good answer i have to ask like \nsome counter questions \nto to find out what does this person \nreally mean and then suddenly it becomes \nclear and then i say oh sorry yeah i i \ndon't know the answer oh i can say yeah \nyeah of course this is the answer you \nknow this is this is exactly what you \nwant and say oh thank you very much you \nknow \nand i think this is really this is \nanother challenge and i think this is \nindependent actually of the actual \nsearch algorithm this is more about \nagain about understanding what does this \nperson want yeah it answers the question \nwell i'm thinking um \nlike \nwe recently interviewed malte peach from \nhaystack and i think haystack's \npipelines may be what someone is looking \nfor if they want to use tf idf s bert \nbut um what we v8 has built and what i'm \na strong believer in is they've \nintegrated the symbolic filtering into \nthe neural search \neven though bm25 is as strong baseline \nas i've been kind of looking through the \ninformation retrieval literature and it \ndoes seem like you know bm25 is so a \nstrong way to go i do suspect that \nsymbolic annotation of neural queries \nwill win the win in the long term as you \nscale up the data sets is you know just \nthere it's still early and it's already \nbetter yes so i definitely think about \nthat \nand then um so another interesting thing \nabout the idea of like giving it an \nexample and really dressing up your \nquestion with the context is i think \nkind of like the domain generalization \nwhere uh me personally i'm working on \nmodeling uh keras code examples and \nkeras api references uh programming \nlanguage for deep learning and um \nlike subtleties in the way that you ask \nthe question can really throw off the \nmodel and is this something that you've \nobserved and are thinking about is maybe \ndata augmentation \nlike a generative model that can dress \nup the question in the training data so \nthat it has more kind of distribu \ngeneralization \nbut this kind of problem of \nthe way you ask a question can really \nreally throw it off no i mean no you're \ndefinitely right depending on how you \nask a question this can completely uh \nlead to very long results this is this \nis absolutely true we observe these two \nand \nagain i think there \ni think it's really uh \nagain if you think about how we humans \nare doing this you know \ni mean if you ask me a question you know \nand \ni think again i think i can as a human \ni'm not able to understand somehow this \nquestion is confusing you know in the \nsense like not i'm not saying i'm not \nblaming the other person asking the \nquestion it's just but it's confusing \nfor me \nbecause somehow i'm not i think i \nuh i'm able to understand this in most \ncases you know sometimes i'm very \nconfident and \nabout the question i and and i give you \nthe right answer sometimes i'm confident \nabout the question i give you a \ncompletely answer because i \ni was just too confident about what \nyou're asking me you know and then the \nother person tells me no no michael this \nis not what i meant i said oh yeah sorry \nthis was my first thinking you know i i \nwas thinking too fast you absolutely \nlike if i would have listened more \nclosely to you \nuh yeah now i understand you you ask \nsomething completely different \nso but sometimes at the same time it's i \nthink what you were talking about is \nyeah i can feel i really don't really \nunderstand this question you know and \nthen i i really have to ask you conor \nwell is this what you meant and then you \njust add a little bit more information \nand then i say okay now it's clear to me \nand i think this is \nexactly what you're saying you know just \nif there's a little piece missing and \nthen it would be would become very clear \nand and if this little piece is missing \nit can lead to a completely different \nsituation \nand but i think yeah and i think the \nsame is true for these models you know \nwhen you're saying that it's completely \nthrowing off the model \ni think there you know that's why i'm \nsaying i think if you if you compare \nthis with our human things you can see \nwe humans are not much better actually \nour instincts are not much better or not \nbetter at all \nbut i think the difference is we are \nable to to you know we are \nconsciously we are able to understand \nthis and then we are consciously able to \nyou know counter ask a question and then \nmake it clear and i think this is what \nit seems to me \nyeah kind of missing in the computer \nworld you know that you \ni mean google is trying to do this and i \nthink quite well by saying well did you \nmean this or did you mean that you know \nand and also of course you know \nprofiling us they know when i'm asking \nfor java they know it's not the island \nbecause they know from the history they \nknow most of the time i'm asking for the \ntravel programming language so \nso in this sense uh \ni think they're already doing quite a \ngood job but you're absolutely right and \nbut of course they \nagain if you compare with a human you \nknow we have this conversation it's not \na one-way thing it's it's a \nin going into both directions and i \nthink the same you know \nis true i think for for such computer \nsystems you know \ni think this is why in the end yes it \nwill become a conversation maybe not a \nconversation like we have now but it's \nlike a conversation in order to clarify \nthe question and then once you have \nclarified \nuh you give a great answer so maybe \nthere's a i can give you a very good \nexample that's another use case we are \nworking on again it's a very simple use \ncase it's some of my friends they're \nvery much into cycling \nuh and this is actually a coincidence \nyeah \nthat yeah it's not because of me that i \nlike cycling they they just and they \nthey would like what they would like to \ndo is really like a very simple thing \nyou know you have a problem with your \nbicycle and you would like to find a \nrepair shop which is able to do this \nand you know i don't know how this is in \nthe u.s but you know here in europe it's \noften like this depending on the brand \nuh yeah you can't go to every repair \nshop some of the report shops they will \ntell you \nyou know sorry we don't cover this brand \nyou know you have to go to another \nrepair shop \nso but again you know the thing is like \nthis when i ask a question you know this \nand this is broken where can i repair \nthis \nof course i will tell you there are like \n10 repair shops in your neighborhood but \nnow the thing is like from my experience \ni know \ndepending on your brand you know \ni have to you know make a \nnarrow more narrow selection so i will \nask oh yeah about conor i understand \nyour question but you know what brand do \nyou have do you have a scot bicycle or \ndo you have a track or do you have i \ndon't know whatever you know and \ndepending on and then you say yeah yeah \ni have a scott you know and and then \nokay then then i think it's best you go \nto this repair shop so so you know it's \ni think this is this kind of \nconversation what i'm talking about you \nknow and i think this is uh \nand i think so it's not necessarily the \nthe problem of the model \ni think it's more \nuh because i think my model is not \nnecessarily better you know my human \nmodel is not necessarily better than the \ncomputer model but it's more like the \nthe the the clear the \nhow do you see the clearness of the \nquestion you know the the understanding \nand i think this is why i'm saying \nit's not necessarily important i think \nto \nof course the better the model is \ngreat you know \nthe better the better but i think it's \nnot necessarily again i think it will \nnot necessarily solve the problem in the \nend i think it's more like this \ncombination that you are able to clarify \nthe questions you know that you have \nthis conversation and i think this is \nwhy we humans are very good at you know \nbecause we can \nwe have this ability \nto clarify out of the fuzziness you know \nto clarify the things and of course this \ncannot just be by asking questions you \ncan also by looking at you you know by \nyou know depending what phase you make \nyou know depending the temperature \nyou know depending whether you have the \nweather conditions you know if you ask \nme for an umbrella for example if you \nask me for an umbrella \nif i see \nyou at the beach you know this beautiful \nweather i know well you're not asking \nfor a random brother you're asking for \nan umbrella \nfor the sun you know \nand i i guess that's why i mean you know \nyou yeah i think so i think it's not \njust the model \nit's really \nyeah this ability to clarify \nwhat you're looking for actually yeah i \nlove that example of the beach beach \nversus say being in seattle for what is \numbrella that that's such a great \nexample of disambiguation but so i think \nthis is a great transition into this \ntopic of \nmultimodal embeddings and how that can \nhelp you add context so in the example \nof looking for the bicycle repair shop \nit might be easier to have a tabular \ndescription of bike models rather than \nputting it into natural language because \nif you set up the tabular schema for \ndescribing the bike and then you hit the \ndatabase of the tabular schema \nit seems more natural and maybe you want \nto have a neural representation of \ntabular data as well but and then like \nanother example would be \nsay you go on something like instagram \nor pinterest and you see a pasta that \nyou really like and you're trying to \nquery your local restaurants to see who \nwho can make this pasta for you in that \ncase again the image is going to be so \nmuch better than trying to have a text \ndescription of the pasta so i think this \nkind of topic of \nmultimodal not just text but \ntext maybe it's even uh in the last \npodcast with multi we talked about uh \ntables for searching through scientific \npapers so \ntables you know and then or compared to \ntabular data that you designed for \ndescribing a bike model and then again \nimages audio the facial expression the \nway you ask the question the tonality in \nthe way you ask the question \nsuch an interesting kind of thing and \nhave you started thinking about like \nintegrating other kinds of data than \ntext in in the kd system uh no not yet \nbecause we're not even there yet with \nthe you know the simple version of yeah \nno but you're absolutely right i think \nthis is uh \nyeah i think in the end uh \nthis is what it's going to evolve to you \nknow that we have these multi-modal \ninputs and \nand uh \nconversations i think and i think you \nknow again i think we humans we do this \nvery \nunconsciously you know we we do these uh \nyou know we we're not even aware that we \nare doing this you know but that \nactually we are doing this all the time \nand we are so good at it that you know \nit's again \ni'm really sorry if i might get off \ntopic again but you know we \ni think humans most of the thing that \nthe consciousness is really just the tip \nof the iceberg you know \nwe we \ni don't know i don't know how much \npercent but let's say 90 of the things \nwe're doing unconsciously and based on \nthese unconscious things we make a lot \nof decisions and \ndo a lot of things we \nand and this is why we are so \nseem to be so intelligent \nso and i think these computers i think \nthis is the same thing you know i think \nwe \nand i think this is why many people \nthink computers are limited you know \nthey will never get like humans but i \nthink this is not really fair you know \nbecause we don't really give the \ncomputers the input which the humans \nhave you know if you just think about \nour senses you know we have the you know \nwe have the temperature we have the \nsense of you know wind or not wind we \nhave uh \nyou know all kind of sensors and this is \nall being fed into us and we give this \nto process and based on this we can do \nsomething with computers we just have \nthe input of the data with the keyboard \nand that's it basically it means it's \nclear that computers can with this \nlittle input you know i mean you can try \nthis on yourself if you only get very \nlimited input you know if you are \nlimiting yourself from a lot of input \nyou you get completely lost \nand and in this sense i think this is \nwhy i think uh \nyeah it's just at the beginning in this \nsense that i think once computers have \nthis you know they can become much more \npowerful \nand again another example i think you \nknow we talk to each other we talk to \nourselves all the time you know i mean \nagain we don't program computers to talk \nto themselves \nyou know again i think if you would \nprogram a computer to talk to oneself \nthat computer could talk communicate \nwith itself you know \nthis might would change a lot actually \nand so i think in this sense i think \nit's a little unfair actually how we \ntreat computer systems you know and \nat the same time you know i know many \npeople are quite afraid of this you know \ni'm not really afraid of this i i think \nyeah it's just a natural uh \nbut no i i we completely wish you this \nmulti uh \nthis multimodal thing i think this is \nand i think this year i think if evie is \ndoing this and uh \ni think that's really great i think so \nand yeah with katie i have to say at the \nmoment we are focusing more on the \nuh one step after the other you know we \nare already very happy if you just can't \ngive uh you know with somebody's asking \na question and we can give the best \npossible answer you know and \nand i think then the next we just \ngo one step \nafter the other \nand i think yeah vvh can help us with \nthis and i think that's really great and \nif we can help deviate the other way \naround you know that we can share our \nexperience which we are making we turn \nthis to viviate \nyou know i think we're very happy to \nshare this and i hope viviate will \nsucceed better with our you know our \nexperience our observations basically \nyeah and we've eat has recently added \nthe clip image tech support which is \nkind of like the first step i think \naligning images and text will be the \nfirst probably step to combining all \nthese different modalities but i think \nyou're painting a really interesting \nkind of future for ai we have things \nlike the perceiver i o architecture that \ncan take in any kind of input data and \nhave this kind of latent uh latent array \nthat it attends to to form \nrepresentation and integrate all sorts \nof data and then i think another really \ninteresting part of this is the role of \nlanguage in this and to me it started \nwith the text-to-text transfer \ntransformer the t5 model where they \nshowed how you could unify all these \nsupervised learning tasks through the \nlanguage modeling task so you just say \nuh you just prepend it will say natural \nlanguage inference give it the two \nthings sentiment classification question \nanswering like you just describe the \ntask as natural language and it makes \nsense and it works and i and then um so \neric jang recently wrote an article \ntitled just ask for generalization that \nreally describes how \nthe way that i understand generalization \nis there's kind of like two modes to it \nthere's robustness and corruption \ntesting where you rotate an image add \nsome noise and all of a sudden it thinks \nthe panda's a dog and who knows why that \nhappens and that's a huge problem and \nthen the other side of generalization is \ncompositional generalization where what \nmakes us so excited about things like \nopen ai's dolly \nis that it's able to combine the concept \nof avocado and armchair and avocado \narmchair and create that and create that \nkind of image so the compositionality \nand language is the interface for \ncompositionality as uh eric jang \ndescribes really well in the in the \narticle just asked for generalization so \nthe idea of perceiver i o combining all \nsorts of different kind of \ntypes of data senses and then the \nlanguage interface for uh querying for \neach for like accessing that \ncompositionality of the multimodal data \nand then yeah that idea of self play and \nmaybe reinforcement learning has a piece \nto play in this as well but overall i \nthink this paints a really exciting \npicture of kind of where ai is headed no \ni i agree no i think it's it's it's very \nexciting \ni have to say and i wish i have i wish i \ni would have started earlier with these \nthings because i'm still i still have to \nlearn so much you know and it feels to \nme like you know when i \nstarted physics you know i remember you \nknow i or when i did basic research you \nknow ai existed at this time but it was \nvery \nyou know the neural networks \nit was not so advanced you know and i \nthink really over the last couple of \nyears and i i have to say admit you know \ni was like sleeping not a sleeping \nbeauty but i was kind of sleeping you \nknow and these things passed \nbeside me and then later i realized oh \nwow so many things happened and i really \nuh i i \nand i'm slowly i'm catching up \nand uh \nyeah but at the same time i see uh still \nhuge \nyou know huge opportunities still you \nknow and i think we are far from uh \nyeah i think we \nand at the same time i see the \nlimitations of humans you know as i said \nyou know my \nfor example uh \nyou know my wife she's originally from \nbrazil and you know and she's \nwhen i see how she has to learn german \nand i have to see how i learn portuguese \nyou know it's it's crazy you know how we \nhumans have difficulty to learn another \nlanguage whereas you know if i see \npeople or google translate you know how \nwell they do the translations just based \non feeding data into it you know and i i \nwish me as a human i would be like this \nyou know i wish somebody could plug in \nthe portuguese language into my into \nmyself and i could just speak portuguese \nyou know and for me to just you know \njust learn \nsimple words i take so much time i take \na couple of days just to remember them \nyou know and but then at the same time \nit's it's crazy you know then once i \nhave some words suddenly i can make \ncombinations you know and \nand out of nowhere i i don't know why \nyou know it's just happening and it's \nit's really fascinating so \nno so i think it's i i agree completely \ni think it's it's really fascinating \nbut yeah i have to meet myself i i'm not \na \ni'm not an expert in many things i just \nhave to still \ncatch up and learn and \nuh yeah and i hope he can contribute and \ni hope he can contribute back also to \nviviate as i said because i i really \nappreciate what vv8 is doing that \nthey're doing this open source you know \nand making things available because i \nreally think again i think this is \nsomething important i think uh \nyou know with the bigger companies i \nmean they have great knowledge i mean \nyou can see i mean google is \nyeah definitely the benchmark on i mean \nother companies too and \ni think you know without becoming too \npolitical but i think these things these \ntechnologies i think it's important that \nnot just a few companies or not just a \nfew \norganizations have these i think it's \nimportant that this everyone is able to \naccess this you know i think it's a \nlittle bit like the \nhaving some human rights you know like \nable to vote you know on a political \nsystem and i think with artificial \nintelligence i think it's the same that \nyou really have this knowledge you know \nand that this knowledge is being shared \nuh \namong everyone you know and of course i \nunderstand from a company point of view \nyou would you would like to have an \nadvantage you know \nin order to earn money i mean for \neveryone but i think these i think this \nis why i think i appreciate very much \nwhat v8 is doing that they share this \nknowledge you know and really try to \nadvance this knowledge i think this is \nreally great yeah and i and i really \nlike uh companies like mosaic ml that's \nbuilding systems around efficient \ntraining of deep learning and i think \nthe big thing that's preventing it from \nbeing more democratic and everyone \nhaving access to it is the size of the \nmodels if if you need to have 100 \nbillion parameters or you know \nessentially like a million dollar \nmachine to do this then that's going to \nbe a huge problem and i recently made a \nvideo on a title general purpose readers \nwhere i think this idea that we've eat \nis doing haystack these uh neural search \nengines of decomposing the task into \nretrieve then read components \nyou'll probably be able to you probably \nwon't need as much parametric complexity \nin the reader now \nbecause it doesn't need to store the \ndata in the parameters so i think this \nthis kind of idea of separating out the \nreader and then and then branding the \nreader as the general purpose kind of ai \napi that can reason over any kind of \nembedding space what as it generalizes \nto you know images text and all that \nkind of stuff or like even like if we \nthink about robotics and how \nall the senses regarding that and so i \nreally think that kind of idea of a \nreader api will be helped democratize \nthe kind of technology but so i think \nwe've covered so many uh research topics \nin our podcast and and i'd love to have \nyou on again later on as to keep this \nconversation going but as we kind of \nwrap this up could you tell me a little \nmore about uh the future for katie and \nkind of what's on your road map that \nyou're trying to build right now yeah \nsure but maybe if you don't mind just \none remark you just said about what you \njust said about you know these uh \ndemocratizing and about the large big \nmodels i think they're again i'm not an \nexpert in this but you know again if i \njust compare with nature you know our \nbrain doesn't need so much energy and \nit's quite small and it's capable of \nyou know great things so there my hope \nstill is of course that you know \ni think the thing is like at the moment \nit feels to me like a little bit like we \nare doing 20s ai we're trying to do this \non computers with uh \nyou know it's like \nuh how's that let's say this but you \nknow it's like you use a tractor for \nagriculture \nto i don't know to \nto to go drive 10 000 kilometers of \ncourse it will take you a long time you \nknow \nand \nit seems to me i think i could imagine \nthat uh \nyou know that that the the info the the \nhardware that these will all you know if \nyou are able to change the hardware you \nknow like processes or whatever and you \nknow that they are more optimized for ai \nthat this will also change things you \nknow and make things more democratic and \nit seems to me that as far as i know \ngoogle is working on this that they have \nspecialized ai \nwhatever \nprocesses \nand i could as i said i'm not an expert \nin this but i could imagine you know \nthat we are currently trying to do \nthings on infrastructure and hardware \nwhich is not really made for these kind \nof things and if he actually \nyou know if he changed this then this \ncould really suddenly change everything \nas well you know suddenly the things \nwe're trying to do becomes accessible \nfor everyone very easily \nand \njust yeah to \njust to have this but coming back to \nyour question about uh the road map yeah \nso the world map at the moment is really \ni think \nme personally i really would love to \nhave haiti \nthat we can just use it you know inside \nyou know \npublic mailing this uh public flag \nchannels you know and really just try to \nmake an improvement there you know that \nuh \nthat katie you know just could be like a \nsuperhuman you know \nunderstanding these questions you know \ngiving great answers \nand just making life easier for people \nin these areas because as i said you \nknow i think it's a little bit sad \nthat i mean i know this from many \nprobably middle east you know that uh \nyou know people many people \npsychologically they don't \nthey they are afraid to ask questions \nbecause they might look stupid you know \nthey \nthey they rather spend hours \nyou know searching you know googling or \nwhatever \nuh \nand not finding the right answer but \njust asking a simple question you know \nwhich somebody who has this knowledge \ncould answer and \nand i think this would really be great \nuh if he could solve or improve this \nproblem i think this would really be \ngreat i think that \nthat's one thing on the world map and \nthe other thing is really to make sense \nof conversations you know i mean you \nhave \nyou have a lot of conversations going on \nbut you know of course humans are lazy \nthey don't want to document you know the \nthe key findings you know i remember we \nhad on uh \nyou know like \n15 years ago i was part of this cocoon \nit's cocoon is an apache software \nfoundation project which doesn't isn't \nreally very active anymore but you know \nat the same time i remember \npeople were asking questions and then \neventually \nthere was a good answer you know and \nthen always people said you know let's \nlet's take this answer with summary or \ngood answer so that people know this is \nreally the answer they don't have to \nread like a thread of 100 emails to get \nto the right answer \nand again you know of course nobody was \ndoing this maybe \nsome discipline people they said okay \nthis is the summary is a good answer \nsome some people maybe even documented \nthis in the wiki or somewhere but let's \nbe honest you know humans are quite lazy \nthey \nyou can tell them as much as as you want \nthey don't do this and they're not bad \npeople but they're just lazy and i think \nif katie could \nget sense out of these big conversations \nand create summaries and then you know \nprovide this again as good answers i \nmean this would be a huge help and you \nknow i mean you know again if you \ncompletely \ncompare it with the \nnot computer world you know it's like \nphysical cleaning if i have a vacuum \ncleaner \nyou know \nvacuum cleaner is a great invention you \nknow i don't have to do everything by \nhand you know i just clean it you know \nwith the vacuum cleaner goes much faster \nso and if i it again this is something i \nthink that we really make sense out of \nthese conversations which are happening \nin public mailing lists or public \nchannels uh this would be great and then \nof course for us earning money you know \ni mean \nyeah i think yeah somehow somewhere we \nhave to pay the salary \nand if we can sell these technologies to \nthe companies you know which have \ninternally the same problems you know \nbecause \nif you have bigger corporations you know \nthey have also the same thing you know \nthey have uh people talking to each \nother and you know uh \nthere we can apply the same technology \nand if they pay us for this you know \nthat they can use our software for this \nthen the better you know \nand uh \nyeah so that's basically on the roadmap \nto just uh improve these things and in \nthe end make life easier you know that \nyou can spend \nyour time on other things basically and \nyeah \nuh you know again it's uh \nif you uh another comparison is you know \nhere i don't know about the us but i \nguess it's similar in the s but here in \nswitzerland if you go to the shop you \nknow you can do the self checkout \nyou know of course people were very \nafraid that the people that people \ncounting the things you know and \nthat they lose their jobs but i don't \nthink this happened actually you know \nthey just \nare able to do other things you know and \nand i can do the self-checkout it's much \nfaster and and it's really great and \nyou know and i think it's \ni think it's rather that you pay these \npeople you know i mean and the reason \nthat people do these jobs because they \ndon't have such a good education and i \nthink we rather spend the money on \ngiving people a better education and \nthey can do something which is more \nmeaningful and well meaningful in the \nsense like you know \nuh \nyeah not not something which machines \ncould do and i think \ni think the same is with haiti you know \nif he can do \nimprove these things and people then can \nspend their time on other things i think \ngreat i think \nand yeah unless they want to do these \nthings then they can still do this of \ncourse i'm not \nso don't get me wrong it's not it's not \nabout replacing people it's really just \nsupporting people and making life easier \nso \nand i think \nmy life becomes easier you know if i \ndon't have to search two hours for \nsomething \nand i just take two minutes to find the \nright thing i mean great i think yeah \ni can go to the forest you know and and \nwalk there and \nyeah i think it i think it's such a like \na noble mission statement and this \nproblem you're solving is so important \nand i you know you've communicated it \nvery clearly i think everyone would \nagree with the importance of this one \nquestion i had and i i hope this isn't \nlike giving away the trade secret of it \nbut how easy is it to get the data from \nslack into your database is the slack \noffer an easy api to just take your \nslack conversations and just have it as \na \njson file or whatever yeah it's like \nit's actually i have to admit was to say \nuh uh all credits to slack is actually \nvery easy you know it's it's also \nuh \nthe if you you can't dislike you you \njust ask for the permissions you know \nand that you get the content you know \nand then basically \nwe just read everything and we just try \nto detect questions you know and again \nyou can do this in a \nmore less sophisticated or more \nsophisticated way you know the the less \nsophisticated way that the least \nsophisticated way is you just look for a \nquestion mark \nthen a little bit more sophisticated you \nyou look for words like who where when \nwhy these kind of things in the \ncombination and of course the more \nsophisticated way again you you send the \ndata through some neural network which \nis doing some classification of the you \nknow the communication and then we'll \nsay ah this is a question for example \nthis is like a question about \ni don't know something about these about \nsomething about these like these no \nslack is really good about these they \nare really good ms teams they're a \nlittle bit more restrictive \nthere you only get the content at least \ni talked to microsoft \nand they said you only get the content \nif you directly you know if you say hey \nkatie you know and then \nyou really have to address it to katie \nto that katie is getting the content \notherwise you can't read the whole \ncommunication which i think is a little \nyeah it i think it would be nice if you \ncould read the whole communication \nuh \nthen the other thing metrics i don't \nknow if you know metrics metric is like \nan open source uh chat uh it's more like \nemail you know federated uh \nmatrix is really great too but with \nmetrics you have to pull the content but \nof course this you can do \nand this email is the same you know you \njust pull the content basically you know \nyou you you just \nwhat katie is doing you know it's \nbasically \nuh you know just subscribing basically \nto to imap you know and just pulling the \ncontent and then analyzing it and \nwriting it back you know just like what \nyou do as a human you know basically \nuh so it's the same \nso uh \nno actually this is quite easy but yes \nyou have depending on the channel you \nhave to do this differently for each \nchannel so that's a little bit \nit would be nice if this would be a \nlittle bit more standardized but it's \nit's okay and no i have to say it's like \nit's really good it's it's probably the \nopposite you know \nthat people are sometimes afraid that \nkatie is learning too much you know from \nthese things and people are little but \nyou know it's funny again it's very \npsychological because you as a human are \nreading these too you know what i mean \nis like if you are in a \nin the vva channel you you will read \nthese messages too you know so why \nshouldn't katie read these messages you \nknow \nuh i think there's still this uh \nfear that \nthat that computers are doing something \nbad with this information you know \nwhereas humans could do just the same \nyou know \nuh and and this is actually quite \ninteresting that that \nbut yeah of course and uh \nbut i think this is more like a topic \nfor you know uh \nyeah privacy you know the privacy issues \nthat you just follow certain privacy \nissues just as you require from humans \ntoo you know it's like when you are \nsaying \nthat uh \nyou know if you work in the company and \nyou have to sign a confident confidence \nconfidence conf \nagreement for being confidential you \nknow and uh i mean and of course you \nhave to do the same thing with the \ncomputer that you know that you make \nsure this data is well protected and \nit's not being misused and \nand i think as \nthen of course but there i have to admit \nyou know once \nyou know if i could hack your brain you \ncould i could only get your information \nof course with a computer that's a \nlittle bit more difficult if you are in \na company with let's say \nyou know like for example one thing is \nabout the private bank which might has 2 \n000 employees you know and the computer \nis collecting all the data from these 2 \n000 employees and somebody is able to \nhack into this you have the information \nof all of them you know whereas if i \njust can get connect with you i only \nhave your information i don't have the \ninformation of the 1999 \npeople otherwise i mean this is \nto be fair that's the difference you \nknow these computers you you are able \ndepending \nyou're able to get much more information \nthan just from one person you know \nand and i think this is something we \nhave to be yeah careful with and \nand i have to me but this is again what \nwe do with katie we really have this \nyou know we have every knowledge base \nit's \ncompletely separated you know we don't \nshare the data between the knowledge \nbases you know it's not it's not like \none big brain but basically \nevery knowledge base is dedicated uh \ndata container basically so because we \nwant to make sure that you know if \nsomebody says no let's delete this data \nyou hit the button and it's deleted you \nknow instantly basically and you don't \nhave to see oh how was this connected \nwith these intensities yeah \nso this is something we really try to \ntake good care of yeah but of course \nmistakes can happen and yeah i'd love to \nsee like um similar to how we all trust \nsay the stripe api with payments i'd \nlove to see some kind of federated \nlearning company emerge where \nyou you go to a \nproduct like katie and you see it's like \nthe data is managed with \ncompany name and it's like a data \nprivacy for deep learning kind of api \nthat we all trust i'd love to see that \nkind of thing exist to solve this kind \nof problem no i think it's a i agree \nwith you that you know that is really uh \nit's a challenge and i think it's uh i \nthink you have to define this as a \nrequirement you know as a strict \nrequirement if you don't define this as \na strict requirement people will start \nto \nnot do this so well you know not so \nproperly and in the end it's not because \nthey're evil it's just because they \ndon't think about this you know and i \nthink \nyou have to be very clear about this and \nyeah i think this changed very much and \ni have to say you know maybe in \nswitzerland this is a little bit more uh \nobvious i don't know i don't know i'm \njust saying in switzerland because you \nknow there's uh the banks are very much \nabout privacy the banks and the \ninsurance companies they are very about \nprivacy \nand so they are really forcing you to do \nthese you know and and even sometimes it \nsounds a little silly how they you know \nbecause they are \nuh but but it's in this sense it's a \ngood thing because they're really \nforcing you to think about this and uh \nand uh yeah i think generally it's very \nimportant uh also again i think privacy \nis a very important thing also on the \nlevel of humans you know it's i think \ndoesn't matter yeah \ni i know it can be also have the \nopposite side you know but i think still \ni think it's an important very important \nthing and i think you have to have this \nas a requirement from the very beginning \nso yeah so that \nto ask kind of more of a personal \nquestion about the development of this \nthing obviously katie this mission is \nvery big this this kind of thing you \nknow if it's built it could be so \nvaluable what's kind of like your um \nday-to-day like the level of how much \nwork is going into developing this kind \nof a thing and the organization of katy \ni'd imagine scaling it up to building a \nwhole company around this and what's \nyour thinking about all that kind of \nstuff of uh you know really bringing \nbecause it's such a powerful vision i \nsee it as \nrequiring almost maybe like a herculean \neffort \ni mean a lot of these things like you \nknow alleviate and uh other tools help \nfacilitate it but how much how hard is \nthis to really bring this to life well i \nthink at the moment \nwe are quite lucky actually we have uh \nthe seed funding we received \nthe investors are very very nice people \nin this sense \nand uh they're not like you know they're \nnot pushing us to \nlet's say you know to make a profit \nyou know very soon \nin this sense i think i think what is \nmost important at the moment for us is \njust to show \nthat this could really work you know \nthat this really \nmakes sense you know and it could really \nwork we are able to pull this off \nand \nthat yeah \nit it it does create an improvement and \nthen that people start to see the \npotential you know i think this is the \nmost important and \nbut i have to say at the moment we are \nstill uh i wish we could spend more time \non the fundamentals you know like these \nfor example this concept of \nunderstanding that we \nuh \nyeah to develop this concept of \nunderstanding of a question and then \nbasically out of this on this concept of \nunderstanding making a query and this \nconscious process of you know making a \nselection of these different algorithms \nthis is something i hope we will be able \nto spend more time soon at the moment we \nare still spending a lot of time on the \nthe more the the regular things actually \nlike you know what you were asking how \nto connect to channels like slack and \nyou know because the thing is \nuh honestly you know in order to to make \nthis uh that it work we need the data we \nneed that people start interacting with \nit you know also this is why i i really \nappreciate very much viviate that they \nallow us \nto use the vva channel the review \nchannel i think is a great use case \nbecause they are like 300 or more \nmembers and people ask a lot of \nquestions you know and it's really such \na great use case to test it \nand and i think this is very important \nfor us so but i think now we are getting \nreally close to this \nthat we have the the the fundamentals to \nto do these things to get the \ninformation and to answer that really \npeople start interacting with it i know \nthis sounds a little silly but it it's \nquite a lot of work actually it sounds \nvery easy from the outside but there's \nso many details \nand then also like for example with this \ninsurance company they're really also \nthey're really doing this too and \nthey're very uh enthusiastic about it \nand uh \nbut at the same time you know we also \nhad some \nuh \nsetbacks you say this and you know that \nfor example we had one company they also \nused they also used like very much you \nknow and we were we had great hopes \nactually but we had to find out that you \nknow they only use slags for social \ninteraction you know they only use like \nin the sense like hey when do we go for \nlunch hey \nwhen when does this person has birthday \nuh you know who who restarted the server \nyou know it's it's a lot of questions \nwhich katie can't answer because you \nknow i mean i can't katie can't answer \nwhen we should go for lunch you know \nso \nso uh so i we had to realize you know \ndepending on the situation you know \nthese convocation can't scan channels \nthey don't they're not being used for uh \nknowledge with which katie can make any \nsense of basically you know \nand but this was a very important lesson \nlesson to learn so for example what we \nlearned there is \na very important lesson we learned was \nthat yeah really we have to analyze the \ncommunication we have to be able to \nanalyze the communication and then see \ndoes this communication actually make \nsense you know in the sense like for \nkatie you know does it actually is it \nactually uh \nyou know again you know like if you have \nuh \nyou know \nif you have a road bicycle you know but \nyou live in the mountains without any \nvotes \nyou know you can have a fantastic road \nbicycle but it doesn't make sense it \njust doesn't make sense because in the \nmountains there are no streets and it so \nyou need a different tool you know to do \nthis so and this again it sounds silly \nbut this was an important lesson to \nlearn then the other important lesson to \nlearn was \nthat we have these uh three phases of \ndeploying katy in the sense like you \nknow i mean you know this probably from \nsiri you know many i mean i know i think \nsiri and alexa are great you know but \nsometimes you can observe this many \npeople they they play with you but they \nsay at some point uh well you know yeah \ni can i can use it for this and that but \nfor all the other things i can't use it \nand they get frustrated and they don't \nreally start use siri anymore \nso what we learned is it's really \nimportant not to frustrate people so \nwhat we did is we have three phases of \nkatie so when we deploy katy the first \nthing is just to analyze you know we \nkatie is reading and analyzing the \nthings but you don't really see katie \nyou know it's just there listening you \nknow it's just like an employee you put \ninto a company and the employee doesn't \nknow much \nand you don't you know you just tell \njust observe and listen you know just \nlook and try to learn as much as \npossible \nthis is the first phase and the second \nphase is basically to have a motivated \nemployee a moderated kd so basically you \nsay okay now i think you learned enough \nand now you should be \nbe to actually you should be ready to \nparticipate you know but in order not to \nnot make people angry \nuh you don't directly answer but show me \nyour answers first basically and you \nknow and then \nthe humans can basically moderate katie \nso if katie uh is providing a good \nanswer then they say okay yes this is a \ngood answer just put send it you know \nbut if it's not good you have to correct \nit basically \nand once you get to the level that you \ncan see okay kd is really answering in a \ngood way like let's say 95 of the \nquestions are good or 85 then you \nbasically let katie lose you know and \nyou just then katie is there you know so \nand i think these three phases are very \nimportant \nand uh because otherwise you know you \nfrustrate people because they people \nthink okay first of first they think oh \nkg doesn't know anything \nsecond they all \nsee always or he whatever he doesn't \nprovide the right answers you know and \nand so they just say oh please turn it \noff it's annoying you know so so i think \nit's very important \nfrom a human point of view that \nkatie you you only see katie at this \ntime when it really is good enough \nbasically and this was also a very \nimportant lessons we had to learn and \nand that's why i'm saying you know \ni wish we could yeah well this took i \nknow now it sounds like okay why didn't \nyou know this in the first place but it \nwas really things we had to experience \nand and it took us some time to learn \nthese things and built into katy \nbasically so \nand but and i think now we are very \nclose to actually really spend more time \non these fundamental algorithms you know \nlike what i said about the concept of \nunderstanding and you know then using \ndifferent algorithms and combining them \nand getting the most out of it and this \nis this is going to be the next big step \nand \nand i think then i think then i hope we \nreally have this we can prove \nand then i hope basically we can go to \nthe next round of financing or whatever \nbut yeah it's going to be a critical \npoint of view i tell you honestly if \nyou're not able to prove this yeah it's \nuh \nyeah we i don't know how to continue but \nso far we have nice investors and they \ntrust us and i hope we can prove this \nand i'm i'm very confident i'm very \noptimistic you know that we can do this \nuh \ni think we just have to continue yeah \nit's so awesome it's such an exciting \nvision and so interesting for me to i \nlearned so much from this conversation \nand thank you so much for having it and \nthank you so much for coming on the wva \npodcast really hope to see you again and \nuh check in in a little bit to see you \nknow how this is all coming together so \nmany uh moving parts things in \ndevelopment that are so exciting and the \nvision is so captivating of the kd this \nquestion answering system in slack \nchannels and maybe a good place to uh \ndemo it out and illustrate it would be \nwith our we v8 slack channel which is \nreally the original inspiration for this \npodcast between uh eddie and anaya's uh \ntrying to address questions from the we \nva chat in a podcast form so maybe that \nwould be a fun thing for you to \nfor us to kind of integrate telling the \nstory of how this is coming together \nwell thank you very much thomas i really \nappreciate the opportunity to \ntell about katie and how this works \ntogether with bb8 and i really again i \nwould like to thank you very much vivian \nfor giving us the opportunity and to use \nit you know i think he's really \nfantastic \nand i really hope that we can uh yeah \nthat \nwe can really learn as much as possible \nfrom each other and share this \ninformation and you know improve \nboth of us you know and \nyeah and i i yeah it's just i think it's \nreally great thank you very much
