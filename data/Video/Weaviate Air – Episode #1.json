{"text": " \nforeign \n[Music] \n[Music] \npodcast where we are it's me Sebastian \nwe are a good Etienne Connor and Erica \nfrom uv8 we all like hailing from our \nhomes or offices wherever we are and by \nthe way this podcast is 100 live so I \nwould encourage you to say hi on on \nYouTube uh questions or on on the chat \nif you have questions fire them up and \nwe'll try to answer them as we go and we \nare super excited to meet you all \num so we have like a packet packed \nagenda we want to talk about many \ndifferent topics what's new in the \nresearch we want to show you some demo \nproject talk about our roadmap and \nthere's so many cool things that we \nwould like to share and again like I \nmentioned ask questions as we go and if \nyou have any feedback or ideas in the \nfuture or you feel like maybe you should \nfeature in one of the sessions give us a \nshout and we can for sure get that \narranged so the first thing I want to do \nis talk about our roadmap and so many of \nyou probably didn't know but we \npublished that recently on our vv8 \nwebsite and I'm going to share our \nscreen and basically this is where we \ntalk we highlight like some of the \nfeatures that we'll be working on for \nversion 116 for 117 we have some uh also \nideas in the backlog and actually it's \npretty cool because you can go and up \nvote for those items \num and so you could definitely a stay \nvery informed by what checking out that \npage but but also you could contribute \ninto uh into how we prioritize each of \nthose items so in case you don't know \nhow to find it just go to uh developers \ninto our documentation and then on the \nnavigation it's just under roadmap and \nthen we could just the future world map \nso I'm going to take this opportunity \nthat we have at the end our CTO to \nactually walk over some of the items \nthat we have in the roadmap and um at \nthe end can you tell us what all those \nitems are \nyeah sure absolutely hi everyone so yeah \nas Sebastian just said with the roadmap \nwe really want to be a bit more \ntransparent so you may have seen that \nwe've we've been publishing these blog \nposts whenever we have a release but of \ncourse until we get to the point to to \nhave such release ready a lot of \nplanning goes into it and part of that \nplanning is basically prioritizing what \nfeatures do we want and this is a matter \nof who uh had some ideas from the \ncommunity what does the community really \nneed uh what the semi as a business need \nwhat do we need for for offering our vvn \ncloud service offering so it's balancing \nall these these needs and we want to be \na bit more more open about it a bit more \ntransparent about and that is exactly \nwhat that roadmap is for so on the \nroadmap we're trying to to look at the \nnext two or so releases and that that of \ncourse that's always super Dynamic so \nyou can see uh current release is \n1.15.2 and then uh the next sort of the \nnext minor releases are the ones that we \nreally care about like of course there \nmay be patch releases in between because \nwe fixed something but the minor \nreleases is what we what we really plan \nfor and 1.16 is next you can see an ETA \nhere so it's put on on week 44 which I \nthink is the the first week of November \nso it's about four weeks from from now \nwhich I can actually say because this is \nlive so \num and then we also have 1.17 which \nwould be the one after that which would \nbe to towards the end of the year and \nthen as it goes with road maps so so um \nthe further you move in time serve the \nmore the less uh likely it is to stay \nthe way or the more likely it is that \nsomething might change and then of \ncourse we also have the backlog which \nare basically uh feature requests or \nideas that either we agreed that we want \nto tackle them but we have not \nprioritized them yet so you can you \ncould upload for them or it could be \num that maybe something is currently in \nresearch that we're looking at something \nand and um yeah we we say like okay this \nis something that we want to do but we \ndon't want to do it right now because we \nwant to find out how do you as users use \nit how do we build it from a technical \nperspective how do we make sure that it \nhas a super great ux because you know \nBBA is all about the user experience so \nwe want to get that right which could \nsometimes mean that we put something a \nbit later on the roadmap um to to make \nsure that we get it right so that's uh \nfor the roadmap itself but let's also \ntalk about the contents so as I just \nsaid four weeks from now is when we're \ngoing to have 1.16 out that's of course \nan estimated time of arrival so could \nchange a bit but I think we're on a good \nuh schedule for for this one so let me \ndive into the contents um this one \nproposal so so this you see here we we \nhave the GitHub issues linked so you \ncould actually open them up like if I \nopen them up I'm not sure I think that \nwould uh not showing the screen sharing \nhere um but doesn't matter like if you \nif you click on one of those you see the \nGitHub issues behind them so this one's \nlabeled as a proposal and this one is \nsomething that uh was so it was \nintroduced before we had this upload \nfeature um but we know from talking to \nall of you that this is one of the most \nrequested features that you uh out there \nhave which is dealing with null values \nin VBA so this means searching for \nfields that are not set or doing some \nkind of filters where you uh um assert \nthat a certain field is set or is not \nset and then do kind of kind of specific \nbehavior with it this also goes for \nimproving the ux around null value so in \nprevious releases there was a difference \nin setting an explicit or setting a \nfield explicitly to a null as opposed to \nnot setting it sort of tying this all up \nand really making making uh null values \nor unset values not just an edge case \nbut an actual sort of feature case that \nwe think about and dealing with it and \nthere will be a new operator to to \num yeah search for for whether a field \nis set or not and we got a ton of input \nfrom all of you out there and that's \nsuper great please please keep doing \nthat and if you want um you can of \ncourse still uh give us feedback but we \nreally love these like uh early feedback \nCycles even before something is built \ninvolving all of you not just for what \nyou care about but also for for \nbasically yeah how do we have to build \nit to give you the best possible ux for \nthat feature next one is another one \nthat's that's super popular in the \ncommunity which is the idea of \ncross-referencing centroids so this is a \nmodule and if you know vba's module \nsystem and we have different types of \nmodules you can actually see that in the \nin the navigation \num or you could if I I \num \nif I uh expand it we have retrievers and \nvectorizers readers and generates Etc \nand this is basically a vectorizer \nmodule so the idea is that you already \nknow the text to VEC modules and in \nthose you would have text input and uh \nthe module at input time or at update \ntime would basically take the object put \nit into the model and you get a vector \nout and then that Vector would be \ncreated at at or would be indexed while \nyou import this object with Crest cross \nreference centroids I think that the \nmodule is called reftubec you can do \nthat automatically but not based on the \ncontents of the actual object but based \non the length of that outgoing or the \noutgoing links off that object so for \nexample if you have a let's say two \nclasses a class book and a class \nchapters and then your chapters class \nwould have individual vectors for each \nchapters then you could just summarize \nbasically the book by yeah summarize all \nthe chapters in a book class by having a \nobject of type book with outgoing \nreferences to to those chapters or \nanother use case would be for example a \nshopping cart where you have items in \nyour shopping cart and then by creating \nthose references and sort of inheriting \nin a sense uh the the mean Vector of \nthese individual objects in your card \nyou could now index dropping cards so \nyou could do stuff like similarity \nsearch for related for related or for \nsimilar shopping carts which is super \ncool for e-commerce use cases for \nexample so lots of great new \nopportunities there and of course it \nfits very well into vba's module system \ninto the existing API so that's that's \nreally cool then making I I want to \ninterrupt just for a second so yeah on \nthe cross reference centroids by the way \num this is actually a research that \ncorner is working on so if this is a \ntopic that you find interesting and \nexciting first of all go and upvoted on \non GitHub just uh just like at the end \nwas showing you that you can find the \nlinks there but yeah of pingers on on a \npublic slug or pink corner and then \nlet's start a conversation especially if \nyou have opinions ideas or uh yeah \nConnor is very knowledgeable about it \nand we're still thinking of all sort of \ninteresting ideas on how to do the \ncentroids \num so for sure um let us know but yeah \nat the end you can continue thank you \num yeah exactly and then if you have \nquestions we have Connor here and look \nat that call as well so that's a great \nopportunity just put them in the chat \nand then um Conor can can respond a next \none is a completely different direction \nso you can see with every release we're \nreally trying to balance \num the needs of the different \nstakeholders for vb8 release which means \nthere's something feature driven there's \nsomething more operations driven this is \non the operation side so the node's \nendpoint is a simple API to uh tell you \nthe status of the nodes in a cluster so \nthese are the notes like if you deployed \non on kubernetes for example the nodes \nor the pods \num if you do it agnostic of something \nlike kubernetes it's just the individual \ndeviate notes so basically Management in \nthat cluster and this is a prerequisite \nfor what we're going to do in 1.17 which \nis going to be super cool as well but \nalso just to get some insights into like \nis your cluster healthy but then in the \nfuture also to to adapt it so right now \nit's a read-only API but in the future \nyou could use this to to make changes \nfor example let's say you want to take \ndown a note for Nim for maintenance so \nyou could drain the node off workloads \nand these kind of things so that's \nthat's more an operations uh driven side \num yeah which we which we want to \nintroduce in 1.16 as well \nthen the next one is multi-note support \nfor backup so in 1.15 the previous \nrelease \num we wrote a a long a blog post about \nit we introduced backups which I believe \nis still one of the coolest features \nthat we've ever built just because it's \nit's so ux focused and it's so flexible \nand you can use backups to uh store a \nrestore backup to and restore from \ndifferent Cloud providers you could use \nthat to to use a production instance \ntake a snapshot of that production \ninstance and and maybe run it on your \nlocal machine so it's super super \nflexible feature and there was one \nlimitation that we did to to release \nthis a bit sooner and that was in 1.15 \nthat it was limited to a single note \nviviate instance and that limitation is \ngoing to be lifted with 1.16 it will \nwork on a multi-node cluster and this is \nnot just great for for all of you who \ncan use it in a cluster node but this is \nalso super cool for for us basically \nbecause it's a building block for what \nwe're going to do in 1.17 so all this \nkind of multi-node coordination that \nwe're building here you're going to hear \nthat again because we're doing lots and \nlots more multi-note and cluster stuff \nin 1.17. \nthen we have another one so this is um \nalso I love these kind of issues because \nif you see them so so this is I could \nguess you could either see this as a as \na as a buck or as an extension but I \nlove seeing those come in because those \ntwo me are signals that people are using \nand really using vb8 and production in \nthere sometimes running into some sort \nof limitation where maybe we sent we \ndidn't have something in scope yet and \num for this one the the example here is \nthat if you try to use bb8's oidc so \noadc is open ID connect so basically a \nstandard protocol for authentication and \nthat works with some oidc providers at \nthe moment but it doesn't work with some \nothers because while everything is \ncompatible with the spec some features \njust weren't supported yet and we got \nsome feedback that um yeah if you want \nto do I think it's I think it's Azure ad \nbut I'm not 100 sure like one of those \nproviders we're missing some features \nand this is about adding those missing \nfeatures to really support all these \nproviders and yeah make deviate more \nusable in production for for more users \nwhich I always like both that we're \ndoing it but also that that users are \nrequesting this and then we have another \none which is so this is a another really \ninteresting one this one was actually \ndriven by our webe account service team \num but it's it's something that everyone \nis going to benefit from so \num if you run out of memory on your vv8 \nmachine basically at some points in in \nprevious versions it which is Crash and \nthat's not their greatest ux so we have \na read-only feature already that's kind \nof Dynamics Dynamic so for example if \nyou run out of disk space you can have a \nconfigurable threshold to mark your your \nshards the charts or the components of \nyour index to mark them as read-only and \nand now we're going to have that same \nthing as well for running out of memory \nso basically what a memory threshold is \ncrossed that is as I said motivated from \nby our BBA cloud service team who is \nasking for for something like that to \nmake sure that that \num yeah the ux is great when when \nsomething like this happens so basically \nif it's read only we can handle it if \nit's crashing then it's much harder to \nhandle but this is of course something \nbeing aware the the needs from our VBA \ncloud service application really drives \nthe product forward and that everyone \nbenefits from also when you're \nself-hosting this so I really like how \nyeah the community needs and the the \nsort of business needs from from \nsomebody else the company behind vv8 are \num pretty much aligned \nyeah that that's it for 1.16 if you have \nany questions or feedback super curious \nto hear them we also have 1.17 on this \nlist but I'm not going to go in detail \nthrough this \num I think we can for example we could \ntackle this in a future one but lots of \nexciting stuff there as well \nso at the end I've got a question for \nyou so from the list that you just went \nover uh what is your uh favorite feature \nthat you're looking forward to \nimplementing \noh that's a that's a tough question uh \nlet me let me think about this so \nI think for me oh this is this is really \ndifficult because multiple of them have \nhave good reason for why they would be \nmy favorite can I can I get away with \ntwo \nsure just yeah okay okay then then for \ntwo I'm gonna go for the null values for \nthe reason that the the way that we got \nthere was so Community Driven like it \nwas if you open up this this issue which \nI can't right now because I I shared \nonly a single tap and if I open it it \nopens in it or it doesn't yeah it opens \nin a new tab for whatever reason uh so I \ncan can share it um but all of this is \ncommunity feedback so this is I really \njust love the the process I think some \nusers have been waiting for this for for \na while but at the same time that gave \nus the time to really go back and forth \nand get this early feedback end and we \ncan be sure that when we release this \nfeature that it's exactly what users \nhave been asking for which I I love it \nand and also implementation wise it's \nsuper cool that that yeah it's not too \ndifficult to do with our inverted index \nthat we already have so we have good \nbuilding blocks for that and then the \nthe other one uh for me is going to be \nthe multi-node cluster backup support \nwhich I think from a feature perspective \nis very very minimal it's just like okay \nit was a limitation and what not 15 you \njust had single node now you can do \nmulti-node but the kind of coordination \nthat we do with multi-nodes in the \nbackground that is a building block for \nreplication and now I'm spoiled it \nbasically what we're going to do in 1.17 \nbut one not 17 is going to be all about \nlike Dynamic cluster scaling and and um \nand replication and having the building \nblock in for that that is just that's a \na big win for me right now \nexcellent excellent thank you for the \nreview and um yeah this is pretty pretty \nexciting and I encourage everybody to uh \nreview the page and if you feel like you \nlike any of those features upvote it and \nthen let's see all those thumbs up going \nup uh and then because that definitely \nhelps us to put more effort in specific \nlike you know more popular features uh \nnot to say that we we will not take care \nof the other ones but uh that's kind of \nlike up you know thumbs up always helps \nour engineering team yeah especially for \nthe features that are in um in in the \nbacklog basically they're not \nprioritized yet because then we know \nlike this is something that you want \nthat's a very good point right because \nonce it's in 116 we kind of work on it \nalready right yeah yeah yeah like push \nthings forward a bit more yeah yeah like \nwe're probably not going to remove \nsomething from the list for 1.16 simply \nbecause it's it's just four weeks out we \nwe could still add something that that's \nsomething that could always happen but \nbasically the further we go in the \nfuture the more Dynamic it is and the \nmore uh we can still change it \nperfect uh thank you at the end so and \nand I have to say like I can guess quite \neasily what's Conor's favorite feature \non the list because that's definitely \nthe cross-reference centroid uh we all \nwant to see it in there so um let's move \nto the next part of the session uh so in \nthis part uh it's uh I'm going to pass \nit on to Connor who will give you an \noverview of like cool research that's \nbeen happening uh in AI uh so let me \njust share Connor's screen because he \nprepared a small presentation around \nthat \num and yeah and as as he goes through \nlike uh different items like uh please \nuh comment out uh give us a shout if you \nactually like any of those researchers \nor if you think like we should include \nthat in movie eight like that would be \nquite interesting to see too \num but yeah Conor uh what did you \nprepare for us \nawesome well first of all it's really \ncool to follow Eddie and with this I \nthink it's so interesting seeing kind of \nthe muscle behind the cloud service and \nthe oidc authentication all these things \nthat make it the search database and \nthen kind of coming in this intermediate \nbetween say the ref to VEC and the \nmuscle again of Parker Duckworth our \nengineer who built this together and \nthen kind of then the research side so I \nthink you can hopefully see the flow of \nhow all these things come together and I \nthink it's really interesting so as a \npart of my section I'm going to be kind \nof covering some new things that I saw \nin AI this month that I think are just \nextremely interesting and are things \nthat maybe we can see how to integrate \nwith weedgate and develop as features \nthat are kind of adjacent things that \nfuel the models and fuel the pipelines \nand these kind of things so it's \ndefinitely sort of biased towards search \nwith this selection of of what I think \nis interesting that came out this month \nand then um I say like kind of it's it's \nmy opinion sort of it's not like \neveryone's Collective opinion if I say \nsomething that's kind of opinionated \nabout some of these things so start off \nwith kind of just a quick topic overview \nI tried as best as I could to make this \nkind of sequentially organized a little \nbit but really it's a it kind of the \nfirst general thing is about training \nretrieval models how do we get these \nmodels that produce embeddings of data \nand what are the new advances in that \nthen we have some new advances in \nlearning to search and then this Chain \nof Thought prompting thing continues to \nevolve and this self-ask thing is just a \nmassive step through with this and the \nway that we use these language models \nand the way that we tie these language \nmodels with search engines so I'd say if \nI had a central topic for this it's \nthinking heavily about what is the \nrelationship between large language \nmodels and the vector the weba vector \nsearch engine and sort of language \nmodels and search and how they play \ntogether so then we'll kind of look at \none paper that um you know maybe the \ntitle generate rather than retrieve \nisn't a title that we would love with \nour current design so I'd like to kind \nof you know still entertain these \narguments and say what they're saying is \nthe drawback to the Gen to the current \nretrieve and read Pipeline and how they \ngenerate then then read pipeline work \nand so sort of my counter Arguments for \nthis as well I think I want to talk a \nlittle more about retrieval augmented \nlanguage models so Facebook AI I think \nother institutions as well they have \nthis Atlas model \nwhere it's this 11 billion parameter \nretrieved and read that also achieves \nthis few shot learning and I listened to \nPatrick Lewis uh talk at the Boston NLP \nMeetup about this about how you can \ndecouple Knowledge from reasoning \nessentially with this kind of Paradigm \nand this is also they have a new re \nimage and model Imogen is the uh the \nGoogle diffusion text image model and so \nthey have a retrieval augmented \ndiffusion model as well that I'd like to \ntalk about with this General class of \nretrieval augmented language models so \nvery heavy in the theme of language \nmodels and search what is the \nrelationship what do they each offer how \ndo they complement each other \nand play together so then I mean this \nother paper is just wild two exclamation \nmarks this set fit contrastive learning \ncan achieve few shot learning as well \nthis way of fine-tuning sentence \nTransformers and then putting a \nclassification head on top of it the I \njust was like I can't believe this can \nachieve that as well and then I'd like \nto just quickly uh touch on some \nexciting emerging applications \num like Facebook has a make a video and \nthen there's a new um uh edit eval which \nis about sort of creating data sets \naround editing text not just generating \ntext and I think this is incredibly \ninteresting as well and then we have \njust an absolutely incredible interview \nstudy of ml Ops practices this is just \nlike the sort of like the ml Ops book \nit's a paper but it's like the ml Ops \nbook that you've always wished you had \nwith describing like best practices and \norganizing these experiments and \ndeploying these models and just all \nsorts of incredible like nuggets to take \naway with if you like that kind of \nthinking so \nto kick it off let's talk about \npromptigator so promptigator is super \ninteresting different retrieval tasks \nhave very different search intents in \nother words different definitions of \nrelevance so the title is few shot dense \nretrieval from eight examples but the \nidea being that we need to generate data \nto train our retrieval models depending \non what kind of application you have \nthere are many different distributions \nof search queries and intents with your \nsearch so if you look on the far left \nyou see with Ms Marco you say you have \nquestions like surgeon salary per year \nbut Ms Marco is just like thing you \nwould things you would hit the Bing \nsearch engine with compared to Fever \nwhere you have claims like music artists \nis a profession of Christina Aguilera's \nor like entity surge or counter argument \nretrieval so hopefully just from looking \nat these different kind of queries you \ncan see that they require different \nkinds of query embedding models will \nwork better if they're more tailored to \na particular kind of query distribution \nso what they're doing is they have \nthey're using large language models to \ngenerate training data for retrieval \nmodels for particular kind of search \ntasks or search retrieval needs so what \nyou do is you have this few shot prompt \nwhere you say give eight examples again \nof what a document query pair would look \nlike for this particular task and then \nyou just swipe in your whole you just \nrotate in your whole data set filling in \nthat D and it will generate queries for \neach of the documents depending on your \ntask so as an example this arguana's \ndata set is different from natural \nquestions Ms Marco you're particularly \nlooking for counter arguments in the \nsearch task so you know you make some \nclaim like language models only achieve \ngood performance at 10 billion \nparameters and then you want to go hit \nthe scientific literature and find \ncounter arguments to that it's a \ndifferent kind of search task than \nquestion answering in these other models \nso few shop propagator is able to \nsuccessfully adapt to this task with a \nfew examples by generating training data \nlike this and then you use this training \ndata to train the text retrieval models \nso pretty much the idea is you use the \nlarge language model to generate a \ntraining data set to distill into say \nthe 22 million parameter retrieval model \nand I think this makes a lot of sense as \na \nis like an interesting way for how we \nuse language models in Search and \nparticularly the you know the search \nVector search setup that we're \nenvisioning \nso here's some results of the propagator \nand you can also train a cross encoder \nthis way so when you retrieve you can \nsay retrieve a thousand examples and \nthen re-rank them with a cross encoder \nand svidlon has done this incredible \nillustration of a comic book with a \nfisherman and this example where with \nthe retrieval you cast the big fishing \nnet and then you get some fish onto the \nboat and then the fishermen have to look \nthrough each of the fish and that's the \nidea of having a cross encoder that does \nthose pairwise but you can also train it \nby bootstrapping the data for that in \nthe same way and it's also interesting \nto see this evaluated on the um beir \nBenchmark of diverse domains and diverse \ninformation retrieval tests \nso the next topic I thought was \ninteresting it wasn't a whole paper but \nuh this query to query model where it's \nsaying two queries are equivalent if the \nuser is searching with those queries are \nlooking for the same set of results and \nthat's kind of the that's the core \nmotivation for how we're going to \nbootstrap this training function to \nfurther improve these query embedding \nmodels so it starts off with some \nmotivation about different aspects of \nquerying where uh where you you have the \nsame query and you're looking for the \nsame thing even though it's a difficult \nsort of natural language understanding \ntask you might say uh The Rock Dwayne \nJohnson if you're say looking for movies \nand you're referring to the same person \nand all these other examples of how \nthese queries can differ each other but \nhave the same information needs so what \nthey do is they use a query log and so I \nimagine that as we think about things we \nbuild into weviate is you would have \nsome kind of search log with the clicks \nand you would see what queries resulted \nin the same uh in the same click so it's \ndifferent queries result in the same \nclicks and you use that to bootstrap \nthis positive labeling as we have this \ncontrastive learning framework which is \nhow we're producing these things we're \nthinking the same results those are \npositives versus negatives so they've \nopen source the data set and you know \nreported some results with their \nparticular data set \nthe next topic I think this is crazy \ninteresting as well is about search \nagents how can we have agents this \nreinforcement learning State action \ntransition thing that learn how to \nsearch and model the rabbit hole of \nhuman Searchers so I think this example \nis really great and I think most of us \nkind of search like this you might do a \nquery like what is the weather like in \nGermany in June and then you get some \nresults you go actually let me add the \nkeyword temperatures to this let me add \nthe keyword average to this so that's \nthe key idea is we're going to be having \nthree actions to refine the query with \nthe bm25 search which is either add \nanother keyword remove a keyword or \nboost the term importance of a keyword \nand so the general framework looks like \nthis where you have the hybrid search \nbetween bm25 and a dense retrieval model \nand then you have a T5 re-ranker and \nthen you have this T5 query formulator \nwhich is the thing that's trying to \nreinforced from learning to learn how to \ncontrol the bm25 to do this depth of \nsearching and I think this could just be \nan incredibly interesting controller \nin the kind of design of these search \npipelines so then the next topic is um \nreally this is really a mind-blowing \nthing that's happened in AI yesterday \neven so I had to kind of scramble to add \nthis to the slides but \nso the new method uh self-ass that \nimproves results over Chain of Thought \nprompting by having the language model \nexplicitly State and answer follow-up \nquestions before answering the input \nquestion \nso I'm kind of going to put this here \nfor a second and take a quick breakdown \nto coffee but \nokay so here's the idea so in gpt3 they \nhave this thing called in context few \nshot learning where you provide examples \nof the task the question would be who \nlived longer Theodore hacker Harry \nVaughn answer Harry Von Watkins \nand then you give it the new inference \nthe new question that generates the \nanswer so the few shot in the sense is \nhowever many of these question answered \npairs you're going to put in the input \nfor the gpt3 then they came up with this \nidea called Chain of Thought prompting \nand this was absolutely an incredible \nidea what you you show it how to answer \nthese questions how to decompose these \nquestions explicitly so who lived longer \nTheodore hacker or Harry Von Watkins and \nthen you explicitly show it how to do \nthis Chain of Thought where you first \nrecall that theater hacker was 65 years \nold when he died Harry Von Watkins was \n69 years old when he died so the final \nanswer is Harry Von Watkins so that \nworked extremely well for a lot of these \nthings and you see like gpt3 solving \nmath problems doing coding this kind of \nChain of Thought prompting is really \nshowing how to query the language model \nand access what it's learned and now the \nnew idea is self-ass so it's a it's a \nbetter way of doing these prompts so you \nsay question who lived longer Theodore \nhacker or Harry Von Watkins and the new \nthing is you say are follow-up questions \nneeded here yes and then you ask another \nquestion and you keep rolling it this \nway to answer this thing a particular \ncompositional questions \nso this is the thing is there are \ndifferent kinds of questions that you \ncan answer if you just cut this off and \nsay who won the Masters Tournament \nyou're just recalling a single fact \ncompared to multi-hop or compositional \nquestion answering where you have to \nchain together information so they've \nreleased this new data set with \nquestions like who won the Masters \nTournament the year Justin Bieber was \nborn so it's not like the kind of thing \nthat you've seen in the training data \nyou have to do this compositional \nreasoning and this compositional \ngeneralization this is probably the \nhottest Topic in deep learning right now \nuh so oh and then another really \ninteresting thing about this \nis not just having the language model \nanswer the follow-up queries you would \nyou would send these queries to the \nsearch engine and I think this is this \ndiagram right here is just an incredibly \ninteresting visualization of how we can \nhave these large language models we V8 \nVector search engine how they can play \ntogether to just build incredible \ntechnology like this \nthe next huge topic and I think this is \njust incredibly exciting how these \nconcrete numbers are coming out Mosaic \nml has updates on their Mosaic ml Cloud \nfor the cost of training GPT models and \nwe'll sort of get into all the \noptimizations they do with the \nmulti-node scaling the resumption one uh \nruns crash or lost bikes are detected \nand the way that they do the data \nparallelism with the pi torch fsdb and \nthen the uh the compute optimal trading \nlaws for how they tell you that you know \nthis is this is the compute optimal uh \nscale of the number of tokens you should \ntrain at 30 billion pretty much if \nyou've seen these papers and like neural \nscaling laws it doesn't make any sense \nto keep training these models past this \ncompute optimal point so I think looking \nat this you'll see that it's it's still \nkind of expensive because we're seeing \nthat there's like this phase shift with \nthese language models where when they \nhit around that 6.7 billion parameter \nMark is when there's this emergent \nphenomenon where they start to perform \nreally interestingly but I think just \ngetting these details out there having \nthese concrete numbers is just \nincredibly interesting \nso now we're going to look into a \ncounter argument about how you would do \ninformation retrieval with generate \nrather than retrieve so the idea being \nthat uh you would generate documents \ninstead of retrieving them and they \nargue three drawbacks to Modern debts \nretrieval methods that that I think are \nkind of worth seeing if these are valid \nor not the first argument is the \nrepresentations of questions and \ndocuments are obtained independently \nleading to only shallow interactions \ncaptured between them so this is \ndiscussing how you would separately \nvectorize the entire document Corpus and \nthen vectorize the question and saying \nthat this is this is missing out \ncompared to where you say take the \nquestion and the document as input to \ngenerate something \nand then they discussed uh you know the \nproblem with say you only embed it into \na single vector and I think they cite \nthe Colbert paper on this idea of having \nuh these multiple Vector representations \nat the token level as well later \ninteraction and that kind of thing and \nthen they discussed that the sort of \nthey argue that the limitation of the \ndocument index is that it limits the \nsort of size of the embedding vectors \nand can't use the large language models \ndirectly in this way \nbut I would say that there's kind of \nthree drawbacks as well the language \nmodels is that they're hard to update \nthey're not as interpretable as the \nretrieve and read and then you know it's \nmore parameter efficient to do this way \nbecause we don't need to store the data \nin the parameters and that also says \nit's just there's something to it being \nlike ground truth information that \nyou're retrieving compared to the \ngeneration and I don't think it's that \nit's solved to avoid the hallucination \nproblem things like this but \nso I yeah I don't want to go in on this \ntoo much but they also have this idea \nwhere they we're looking into something \ncalled bird topic where you have these \ndifferent clusters and you use this to \nprompt it to to sample diversity in the \ngeneration I think this is an example of \nyou still have the embedding index to \nget the prompt so they're the way that \nthey're kind of proving it is by using \nthe the embedding set with the Clusters \nand then finally I'm just it still \nrequires large language models to get \nthis emerging performance so as they're \nshowing this chart it takes up to 100 \nbillion parameters to get this working \nwell so I still think that this idea is \nisn't as far ahead as just the retrieve \nand read but it could be interesting to \nhave a hybrid search maybe in the future \nwhen we say hybrid search will mean \ngenerate and neural retrieve and bm25 \nrather than right now we're mostly mean \nneural retrieve and bm25 \nbut anyway so the next topic is about \nfuchsia learning with retrieval \naugmented language models decouple \nKnowledge from reasoning but the idea of \nbeing um \nlanguage models have achieved this few \nshot learning ability where you can give \nthem like four examples of input outputs \nand then they can do novel inferences \nand that's just probably the most \nexciting thing about language models so \nthis report is studying is can these \nretrieval augmented language models or \nrather than just having a whole dense \narchitecture you retrieve and then read \ncan that also perform this few shot \nlearning task \nso they find that you can using this \nmassively multitask Benchmark and I \nthink it's just incredibly interesting \nthat you can also get this two-shot \nlearning with a much smaller model than \na lot of these dense language models \nand then this is what I think is the big \nsell of these models what what you're \nlooking at is you you can update these \nretrieve augmented language models you \nhave uh answers from 2017 that when they \nwhen it's 2020 they're outdated so say \nwho won the NBA Championship or who is \nthe president of the United States or \nlike things like this where they change \nover time with the retrieve augmented \nlanguage model you can just swap out the \ninformation and update it extremely easy \nand I think that's a really interesting \nproperty of this \nso then we'll talk about what is \nretrieval augmented models look like in \nimage generation so I I hope that a lot \nof you are interested in these diffusion \nmodels where uh what they do is they you \nnoise it and then you learn to denoise \nit by having this kind of uned and then \nattention to the text prompt which helps \nyou in doing this uh learning task so \nwhat they're doing is they're retrieving \nadditional images and text prompts to \nguide the diffusion so it's not just \nconditioned on the text prompt it's also \nconditioned on the nearest Neighbors in \nthe database and they share that \nparticularly what this is really good \nfor is generating specific entities so \nif you're saying um a barbato day I \ncan't say that a Bravado de Church \nSierra is standing by a river and it's a \nparticular kind of dog image gen Dolly \nthey won't generate that particular dog \nbut if you augment it with the retrieval \ncomponent it'll generate that particular \nthing and I think this incredibly \npowerful for how these models are going \nto be actually useful \nuh so then we'll talk about this idea of \nset fit that is able to achieve few shot \nLearning Without large language models \nand so it's able to do this by say you \nhave eight labeled examples you train a \nsentence Transformer with uh contrastive \nlearning and then you train a classifier \non top of that and surprisingly just \nthis pipeline is able to work extremely \nwell they show that it Rivals the \nRoberta large is only eight examples on \nthis customer review data set \nuh so then just quickly I wanted to just \nsay that I think that this kind of \napplication of studying editing text \nrather than just generating text is \ngoing to be extremely interesting for \nhow we interface with these natural \nlanguage processing systems and having \nsomething that can suggest edits to your \nto your text is probably more useful \nthan something that just generates text \ndirectly having like a thoughtful review \nof something and so they've published \nthis data set where they have these \ndifferent tasks like Clarity coherence \nfluency things that say you label for \nand edit when you're giving somebody a \nreview of their blog post or something \nokay so finally the last thing is this \noperationalizing machine learning and \ninterview study uh make generally \norganizing MLS practices around velocity \nvalidation and having versions of models \ndescribing this General pipeline of \nmachine learning from data collection to \nexperimentation evaluation deployment \nand then monitoring and response also \nthings like run layer pipeline layer \ncomponent layer infrastructure layer and \nan mlav stack and so there are a lot of \nreally interesting quotes but generally \nthe organized around the idea of \nvelocity where you quickly prototype and \niterate on ideas validation how you test \nyour models and then versioning so when \nthe model has failed you can you know \nroll it back to a previous machine \nlearning model that you had in the \nsystem \nso there's a lot of quotes in here and I \nI feel like I'm maybe going over the \ntime limit but um like I just highly \nrecommend having to look through this \nand seeing all this advice on things \nlike Jupiter notebooks how you find \nsubpopulations in your data to do the \nevaluation and how to really do this \nkind of versioning I think the whole \nthing is just \nchock full of wisdom and how to build \nthese systems \nokay I hope that was a good overview of \nnew and AI maybe a little longer than I \nthought so going in but um I think kind \nof the most interesting thing is \nthinking about large language models \ntheir advances and what this has to do \nwith search \nperfect thank you Connor for this uh \ngreat overview so I think one of the \nthings I was thinking um was can are you \ngoing to share the links to any of those \npapers or like maybe so that if any of \nus wants to go and find those papers \num could we do something about it like \nuh send it via tweet or something \nyeah I can put like a blog post with the \nlinks to all these papers as well \nperfect yeah so if you if any of you \nfollows us on like a V8 uh i o \num tweet on Twitter \nhandle I forgot how to speak for a \nmoment uh we will just tweet a link to \nhow to find maybe those references and \nand I think that would be pretty cool \nbecause there's so much uh of yeah such \na big wealth of knowledge it's great to \nsee \num yeah great and uh do you have like a \nfavorite of the papers from those 11 \nthat you talked about \nI think probably self-ask is the most \ninteresting sort of but uh I mean I \nthink I've already I picked all these \nthings because I think they all do \nsomething very interesting but this kind \nof have the language model \nprompted to Think Through is I think \npretty \nincredible \nexcellent thank you I mean yeah of \ncourse like all of them like are super \ninteresting it's just but we can still \nhave like our favorites uh right that's \nthat's kind of the thing \ncool all right so let's move to the \nfinal part of the presentation so I'm \ngoing to invite Erica back to the stream \nhey Erica \num so Erica is going to show us \num a quick demo of an application that \nshe's been working on so I'm going to \nshare her screen now \num so yeah I'm really excited about \num the dog search demo Erica like what \ncan you tell us about it all right a \nlittle sneak peek is it contains images \nof dogs and I'll share the motivation \nfrom my little dog Bowen \nmy name is Erica Cardenas and I'm a part \nof the devrel team and today I will be \ngoing over a demo on using the uh inch \nto back neural module from weaviate \nuh so this is Bowen the developer \nAdvocate \num excuse my little dog at Connors too \nuh she is two years old and one thing \nshe loves to do while she has a few \ngames um she likes catching uh being \nchased by humans or other dogs \num she likes treats and yeah she's just \na really playful dog so here is Bowen in \na dog park playing with her best friend \nOllie so what she enjoys to do is yeah \nthe chase game kind of running around \nvery fast and \num she loves going to the dog park and \ninteracting with a few dogs so this dog \npark is a little empty but usually there \nare a ton of different dog breeds so \nBowen asked the question of oh can I \nfigure out what kind of uh breed this \ndog is based off of the image I said \nsure Bowen let's build this demo with \nusing alleviate and python Plus for the \nweb application right so let's get into \nit uh so we were building an image \nrecognition uh demo and we're using the \ninch to back neural module from Wi-Fi \num what this does is it converts images \ninto vectors so we can search through \nthem and it uses the resnet50 \narchitecture trained on imagenet and \nimagenet is a data set that has 20 000 \nclasses over 10 million labeled images \nso this is quite large and as you can \nguess there are quite a few images of \ndog breeds so this is the best reviate \nmodule to use but also using the \nresonant 50 architecture \nall right so Bowen has the \num well Bowen all she had was the idea \nright so I said okay let's create a data \nproperty so this has the name which is \nthe dog breed the image of the dog and \nalso the final path so \num later on when I built when I built \nthe web application uh we'll be dropping \nin an image and it will spit out the \nmost similar \num dog image in our data set \nall right so let's open up the \napplication \nall right starting off with the docker \ncompose file so maybe it makes this \nextremely easy so here we have the uh \nvectorizer module so we just specified \nthat we're using the image to VEC and \nthen also that we are using the resnet \n50 model and that's currently the \num only one I believe that is offered on \nwheat beets but I'm sure there will be \nmore soon \nall right so once we load up our Docker \nfile now we can go on to creating the \nschema \num so here we are just uh connecting to \nour localhost and then we are building \nthe schema of our DOT class so it is it \ncontains images of different dogs and we \nalso have \num we are specifying which backyards are \nwe are using which I have stated um is \nthe image to back all right and then our \nproperty so we have breed which is a \nstring we have the image which is a blob \ntype a data type and then we also have \nthe file path so when we use the near \nimage operator it will output the file \npath to the image \num and then we are just going to add the \nschema \nnow and we need to upload our data \nobjects to aviate so we are again \nconnecting to our local host and uh \nbefore this in order to have a blob you \nneed to convert or yeah in order to \nupload your images to Evie you need to \nconvert your images to base64 values so \nI've already created the folder that has \nthe conversion \num so in lines 10 to 14 I am just \nopening this and then an 18 to 23 these \nare just the data properties which we \nhave already specified in our data \nschema and then we're creating a unique \nidentifier for each data object and then \nin line 28 we are just uploading this to \nev8 so that we can use it and search \nthrough \nand since we are using the python uh we \nV8 the python client I decided why not \nbuild a web application in Python so we \nare using flask \num lines one and seven are just a few \nlibraries that are necessary \num to build our application \num so here we are building in line 9 to \n11 we are building are up \nand in lines 13 to 27 this is the home \npage so this is the landing page when we \nrun our application.pi file \num it will output the URL and we're \ngoing to run that and what you're going \nto see are the images that are in our \ndata set which are about uh yeah we have \n10 different dog breeds \nin lines 29 to 38 is where we are \nrunning the near image or constructing \nthe near image operator in vb8 so we're \njust limiting that to two outputs and uh \nyeah just letting it limiting it to two \nand what is going to \num what the output is going to be is the \nfile path and the breed name so if I \nupload an image of Bowen I want the \nresults to Output golden doodle and a \ngolden retriever rather than a \nRottweiler because they are not similar \nat all I think you guys know but the \nsize and also the color \num \nall right so in lines 42 uh 57 this is \nreally where we're just um opening up \nour image and we are \num so once we upload the image we need \nto be able to store it and then we also \nwant to Output it so that that's kind of \njust what this code is doing and then \nwe're just rendering that template and \nhaving it structured in that aspect and \nif we \num in line 60 to 61 we're just running \nthe application so I think that was an \noverview of the code are there any \nquestions Sebastian I don't have it open \nare we good to see the app \nI think what we we should probably uh \nshow the app and just to show everyone \nhow yeah how you build it but I think \nit's really cool because basically that \nfunction there where you have just uh \ncalling uh this this search with the \nnear image uh it's really where a lot of \nthe magic happens right like once you \nimported the data and did the \nvectorization uh it's really cool so uh \nwhat what can Bowen do now with this app \nshow us \nall right let's \nall right so here's our app with our 10 \ndog images we have a Bernice Mountain \nDog a corgi Rottweiler we have it all \nalmost right so let's upload an image of \na mini golden doodle \nlet's submit it and what comes up is the \ngolden doodle and golden retriever which \nis exactly what we were looking for so \nnow a phone goes to the dog park and she \nsees this dog she can say hey that's a \ngolden retriever I know I'm the nearest \nneighbor to it and I want to play with \nit so now Bowen's curious mind is uh \nshe's happy huh I could say \nnice and and what happens if you if you \nif she tries to look for some friends uh \nthat she's seen yes let's drop in a \nsilver lab \nthat's more similar too all right we \nhave the labrador achiever and gold \nretriever which basically the same dog \nso it works and now yeah you can search \nfor various dog images and we can always \ninclude more and then also add in more \nto our data properties like weight and \nnot that we all want to think about this \nbut it's the lifespan of the dog so \nshe's like Hey will this dog be in this \ndog park 10 years from now maybe maybe \nnot \ngot it yeah \nI really like how uh in this demo like \nit's not that like the dogs can be \ncompletely like you know can be \ndifferent color \nEtc because like uh when when you search \nfor like a golden doodle right like you \nfound one that actually has different \nfur uh but it's still a similar breed so \nlike the the ml model is actually pretty \nsmart I'm quite impressed \num so what's going to happen next with \nthis demo what's what's the plan how can \nwe share with the with our audience \nall right of course um so I will be \npushing this to GitHub so anyone can \naccess it and it also contains a readme \nfile so it's actually quite simple to \nrun it I've made it as simple as \npossible with just using python \num and we can always add to it add more \ndog breeds add more images and just \ncontinue building on this \nPlace \nyeah because I think we're going to \npublish it in our uh we made examples \num and and I would actually encourage \nanyone to kind of like hey help us make \nthis application look great and then and \nalso test it out like if you have a \nwhole bunch of Docker images that you \nwant to test out uh you should \ndefinitely uh check it out in with \nexamples it should land there soon \num but also I I know it already as I'm \nnot gonna ask directly I reckon but we \nare working on a blog post that explains \nthe whole journey of how this \napplication was built how you could \nactually use the image to vac uh module \num so yeah like it should be up in the \ncouple of weeks and we'll be sharing \nthat for sure yeah \num so uh what's Bowen's opinion on it \ndoes she like the application has she \ntried \nshe's happy she's happy is she is she \naround is she in the room with you \nyes come on we should we should all show \nabout people and like let me go you know \nokay the motivation of this app right \nabsolutely yeah let's um \nthe Bowen is a real dog she's a real \ncustomer and Erica wasn't building the \napplication just for fun \num and we are super excited there she is \nhey Bowen next time we should definitely \nget bow and like her own stream \nall day or is at the dog park so maybe \nI'll include images of her next time the \ndog park excellent excellent and I know \nat the end as a Doctor Who's super cute \nas well but I guess uh he's not around \nright \noh not not ready for her \ndefinitely the dog is too big to lift \nlike that right \nhe's a golden retriever so it's I guess \noh Still Still lift him but yeah I was \nthinking about the selection of dog \nthere's this like this is a great \nselection of of dogs I don't know if \nthese are like the most common breeds or \nsomething but I my parents had a Bernice \nmountain dog when uh when I was growing \nup so that was that was super cool now I \nhave a golden retriever \num Labradors are super common huskies \nare super cute German Shepherds are I \nthink they're just super pretty dogs I \nlove this selection yeah just looking at \nthe dogs \nI have done more to it but yeah these \nwere just the ones that came to my mind \nlike the ones that I see the most often \nI feel like \nwell thank you perfect thank you for \nthis demo it was it was amazing um and \nactually so you should be all like uh \npretty impressed with this demo because \nthat's something that Erica just started \nI think last week so this is really like \nsomething that you can build uh really \nquickly if you know you know a bit about \nvv8 if you know a bit about machine \nlearning if you you know you could pick \nup flaska over you know a day or two and \nyou could straight away build a really \ncool demos \num so yeah I'm really curious what other \nideas Bowen will have for our future \ndemos \nperfect uh I think this was a pretty \nsuccessful uh first episode of viviate \nair uh thank you all for watching us \num I I really enjoyed myself there was \nso much to learn uh but that would be \nreally curious um to learn right like \nthis basically this is the first live \nepisode that we've done and I'm sure we \ncan do it better I'm sure we can maybe \ninclude some other ideas \num so please share your feedback with us \nyou can do it on Twitter you can join at \nthe uh with this public slack I would \ndefinitely recommend doing that uh and \num or maybe if you think like you have \nsomething really cool to share maybe you \nbuild something with viviate uh that \ncould be you know a cool thing maybe you \ncould join us for five ten minutes uh we \ncould always accommodate the format and \nmake that happen but that's at least \nfrom me uh anyone else anything to add \nno well thank you all for joining and if \nyou guys enjoy the demo and replicate it \nyeah absolutely I love how we're \nbridging this Gap from from sort of \ngetting started so quickly to going all \nthe way to like super complex cases in \nproduction now basically you can you can \nuse VBA to get started and you can use \nbb8 for you can keep using it as you \ngrow which is which is super cool yeah \nalso thank you for my side super cool I \nI was planning on on watching this \nepisode and then I got invited last \nminute so I guess I still watched it \nyeah I was I was looking at the roadmap \npage and I was I was going to talk about \nit in front of everyone and then I was \nlike oh at here doesn't have anything on \nthis calendar let's let's rock him in \nyeah because I didn't schedule anything \nat air time \nexactly so like for anyone that works at \nsemi like if you don't want to be rope \nteam randomly like uh invent a meeting \nwith a customer or somebody \nof an excuse \nbut it would be great all right very \ncool \nsuper great that you were all able to \njoin us and um see you next month and I \nthink uh just to double check the next \nepisode probably be will be planned for \nthe 2nd of November so the whole idea is \nthat we want to run those on every first \nWednesday of the month \num so yeah thank you for watching and \nsee you in the next \nwe'll be there thank you \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Air \u2013 Episode #1", "path": "", "link":
