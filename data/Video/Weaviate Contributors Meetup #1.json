{"text": "This is the recording of Weaviate's first contributors meetup, presented by Laura Ham. More information: - Weaviate ... \nso let's get started uh so yeah again \nwelcome um i'm uh lava solution engineer \nnow at uh semi technologies and today i \nwanna uh \nintroduce uh review to you and also \na bit on how how you can contribute to \nthis \nuh so first a little bit about uh vvate \nand \nyeah the problems that it solves so what \nwhat is it exactly \nand i will demonstrate this with uh some \nqueries uh so you see how it works and \nwhat it can do \nuh i will get uh i will then explain you \nhow viviet actually does this so a \nlittle bit uh \nmore towards the technology um \nand then i will show you how to get \nstarted and how you can contribute \nand then in the end we can have uh some \nquestions and maybe a discussion if \nyou're open to that \nso first a little bit about revit itself \nso \nabout the ai-based semantic search \nengine \nwe identified that or we know from \nsources that \naround 80 of the data is unstructured \ntext \nand this comes from forbes actually and \nthe problem \nthat comes with this is that it's \ndifficult to search through \nand it's difficult to classify data \nso what exactly is unstructured text i \nhave an example here of \nthree product reviews of disputed \nproducts \nand we see that we have some \n[Music] \nrating in number of stars we have a date \nso that's kind of structured data \nbut we also like most of the data is \nactually text itself \nand \nthis text is difficult to \nto search through if you are not \nsearching by \nexact matching keywords but also \nthere's a lot of information hidden in \nthese texts \nso words like fear and worry and \nthat this person thinks it's absolutely \namazing are all things that \nare hidden in this text and you can do \nsearch and classification for this \nso how is this problem solved right now \nsearch is \nuh for example already solved by \nenhancing the \ntraditional search engines with machine \nlearning capabilities \nor through manual effort and \nclassification \nis uh already solved partly by data \nscientists who \nwho make models and manual effort well \nwhat are the problems with this \nso search which is \nuh solved partly by machine learning \ncapabilities what we see mostly is that \nthere's just a machine learning wrapper \naround the results that traditional \nsearch engines \nreturn and \nso that partly solves the problem but \nit's just really difficult to scale \nmostly on large data sets \nthen of course data scientists are able \nto make really nice classification \nmodels already \nbut we see that data scientists are \noverqualified to do \nlike most of the most of the work that \nthey're actually doing like the \npre-processing of data \nand of course they want to build models \ninstead of just pre-processing and all \nthat stuff \nand then of course manual effort that's \nthat's really expensive and slow \nand mistakes can happen if you for \nexample miss classified data here \nand this is where we fiat comes in and \nv8 is a vector search engine \nwhich means that it has built-in machine \nlearning models \nto index data and yeah this automatic \nfactor representation of data \nenables to search through it and this \nenables that you can find \nactually data without using exact \nmatching keywords but just by \nproviding context or semantics \nit is a it has a graph like data model \nso the database itself is not a graph \ndatabase but it's \nbuilt upon a graph structure and \nthen next it's completely api based so \nit has a restful api \nbut more importantly a graphql api which \nmakes the user experience \npretty good because you can exactly get \nwhat you're asking for and do semantic \nsearches with this \ni'll show this later it's completely \ncloud native so you can run it anywhere \nit has a open source core which means \nwell that's also why we're here for \nright so it it's all \nuh it's all run on um it's all all the \ncode sorry it's on \non github and you can you can see \neverything in here \nand then uh what we see right now is \nmostly used for automatic classification \nand semantic search but we also have use \ncases where vp8 is used as \ncore infrastructure for a database \nso that's also possible so first i will \ni will show you how this uh works um \ni have a little demo here uh what you \nsee here is the \nis what we call the vv8 console it's a \ngraphical user interface what we built \nto \nto query alleviate and in this field i \ncan make queries \nin this you will see the results in json \nformat \nand for this demo i use the \ni use one of our two demo data sets \nwhich contains \nnews publications and articles from the \nus \nand this contains about uh 3500 \narticles which is not that much but it's \nenough for \nfor a demo of course so \num yeah let's let's see how graphql \nworks and how \nqueries are built up and just to see \nwhat kind of data is in there \nso i always start like this and for now \ni want to \nsee what kind of data is in there so i \nstart with the get function \nand see what kind of things and then \nfrom here \nwe can see what kind of \nclasses we have defined so in this data \nset we can ask for articles \nauthors categories and publications so \nlet's see what kind of publications are \nin there \nand i just want to see their the name \nfor now so i press \nenter and i see different um \n[Music] \npublications so i have around 20 \npublications in here \nfinancial times new yorkers folk etc \nand we could do the same with articles \nso if i do articles and \nthe title then i see there there's many \nmany articles \nand of all different kinds so this is \nabout super bowl \nthere's five reasons to live in cologne \ngermany and so on \nbut as you can see here this is there's \nno magic happening here i'm just \nrequesting some data from my database \nthis is not something really special um \nso now i would like to show how the \nsemantic search then then actually works \nand this is \nwhere the power of rev8 is of course \ncoming in \nso let's get back to the publications \nand if i want to do a semantic search i \ncan add a filter \nto this class publication \nand we call we call this the explore \nfunction so \nwe want to explore what kind of data is \nin there and then see the results \nand the concepts define your search term \nso let's say i'm looking for \npublications around the concept of \nfashion \nand i don't want to see everything \nreturned \nbut i want to be sure that we've had \nassured that 75 \nthat the result is 75 certain that it's \nactually about fashion \nso what i'm doing now is i'm still \ngetting things i'm getting publications \nand just their name \nbut only those that are 75 percent \nuh sure that it's it's around the \nconcept of fashion \nand now uh and this is where it gets \ninteresting now only \nthe publication focus returned and as \nyou can see here \nit nowhere uses the concept or the word \nfashion and the fact that this \npublication is returned folk is just \nbecause there are articles \nfor example linked to this publication \nthat are about fashion that mention \nwords like words like clothes and trends \nmaybe \nbut it has built this context around the \npublication \nthat it knows it's about fashion so now \nif we change it to \nfinance for example we see that folk \ndisappears \nand we get back financial times and \neconomies \nand of course we could we could do the \nsame with uh with the articles \nso if i change publications to articles \nagain \nask for the title um maybe not about \nfinance but now about traveling \ni get back all publications about \ntraveling so \nthe future of travel in 2020 uh \ncruises so here you see there's no word \ntravel used but \nv8 knows that cruises uh \nis related to traveling and that's why \nit gets returned here \nand we can make these queries even more \nspecific \nso let's say i'm not only interested in \ntravel but specifically \nin in in sailing or traveling \nby boat or on the c then i can \nadd a filter and it's called move to \nfilter move to \nmeans i'm literally moving through uh \nthe space \nof our data so i start with travel \nand i move i want to move to another \nconcept \nand as i said let's move to sailing \nand we can move with a certain force \nlet's apply it quite strong here \nand i press enter i see that only \nresults around sailing or in this case \ncruising \ncruising rain is about rivers uh \nget return so that's how the semantic \nsearch works it \nyou don't have uh to return only the \ndata that has \nexact matching keywords but it's just \nabout the semantics and the concepts \num so now i just uh entered single words \nbut this also works if you \nput a whole natural language sentence in \nthere so let's say traveling in \ncorona times and we see that \nif that we get an article back \neverything travelers need to know about \nthe huan \nkorana virus so it makes \na search query around these concepts \nand i can quickly show you that we use a \ngraph \ndatabase or graph structure in the \ndatabase \nso all the articles in this demo set are \nlinked to certain publications \nso i can also ask for in which \npublications all the single articles \nappear i can do this like this \nand ask for the name \nso now i not only ask for the title but \nalso for the publication \nand here i can see i have this was the \nfirst \nresult so the everything travelers need \nto know about the coronavirus \nand is published in in cnn so this is \nwhere the graph structure comes in \nall right um \nso let's get back to the slides \nso how how does this actually work \nuh how how can it return things that \ndon't have the exact matching keywords \nand this is uh because we built viviate \nin or we represent data \nin a large vector space and \nthis is in contrast to like row column \num there are traditional databases \nand also not in a graph structure but \nit's it's an effective space and \na vector space in our case consists of \n300 dimensions and \nin their words and concepts and data \nobjects are \nplaced using coordinates which are \ncalled factors \nand weaver learns the context of data \nobjects and words \nby representing them in this 300 \ndimensional space \nand here i will use three dimensions for \nsimplification \nbecause i mean who can imagine 300 \ndimensions \nso what you see here is actually an \nempty viviate \nand all the pink dots that you see \nthat is that are concepts and words in \nthe pre-trained language model \nas i explained earlier so if you use \nvvate \nit now comes with a pre-trained um \nlanguage model which is used to \nindex the data that you add later and \nhow these dots are \nplaced is about their meaning and their \ncontext \nso if i take an example here \nthe coordinates are placed \n[Music] \nby means of their meaning so \nthat also means that the distance \nbetween different points \nare uh yeah mean how how close and how \nfar \nuh concepts in their meaning lie from \neach other \nand so in this example we have like \nfashion and sweater \nthose are really related in their \nmeaning but they are very far away \nfrom for example article and kovit 19. \nso as i said this is just an empty but \npre-trained language model so there's \nthere's no actual user data in there \nand so let's let's add a \ndata object how does that work \nand i have an example of article here \nso let's say we want to add an article \nto our database with the name \nthe impact of coronavirus on travel \nindustry which has maybe a certain \nsummary of more words \nit has links to authors and links to a \npublication \nwhat we they then does on import time is \nit takes all these concepts \nand makes yeah basically one large \nsentence or one large \nstring of it and then \nit does some calculations namely uh it \ncalculates how important each word is \nso you can imagine that for example the \nwords coronavirus and travel and \nindustry \nare more important they have more \nmeaning than the words has and in \nand um it calculates distances and then \ncomes with in the end one factor of 300 \ndimensions \nor three in our example and then it can \nbe placed \nin the vector space so \nif we just add an article about corona \nvirus and traveling \nmaybe it will place in the middle of \nthese three concepts \nand what then happens if you perform a \nsearch query \nis that the search query will also get \nindexed and placed in this vector space \nand then concepts and or data objects \nthat will be close to your search vector \nwill be returned first \nokay um i hope you're still with me \nafter this this demo and \nexplanation how it works so i will show \nyou now how to \nget started uh with vv8 if you want to \nuse it yourself \num i'm not showing this with a demo \nbecause we don't have all the time of \nthe world but i will \nquickly go through some documentation \nso if you are the documentation can be \nfound at semi.technology \ndocumentation and then \nthis is review so of course you can read \nall about \nreview at first but then we have pages \non getting started \nand on the quick start guide \nit basically explains everything you can \ndo \nso \ni will place the links in the chat later \nyes thanks \num sorry \nokay so um \nlet's see here \num so the quick start guide it explains \nyou how to \nhow to get started with docker compose \nand then \nmake a first schema make you add your \nfirst data and uh \ndo some first queries but this is all \nvery basic so \nif you want to add for example more of \nyour own data or want to have \na real vp running in the cloud or in \nyour own \nmachine you can go to the installation \npage \nand we basically have four different \nsetups \nso you can choose to use v8 with docker \ncompose \nand you can then run it locally or on \nthe cloud \nand we have a nice configuration tool \nalso to \nto retrieve the the right \nconfiguration file for for docker \ncompose and you can choose for example \nwhich \nlanguage model language you want to have \nin there \nthe second option is cloud deployment so \nvf8 is also available on google cloud \nmarketplace and you can find the details \nthere \nthen thirdly we have a refit cluster \nservice \nand this is if you want to have \nreviewed running in the cloud but you \ndon't have your own \ncloud instances available then you can \nrun it on \nour cloud services and you can try it \nout two weeks \nfor free and it's all explained in the \nconsole so you need to make an account \nin the console \nand then you can create a cluster here \nand then \nthe sandbox of two weeks is for free \nyou can enable disable authentication \nyou can even choose to have uh the demo \ndata center that just showed you \nalready in there and the language and \nthen you can create it \nand it will take like five minutes to to \nstart up this cluster before you can use \nit \nand then the last option is with \nkubernetes and that's really for \nlarge-scale production setups if you \nhave really big data sets \nand so this is not if you want to get \nstarted i think \nbut we have all the helm charts \navailable if you're interested \nand then um since vp8 is all \num yeah on api level let's say we have \nmade already three client libraries \nin go python and javascript and \ni'll just show you python now really \nquickly it's \navailable just via pip install \nand yeah you can \nuse it really easily in your python \nscripts to \ndo all the query operations and they are \nall explained in a restful api \ndocumentation and graphql documentation \nso for example in the graphql \ndocumentation this is one of the queries \ni just showed you \nso this is a simple query and then we \nalso have it \nuh you can see how this is done in \npython javascript go \nor old fashioned with girl \nso yeah that's that's how you basically \ncan get started using your own language \nas well \nand then we have different how-to guides \nif you \nwant to have more details on how to get \nstarted with specific topics \nand then how to contribute so this is \nthe main theme of this meetup of course \num \nso we're currently working towards the \nstandalone version vp8 is now \nstill dependent on elasticsearch as \na as a back-end graph sorry backhand \ndatabase but in a bit more than a month \nwe are moving to a standalone version \nso we're working hard on that but of \ncourse there are \nway more ways to contribute to the open \nsource vba \nand i basically split this up into two \nareas so we have \nuh first of all you can of course \ncontribute on code \ncode on github um on one of our projects \nand second is uh also just providing \nfeedback or ideas or \ntesting in in words on one of our \nchannels \nis of course also contributing on \nimproving deviate \nand so on \nso first contribute in code or github so \nwe have \nvarious open projects and um \ni'll just quickly show you where to find \nthis and how to get started so \nfirst one is we have on github \nuh on vvcore we have a issues with the \nlabel \ngood first issue so if you go to \nvivian's github i will share the link \nlater also \nand go to issues then \num you can filter with the label \nand you see um issues that are \nyeah good to start with that are like \nreally easy and low level to start with \ncurrently we have one that will be more \nin the future for sure \num \nsecond one is we want to have a \nreview java client at some point so \nas i just showed you in the \ndocumentation \nwe currently have three client libraries \nin gold python and javascript \nbut since v8 um is \nyeah on api level and we have heard from \nour users that also they want to run vva \nfrom their java script \nor yeah like draft java codes then um \nyeah there's currently no like real \nclient available and we want to make \nthis \navailable and like developing such a \njava client can be really \nlike rather straightforward because \nthey're like the \nthree clients that we have are really \ngood examples and \nin java it can be made with the same \ndesign in the same function structure \nbasically \nand so in our documentation we also have \ncontributors guide on the right side \num where you can also find information \non how to develop such a vivid client so \nwe have \ncertain guidelines for this um \nwhich functions it for example all needs \nto \nhave before it can be fully used for vpa \nso so that's an option \nthen we have are always looking for demo \ndata sets \nso as i said we have two demo data sets \navailable \nand running actually on cloud instances \nright now which you can \ndirectly use um but of course vv8 \nis a very generic solution to many many \nproblems and many use cases so we're \nalways looking for \nother data sets in other for example \nbusiness use cases \nand i can show an example here so we \nhave \ni've made a while ago a demo on archive \nscientific papers so that's like a data \nset of 1.7 million \nscientific papers and i made some \nscripts to \npull the data from internet \nand then make a schema and then uh \nimport it to deviate \nand make test queries and how i set it \nup \nalso with like continuous integration \nand so on is all uh open on github as \nwell of course so \nif you want to use viviate for your own \nproject \nyour own data set you can look at this \nexample \non how to get started with this \nand of course we are always open to \ncollaborate with forming finding forming \nnew data sets \nand running it on cloud instances for \ntesting and so on \nthen fourth is software testing so of \ncourse since it's a software project we \ndo a lot of testing \nand this becomes even more important now \nthat our \nlike core v8 but also all the other \ngithub repositories are growing but also \nour user base is growing \nit's super important and then besides \nthe usual uh like functional testing \nlike \nunit testing and integration testing we \nalso want to do \nuh usability testing or scalability \ntesting for example \nand these are all cases that we uh do \nourselves of course \nas well but if you want to test out on \nyour own data set \nor with a diff with \nyourself as user with other users that's \nof course \nsuper great and super important to \nimprove \nwith y8 \nand then lastly \nwe have quite extensive documentation \nand as most of you are \nnew to to review and you will \nprobably use the documentation a lot to \nto get started \nand and to use specific \napi functions and so on and any kind of \nfeedback on this is really important for \nus \num and for vvate because of course \nhow the users start using it \ndetermines on how effie it will actually \nbe used \nin their projects later uh so \nany kind of feedback is welcome not only \num \nthings that can be improved but maybe \nalso things that you find really helpful \nso we can improve that \nand then yeah as i just showed you \nquickly already \num we have a contributors guide on uh \non the documentation so it's over here \nand in the contributors guide you can \nfind \nall information on how we develop \nsoftware and \nwhat the philosophy is behind vv8 and \nbehind \ndeveloping for vp8 um \nand also how to build run and test the \ncode for example \nand as you can see here how to set up \nyour local \nenvironment to get started developing \nfor vva \nand then as i said some guidelines on \nmaking \nclients but also we have benchmarks on \nsome tests that we do \non the language model it can all be \nfound here \nall right then uh secondly um \nyou can contribute to improving vvate by \nuh just giving feedback in one of our \nchannels \nso uh yeah as i said \nplease just try out v8 uh uh \nsee what what you can do with it and \nthen you can \nbring your own use case on open or close \ndata \nof course if it's open data that's super \ngreat because that means you can \nalso share it with other community \nmembers \num and also on \none of our channels but of course you \ncan use vva for \nfor closed data as well um \nyeah as i said all ideas are welcome so \nyou can think of \nuh also new features or features that \nyou think are missing and \nand post a question on as an issue on \ngithub \nor on stack overflow or on slack or on \none of our other social media channels \nbecause we \nread them all and we have active \ncommunity community members on them all \nso that's great \num yeah so that's what i wanted to share \nyou about \nvv8 and how to contribute today \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Contributors Meetup #1", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gd5Fx0fOdfA", "timestamp": "", "reader":
