{"text": "Thank you so much for watching the 26th episode of the Weaviate Podcast! This is another really special episode! Jonathan ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nchecking out the weave podcast I'm super \nexcited to welcome Jonathan Franco back \nto the weba podcast Jonathan is one of \nthe co-founders of Mosaic ml a company \nthat is just doing amazing work in the \nspace of making deep learning training \nmore efficient faster cheaper and \nthey've recently produced an estimate of \ncosts for language GPT language model \nlanguage model costs across all these \ndifferent sizes and price points and \njust overall helping people get a better \nunderstanding of what it takes to have \nyour own large language model and I've \nbeen so interested in large language \nmodels and thinking particularly with \nweave and the role that they might have \nin search so I'm so excited to welcome \nJonathan back to the podcast and talk \nabout what he's been up to at mosaic ml \nthank you so much for having me it's \nalways a pleasure to get to talk to you \nand I can't wait to talk about this new \nproject \nawesome so yeah could we dive right into \nit um so what what's the latest update \nwith um the Mosaic ml cloud and training \nlarge language models \ndefinitely so you know just to give you \na sense of what we do at mosaic very \nbriefly you know our goal is to train \nmodels efficiently just in general \nthat's you know that's what we want to \ndo for everybody and there are a lot of \nways of making it possible to train a \nmodel efficiently and obviously a lot of \nmodels that people want to train \nefficiently so I think the last time we \nchatted we had just released composer \nwhich is our our open source library \nwith all of our efficiency methods built \nin and I think we had shortly thereafter \nreleased our recipe where we gotten like \na 7x speed up in training resonate 50 on \nimagenet over the standard Nvidia \nbaselines which you know I'm kind of \njealous I'm not seeing a bunch of people \ndoing lottery ticket experiments I \nhumanly couldn't do because it was \ntaking too long to train and now people \nare able to do it overnight and I'm \nsuper jealous that people get to do that \nwork now \num but our latest release is for large \nlanguage models for GPT 3 Type models \nspecifically and you know it's been a \nlot of work on our part but we've put \ntogether our own software stack for \ntraining these models we've put together \nunderneath that in the orchestration \nstack which is part of our Mosaic Cloud \nthat I'm sure we'll talk about a little \nbit and the end result is we put out \nsome price you want to train gpt3 today \nyou know you can call me today it's 450 \n000 to get to gpt3 Quality \num we can talk more about where that \nnumber comes from and how it compares to \nother numbers but I'll tell everyone \nthat's the starting point \num you know that's the Baseline to beat \nand first of all if you beat that \nBaseline let me know we'd love to you \nknow obviously make it better but second \nof all our goal at mosaic is going to be \nto drive that cost down as close to zero \nas possible over the next while I've set \nthe goal informally to the team of \ngetting to 100K sometime the next few \nmonths I think it's eminently possible \ngiven the kinds of speedups we've gotten \nelsewhere \nwell so can we get into this stack uh \nsee things like the uh distributed data \nparallelism uh the chinchilla the \noptimal compute laws uh kind of like \nwhat goes into the package of uh the \nlanguage model training yeah so they're \nreally \nthree big ingredients \num I mean the first ingredient to be \ncompletely honest is we put a number out \nthere this is kind of ingredient zero I \nthink a lot of the numbers you've seen \npreviously for gpt3 have just been \noverblown to be completely Frank I think \nour number looks very impressive based \non the insane estimate some people have \nput out but those estimates just don't \nhave really any basis in reality \num you know this is a good number but \nit's it's an honest number and I think \nanybody else who sat down and tried to \ndo this today would get to the same \nnumber \nso you know item zero is just trying to \nbe as direct and clear and honest as \npossible with the numbers \num you don't want to scare anybody off \nfrom trying this quick to the contrary I \nthink everybody should be training their \nown models here there's no reason why \nyou should rent the model when you can \nbuy it \num but you know there are really three \nbig technical ingredients that go into \nthis I think the first is the chinchilla \nscaling laws so for those who aren't \nfamiliar you know first of all we have \nthese neural network scaling laws which \nare kind of \nI feel like scaling law is a very strong \nword these are our beliefs about the \nright amount of compute to use to train \non a certain amount of data in order to \nget a model that you know is the best \npossible model that you could get there \nif you have a or you know if you look at \na different way if you have a certain \nbudget of compute \nhow should you spend it how much data do \nyou need to really make the most of that \ncompute in order to get the best \npossible language model what \narchitecture should you even train \num there's nothing fundamental or \nnatural about this this is probably a \nhuman description of a phenomenon that \nmay be more sophisticated and more \ncomplicated and I could talk your hair \noff about you know how much we should \ntrust scaling loss this is to be fair \none of the only places in deep learning \nwhere we have a scaling law on this GPT \nstyle language modeling you'd never hear \nabout scaling loss for Bert for example \num so you know we this may not work \neverywhere but at least here we can kind \nof make these guesses and what happened \nwas a couple years ago the folks at \nopenai um Jared Kaplan and collaborators \ncame out with a paper proposing some \nscaling laws and it was awesome it you \nknow it was the basis for predictions \nabout what size gpt3 should be the \nproblem was actually that it was a \nlittle bit off \num and as soon as you extrapolate to \nbigger and bigger models and this is you \nknow keep in mind we're dealing with you \nsee these nice linear plots of scale on \na log log axis so being off by a little \nis being off by a ton \nand so especially at these larger scales \nlike gbt3 \nwe the predictions just weren't you know \nweren't as accurate as they could be \nwhich is totally expected when you're \ntraining on small models and trying to \nextrapolate if you're off by a little \nyou're off by a lot and the folks at \ndeepmind went through and basically fit \nthe scaling well a little bit better and \nfit it with more data with more compute \nI mean years later so they had many more \nresources it's no flaw at the Kaplan \nwork it's really just you know it's like \nwe developed the James Webb Telescope \nand now we can observe Stars better than \nwe could with the Hubble telescope \nand what they found was that for the \namount of data gpt3 was trained on \nthe model was way too big \nit just didn't have to be 175 billion \nparameters it could have been closer to \n33 billion \nand that dramatically reduces the cost \nof doing this \nit's a huge difference because the cost \nincreases quadratically as you get to \nthese bigger models because bigger \nmodels you need more data as well and so \nyou know you can get away with doing \nthis much cheaper that way \nso that's why the um in the cloud I \nthink it's like 60 billion parameters is \nthe 450 000 mark because 60 billion is \njust as good as the 175 billion in terms \nof performance and that kind of thing \nit's actually 30 billion which is to me \nkind of mind-blowing like we're dropping \nthe size by you know to 20 of what it \nwas before like when it comes to \nefficiency that's about as good as it \ngets so you know I don't think that's \nthe end of the story though to be \ncompletely Frank \nwe're seeing so so much interesting work \non data pruning and curricula and you \nknow questions of whether we you know \nhow we should change what the attention \noperation looks like in the paper we saw \nthis interesting parallel attention that \ncame out we've got flash attention like \nthere's just so many new ideas floating \nin the space now about how to train \nthese models effectively that you know \nwe got 5x from just measuring something \na little bit better \nhow many other five X's are there \nso there's probably a lot more here \nBeyond this but you know for anyone \nwho's doing research right now and \nreally wants to get into this stuff I \nthink the sky's the limit on making \nthese large language models more \nefficient this was just kind of the low \nhanging fruit \nthat's super interesting can we dive \ninto what makes it more efficient \nobviously you're the king of sparsity \nwith the lottery ticket hypothesis and \nyou know there's things like sparse \nattention uh I learned about say the Ali \nB attention when I was first going \nthrough composer uh what are the you \nknow efficiency things that have gone \ninto the uh gbt3 training from Mosaic um \nnothing \nthat's the honest answer is that we're \nusing flash attention \num from our colleagues at Stanford but \notherwise \nwe haven't even put in our speed up \nmethods yet this is I mentioned before \nthis is our Baseline \nthis is you know this is resnet 50 from \nthe Nvidia examples this is the way that \nI think about it this is the starting \npoint for making things more efficient \nthe first thing you have to do is stand \nup the stack and compute what your \nBaseline costs and the answer is \nwow the Baseline is already a lot \ncheaper than we thought thanks to the \nthe work of the chinchilla folks and \nsome other things we'll mention \num but this is just our starting point \nat mosaic and I expect you'll see in a \nfew months from us that number dropped \nprecipitously \num and keep in mind this is the number \nthat allows us to you know have a \nhealthy business as well \num so there's a lot of room for us to \nkeep pushing down that number \nwell and uh so I read another quote in \nthe article around something around um \nthe vision of training millions millions \nof models compared to say the zero shot \ngeneralization kind of way of thinking \nuh can you tell me more about your \nvision for uh customized models say it's \nlike you know biomedical domain \nFinancial domain legal domain uh do you \nsee that being like how has your \nexperience with Mosaic been on finding \nall these specific use cases and then \nhelping people say uh you know convince \nthem what a language model is why it's \nworth it and then how to say prepare \ntheir data like what's that experience \nbeen of getting people to train their \nown language model \ndefinitely so I think this is and this \nis honestly something on the wavy side \nI'd like to chat about as well \num people have a lot of data and you \nknow that sounds like a dumb thing to \nsay but honestly there wouldn't be \nweeviate if people didn't have a lot of \ndata that they need to organize in some \nway and I think you can it's the same \nargument at mosaic that I've yet to meet \na potential customer who wasn't sitting \non a treasure Trove of unlabeled data in \ntheir particular domain \nand the question is really well \nshouldn't you be able to take advantage \nof that or to put it a different way \nright now we're asking or GPT to do \ntransfer learning essentially we take \nbirth we pre-train it on you know Google \nBooks and we pre-trained it on C4 and \nthen the hope is well you fine-tune it \non your data and then it'll transfer \nwhy should we even bother to transfer \nlike don't you want to pre-train your \nmodel on in domain data you may not have \nit labeled but one big hypothesis we \nhave in Mosaic and we're seeing this \nborne out in practice with customers \nright now is that you should pre-train \non your own data and in fact \npre-training on your own data \nmakes it much easier to get better \nperformance because you're in domain \nyou don't have to force the model to go \nacross domains and across tasks \nso it sounds very obvious like why do \ntransfer learning if we don't have to \nbut I think in the academic literature \nwe think of burnt we think it burnt two \nways one is you know what do you do with \nall this unlabeled data you have but the \nother is that we somehow put the \nconstraint on ourselves that Burke has \nto be generic \nthat you want to have given that it's so \nexpensive to free train your own bird we \nhave to make a birth that anyone can use \nfor anything \num \nwe're successful at mosaic and we push \ndown the cost of Bert pre-training to \nthe point where it's not expensive and \nI'll argue to you it's actually not very \nexpensive I think we've pushed down the \ncost of pre-training to the point where \nit costs what image training used to \ncost so for those academics out there \nwho want to train on purp I think it's \ntoo expensive it's not you know reach \nout we haven't released a recipe yet but \nyou should expect that next month for \nbirth \nbut you know you don't need a generic \nbird if you want to build a bird for \nyour one Downstream task or your two \nDownstream tasks and in that case you \nreally do want a free train on your own \ndata in fact you want to do even more \nthan that you want a tokenizer that was \nbuilt using your data set because you \nknow the tokens that were used for C4 \nare on Reddit or for Twitter or you know \nthey have lots of emojis they have lots \nof words or characters they may not show \nup in your data you may have characters \nfrom a language that isn't included in \nyour data that are wasting your \nvocabulary \nand so everything's in the tokenizer \nit's what you pre-train on you can build \na domain specific or domain-specific TPT \nand I think that's pretty exciting like \nif you have medical data you don't want \na model that's pre-trained on Reddit as \nyour basis you I don't think you want to \nuse an API where you're just wearing a \nmodel that was pre-trained on Reddit \nwhat kind of medical data are you \ngetting \num why not free train on PubMed \num if you're working in a legal context \nagain do you want legal advice from \nReddit or do you want legal advice from \nwhatever internal data you said you have \nor from the actual laws from various \ncountries if you've downloaded those \nlaws for some reason in a particular \ndomain so I think over and over and over \nagain or you know even further field if \nyou're working on code or proteins \nyou probably don't want to start with C4 \nit probably makes a lot more sense to \nstart on GitHub \nyeah that's super interesting and I \nthought I thought a lot about in search \nhow you know a lot of the the bm25 the \nkeyword scoring is so popular because it \nhelps for those specific words as say uh \nyou know say you're training it on \nMosaic ml slack and you want a language \nmodel to talk to you about Mosaic ml you \nknow the word composer has never been \nseen in Wikipedia so then these keyword \nscoring can help you adapt to that \ncompared to this but um so kind of in my \nthinking around language models and \nlarge models I guess the reason I always \nthought that Reddit and Wikipedia were \nso popular is because it's it like helps \nthe overfitting sort of with you know a \nbillion parameter model is predicting \nthe mass token if you only have uh you \nknow 300 paragraphs I always thought it \nwould overfit to that is that kind of \nlike the regularization techniques help \novercome that or what you're thinking \naround oh I think this all comes down to \ndata volume \nso the assumption is made that people \ndon't have enough data \npeople have tons of data oh my god like \npeople have hundreds of billions of \ntokens of language data on their domain \ninternally \nthink of a company that runs like a I \ndon't know a chat service for customer \nservice agents or something like that \ncan you imagine how much in-domain data \nthey have \num everybody has tons of data it's been \nshocking to me how much data is floating \naround so I think the important part to \nrecognize is like C4s around a trillion \ntokens \nbut plenty of people have around a \ntrillion tokens of data or more the \namount of data that I've heard people \nhave it's just like it's astounding how \nmuch unlabeled data labeling labeling is \nexpensive you want to do it as best you \ncan you need it for the downstream tasks \nbut how do you leverage all that other \nunlabeled data \ntraining gpt3 train a bird train you \nknow a Sinclair model on your data and \nuse that as your starting point not an \nimagenet pre-trained SIM clear not a you \nknow a C4 pre-trained GPT \nlike I think \nwe have plenty of in domain data it may \nnot be in the public sphere if you \nwanted to go and find a data set of 200 \nbillion tokens of legal data that's hard \nbut a company that specializes in doing \nlegal work probably has that in spades \nyeah that's incredible and I and like \nthe language modeling algorithm is such \na beautiful self-supervised you know \npredict the master token it's very easy \nto just drop your text in and I think a \nlot of and you know simclear also with \nyou have images you can just augment the \nimages and then positive pair and then \nwe have some good heuristics I was \nrecently looking at this uh paper called \nspider from Ori ROM and we had him on \nthe podcast a way to similarly do the \npositive negative bootstrapping uh kind \nof one other thing I was curious about \nwith these laws like say the argument \nfor Wikipedia for Reddit is the \npre-training corpuses I always kind of \nthought like this prompting uh like the \nway that you can sort of template the \ninput was a result of it of it's seeing \nthis kind of thing on the internet so \nlike you know it's because it's modeling \nHTML \nif you do like image source equals or \nlike I don't know how you prompted but \nlike like prompting it with like you \nknow how they'll like do like the title \nfor an article by having title HTML tags \nand then that's where it generates so \nmaybe do you have any thoughts about \nkind of prompting and how that might be \ndifferent when you're doing it for a \nspecific data set \ndefinitely I think it again comes down \nto transfer learning in some sense \nprompting is not transfer learning \nyou're training the model to make \npredictions on what comes next for \nspecific tasks or in this case you know \na lot of different things and then \nprompting is just asking it to do more \nof that \num if you want to prompt your model for \nsomething that is like what's in your \ndata set if you're you know \ndoing medical work and you have a data \nset of medical facts and you want to \nprompt it for medical diagnosis \ninformation if it's in domain it's in \ndomain and so you don't need to \nyou know you don't really need to worry \nabout that \num and I think you know the happy medium \nmay eventually be a mix \none of the things we're doing a lot of \nplaying with right now is mixing you \nknow open source data Plus customer data \nand seeing whether like what the Right \nMix is should you like amplify the \ncustomer data more to kind of balance \nout what's happening but you know maybe \nit is good to have a little bit of \nopen-endedness like you know if you have \na medical data set it's not going to be \nable to write your HTML for you you're \ncompletely right like that I would be \nshocked if that happens here in a \nmedical context maybe you don't care \nmaybe you care a little bit about the \nmodel's ability to just kind of \ngeneralize a little bit and then it's a \nmatter of mixing the data properly or \ndoing the pre-training at a specific \norder I think these are things that like \nthere's paper don't stop pre-training \nthat like looks at this a little bit but \nI don't know if we have the tools in \nAcademia right now to really look at \nthis closely maybe something like the \npile which does have a bunch of separate \ndomains would give us some ability but \nI'm not even sure we know how to measure \nsuccess like measuring crafting is hard \nand I you know their their harnesses out \nthere there are benchmarks out there but \nI don't know how good they are right now \nso we're kind of in this tricky place \nwhere \nI'm not entirely sure \nhow we measure and how we make progress \nin this front scientific we need the \nbenchmarks \nand you know this is kind of a call to \naction for the academic world and people \nwho may be listening this is a great \nproject to do you don't need to have a \nmillion dollars in compute in fact you \ndon't need to have any compute in order \nto play around with a little bit of \nprompting on different kinds of data \nsets and building benchmarks \num I you you mentioned one point that I \nthought was incredibly interesting this \nidea of mixing open source data with \nin-domain data \num can you tell me a little more about \nthe approach that maybe you would use \nyour in domain data as a query and then \nget like the top 10 nearest Neighbors \nFrom the pile and then you know then \nblow it up 10x with that kind of \nthinking what's been that kind of \nstrategy maybe I mean as a scientist in \nme my reaction is always what's the \ndumbest thing you can do first \nfor me the dumbest thing is I don't know \nyou've got 100 million tokens if you're \na Dano we've got C4 \num C4 is a trillion token so if we were \nto just sample from both the data sets \ncombined your data would be \nunderrepresented let's you know over \nsample your data by 5 or 10x and kind of \nmake it 50 50. that would be the dumb \nfirst thing I'd try and the other thing \nyou could try is doing stage free \ntraining like pre-train on C4 for a \nwhile and then free train on your data I \ndon't know if catastrophic forgetting \nwould kick in this is all new science \num again for any people listening who \nare trying to write a paper right now \nthere's so many questions oh my God I \nwish I were an Academia at the moment to \nchase after these questions there's so \nmuch great science to do \num but then you can get into questions \nof like how do you figure out similarity \nbetween things this is where honestly \nhaving some kind of if only there were a \nservice that would let you find the \nsimilarity between different kinds of \nobjects in a semantic way \num you know figuring out what that \nsimilarity is and being able to use it \nso it's we have so many tools at our \ndisposal right now there are a lot of \nopportunities for us to to play around \nwith these things and really the living \nlimiting factor there does become cost \nbut you'll probably see a lot of the \nsame effects in small scale that you \nwill in large scale so you can study \nthis at 100 million parameters and then \ntest it at 100 billion parameters and \nsee what happens \nsuper cool and um so I want to kind of \nget into the applications of large \nlanguage models I think uh so like kind \nof transfer learning for some other task \nis a very popular one say few shot \nlearning and then you've recently \ntouched on a really interesting idea \nwhich is language models as databases \nyou you know query the language model \ndirectly you can tell me more about your \nthoughts on that idea yeah I think this \nis kind of \nI I don't think it's too early to call \nit an emerging consensus but I would \ncall it an emerging zeitgeist \nthat these language models are really \nkind of shims or interfaces you can kind \nof honestly look at it two ways language \nmodels are databases in and of \nthemselves you can query a language \nmodel for the facts that it has \ncontained in it um you know who was the \nfirst president of the United States \nlike you know the language model we'll \nsay that George Washington maybe you \nneed to prompt it a little bit with \nexamples of how to take question and \nreceive answer you've seen all this work \non Chain of Thought kind of same idea \nlike how do you get information out of \nthe model how do you make the model do \nmath \nin some sense this is all about the \nmodel having information that it's \nfiguring out how to relate or connect in \ninteresting emergent fuzzy ways that \nwouldn't have been possible in a \nrelational database the other way is to \nhave the model literally interface with \ndata or with some kind of data source \nand I mean it's an example of that in \nthat sense my other favorite example is \nthe folks in Adept AI who are building \nmodels that know how to interface with \nvarious web sources \num you saw this paper from a few oppress \nrecently where he had a language model \nset up such that you know it would ask a \nquestion it would try to deduce some \ninformation by asking question you know \nit would provide a question and then you \nknow it would either provide the answer \nitself or a fear to this cool thing \nwhere he would just call out to Google \nand put on the answer from Google and \nthen have it ask follow-up question and \nthen you know just keep using that \ninformation but it was queering to \nGoogle \nit was using a data source and then I \nthink there was an example I saw on \nTwitter today of having a model like \nwrite IPython \nqueries that would use the Wikipedia \npackage to query Wikipedia for \ninformation and then use that as input \nso we're getting to this really \ninteresting place where the model itself \nknows things and the model can interact \nwith data sources in and of itself I \nthink these are really two separate \nthings and I do Wonder from the future \nwe'll train them differently maybe this \nis what the folks at Adept are already \ndoing but if you want the model to do \nretrieval and interact with data sources \nyou'll train it completely differently \nfrom how you train it if you want it to \nknow things in and of itself \nbut I do wonder whether one cool \napplication may be \nlet's suppose you have a big sequel \nrelational database \nyou just train a language model on that \ncontent \nand have that alongside the database and \nyou know develop ways to query that \nmodel for kinds of relationships or \nkinds of information that are in your \ndatabase but that you might not be able \nto suss out from just relations or \nwriting SQL queries it'll find new \nrelations I mean this is what wevia is \nin some sense and in many ways this is \nturbocharging it by literally training \nthe model with the data \nin addition to that so I think the \napplications are endless in that respect \nI really want to go back to self ask and \nI you know seeing your endorsement for \nthe paper and then I checked it out and \nI just thought it was amazing and but I \ndo I want to stand this idea a little \nmore so is this the idea of say you you \nknow you you take tabular data and you \ntranslate it into text like just by kind \nof parsing it like I read this paper \ncalled language interface fine tuning \nwhere it's like you know if and then the \nfeature name equals the feature value \nlike you have this template to parse \ntabular into text is that kind of what \nthe thinking of maybe we move all our \ndata into this text interface for the \nlanguage models yeah I mean that would \nbe again you you know me I only do dumb \nthings \num that would be the first dumb thing I \ntried what if you just literally take \nthe row of the database \nformat it basically treat it as a \nsentence like put a little symbol \nbetween each of the items in the \ndatabase maybe give it the field name \nlike put it into a little record format \nand then those are the sentences you \ntrain the language model on I wonder \nwhat would happen \nI wonder if that would be enough given a \nsufficient amount of data for you to be \nable to query the model maybe you do \nneed to pre-train it first on something \nthat looks like C4 \nand then you train this but really the \nquestion is just how do you shelve the \ndata into the model \nand at that point maybe a new relations \nshow up \nmaybe the model has some preconceived \nnotions if you pre-trained it on C4 \num but really at the end of the day the \nquestion becomes in my mind don't you \nwant your data and your database in some \nsense \nI also wonder whether you could have a \nlanguage model that learns to do SQL \nqueries on a database to extract data \nout of that the same way we're doing \nwith Google or Wikipedia right now you \ncould kind of go either way but the \nimportant part is allowing the model to \nfind these new emergent soft \nrelationships between data like you know \nI'm totally convinced now of the \nweeviate mission in that sense like this \nis \nyou know there's so much we can unlock \nfrom our data that we couldn't before by \njust letting the model figure out how \nthings are connected in ways that are \nhard for us to write down \nyeah it's super interesting and um so \nwith this idea of things that are hard \nto write down I want to come back to the \nself-ask thing and um Chain of Thought \nprompting and you know this general idea \nof language models with tool use I've \nseen that phrase like tool you set I \nthink that's a pretty nice one uh where \nit's like say the language model uh \nqueries a calculator or it writes some \ncode and then it runs the code and says \nokay what's the output from that and and \nwith these search engines I think is \njust incredibly interesting because we \nhave all this kind of like search \npipeline stuff and query formulation \nthings where you might be like uh \ntemperature in Germany and then you \nquery it and then you get the results \nback and you're like oh actually I meant \nthis particular City or like you or \naverage like you add keywords as you \nkind of iteratively search oh so where \ndoes this self-ask thing this Chain of \nThought is it in the training data is it \nsomething that is maybe learned from the \nlanguage how has it learned to be like \nyou know have a prompt that breaks up \nthe question into like the compositional \nfacts and then how how does it learn to \ndo that \nthat's a great question honestly you \nshould invite ophir to chat about that \nand I I it's a great question I hadn't \nthought of it that way \nI don't know where it is in the data and \nit may simply be that the model is \nmashing up all this other data that it \nhas in an interesting way the same way \nthat you can get stable diffusion to \ngive you like people sitting around a \ncampfire on an airplane I think I saw go \nby or like salmon swimming in a stream \nwhere it was literal pieces of salmon \nlike \nyou know that was never anywhere in the \ntraining except but it managed to mash \nit up and figure out what to do with it \nand I wonder if something similar is \nhappening here I what I what I love \nabout all this work like self-ask \num Chain of Thought \nwe are developing new querying languages \nthis is like us inventing SQL except \nthat we didn't design the database the \ndatabase came into being and we have to \nfigure out how to interact with it that \nexample I mentioned about the IPython \ninteraction like that's a again it's a \nnew querying language and I honestly \nthought the most potent part of the \nself-ask wasn't even necessarily the \nself-ask part \nit was that ophir did such a phenomenal \njob figuring out a way to measure the \ncomplexity of the knowledge that was \nextracted from the model \nhe gave us a benchmark a ladder to climb \na way to measure whether we could \nretrieve certain kinds of information \nfrom models and I think that's going to \nopen the door to a ton more benchmarks \nand you know what happens when there's a \nbenchmark \num we optimize the hell out of that \nBenchmark to edit coach science forward \nwe develop new querying methods I don't \nlove the idea that we'll go through and \nmanually come up with these querying \nmethods because that just to me seems a \nlittle unscientific in some sense maybe \nit's good enough \num maybe some of this prompt tuning \nstuff will give us ways to discover \nbetter prompts or something like that \nit's still pretty early \nbut you know we've raised really two or \nthree huge questions here \none is you know how do you get the \nknowledge into the model \nor where does the knowledge come from or \neven is the knowledge in the model or \ndoes the model just know how to interact \nwith data sources \nnumber two is how do we query the model \nnumber three is how do we measure the \nefficacy of that query like in SQL you \nknow if you got the right answer like \nyou can go through and manually search \nthe database or what have you do you \nknow if there's a bug in your like \ndatabase compiler here \nhow do we know how to measure what the \nmodel knows is there a world in which \nactually The Innovation that allows us \nto dramatically reduce the cost isn't \na bigger model or a better training \nalgorithm but a better querying language \nthat allows us to find that actually \ngpt2 had all the same knowledge or it \ncould do much of the things that we can \ndo today with gpt3 we just didn't know \nhow to ask it for it we didn't know how \nto get it out of the model \nI don't know that I like that makes me \ndream I kind of wonder if a billion \nparameters may be enough in two years \nbecause we'll get better at the querying \npart but to do that we need better \nknowledge measurement and if I were a \ngrad student right now \nthose would be all the cool questions \nI'd want to work on because you don't \nneed a huge model to do it \nlike oh sure told me he used 900 worth \nof compute on that entire paper \nwhich is just insane given that I have \ngraphs that are 10 times worse that's \nnot in some of my papers \nyeah well that um so fear came up with \nthis like compositional celebrities \nBenchmark where \num in the it's like um \nuh who I think it's things like who was \npresident the year that Justin Bieber \nwas born uh so you you chained together \nthese facts and then it does that uh \nmulti-hop compositional question and uh \nJonathan we brought up the um the uh I \nthink it's salmon swimming up a river \nand um it's a diffusion picture and and \nit's like literally like uh literally \nbut it's like the food is like in a \nriver it makes no sense and I'm sure \nthat future without the training set and \npeople have pushed it enough it's not \njust memorizing \nlaughs \nbut uh so I'm very curious about this \nlike compositional generalization I \nthink like the Gary Marcus angle is it's \nlike um uh a cup of coffee with holes in \nit it shouldn't be able to exist right \nis because the coffee would come out of \nthe cup or uh the ball on top of the the \nlike you chained together all those \nadjectives like a round green rectangle \non top of uh uh purple cylinder what do \nyou think about this compositional \ngeneralization is is this like kind of \nthe ultimate generalization test \nI don't know I try to stay away from the \nGary Marcus conversation to be \ncompletely honest \num you know you can listen to old people \ntalk a lot if you want to or you can do \nreal science \num that's all I'll say about Gary Marcus \nright now on Twitter \num but I do think it's an interesting \nquestion as to what kind of \ncompositionality we want \num you know \nwhen it comes to video \nyou could get this kind of behavior I \nthink really you know what may be \nmissing is that we're working on \npictures and not on video then when you \nsee video you may say well there are \nstill things that can't really figure \nout \num okay fine you know we need to move to \nsome kind of better World model so it's \nreally \nI think the question of like the coffee \ncup with holes in it is a little bit \nseparate from the answer of kind of \ncompositional reasoning \non the compositional reasoning side I \nmean I think ophir may have pushed these \nkind of compositional questions to their \nlimit like once you get into three part \nquestions like \nwho was president in the year that the \nperson who wrote blah blah song was born \num like when you get to the third and \nfourth order questions it just gets like \nhumans wouldn't be able to answer those \nquestions \nso I think ophir has shown us a way \nforward and there's going to need to be \nmore Innovation on how we measure the \nkind of knowledge that's in these models \nhow we find other things that require \nlogic to work their way through or it \nreally it is a throwback to some of the \n1970s and 1980s style AI where we might \nneed these giant knowledge bases where \nwe can come up with facts that we or \ndeductions that we know to be true based \non these you know these expert system \nsorts of databases \nand then you don't need to ask the model \nto try to reason through and figure \nthose same things out deductively \nand I don't know I think that's a really \ncool world to live in and a fierce paper \nlike it points the way toward a future \nno we have benchmarks that look like \nthat where ophir doesn't have to \nmanually generate those questions but we \nhave you know maybe we dust off some \nscheme from the 1970s and \nthat may already be there for us to pull \non \nyeah well I that kind of thinking about \nhow we do this like aggregate query in \nthese language model databases very \ninteresting like if we have a collection \nof articles about hiking trails in you \nknow New England let's say and then we \nwant to ask how many hiking trails are \nin New Hampshire and then it needs to \nhave that kind of intermediate and the \nlanguage model is the interface of the \naggregation that there's this other \npaper called like neural databases is \nsomething that had like this um you know \na symbolic aggregate step explicitly set \nand I think all that is just incredibly \ninteresting um I wanted to also ask you \nabout a kind of different way of \nthinking about language models the \nretrieval augmented language models and \nyou know like the whole idea of uh you \nhave the you retrieve something and then \nyou maybe it's like an encoder decoder \nwhere what you retrieve is you know \nfusion and decoder style rather than \njust being say prepended to the input \nand then you know decoder only gbt um do \nyou have any thoughts about things like \nyou know rag Atlas these kind of models \na retro yeah I like \nI love where we are in the field right \nnow \num we have models that we can train to \nmemorize data we have models that can \nuse you know we have retrieval augmented \nmodels we have the ability to fine-tune \nmodels we already have we can prompt \nmodels we can do in context learning we \ncan have the models use external tools \nwe're and we can actually literally \ntrain the models to use the external \ntools or we can prompt them to use the \nexternal tools \nprobably one or two of these are going \nto stand the test of time \nI have no idea which and I love it \nI absolutely love it right now like this \nis this must have been how it felt in \nlike 2015 for those of us the 99 of us \nwho aren't in this field in 2015 when \nVision models were just exploding and \nevery week it was like a whole different \nway of doing things Fiji resnet \nInception these were all such different \nmodels that were trained in such \ndifferent ways Adam was floating around \nat that time in different optimization \nstrategies Bachelor and pops up layer \nNorm pops up it's just this whole sea of \nideas and it was hard to know what the \nbest thing would be dancing at wide \ndress net like it was just and here we \nhave even more diversity and just \ncompletely different paradigms for \ninteracting with these models \nit is a great time to be in the field \nlike I don't know people keep \ncomplaining like all the cool stuff was \ndone \nthis is the cool stuff \nlike this is why I'm here because we \nhave no idea what the right answer is \nand there's so much science to do and \nfor the people who sit down and \nsystematically develop ways to measure \nthis and systematically develop real \nworld scenarios and honestly that's a \nlot of our work at mosaic unfortunately \nit uses a lot of customer data \num because and we can't release that \ndata \num although we try to find ways to share \nthe findings and we can reproduce it on \npublic data sets but \nyou know what a time to be in this field \nso much happening \nyeah how much um like how much of this \ndo you think is from the Transformer and \njust text as being sort of the interface \nwith multimodal domains I feel like a \nlot of the well I mean yeah there's a \nlot of breakthroughs to look at but like \nI feel like the sort of text and NLP to \nme seems like sort of maybe the biggest \nI mean um images of course but I think \nlike this text interface is just such a \nunifying way of doing it and then also \nfor creating user interfaces for uh \npeople to interact with these things uh \nso many pivoting topics um I heard you \nknow bachelor normalization later \nnormalization um can you tell me about \nthe state of uh composer and all these \nregularizations I'm so curious about you \nknow the training recipes and making it \neasier to train models \nyeah so I'll walk you through a bunch of \nthings so Mosaic the way that we think \nabout this is at the end of the day we \nhave kind of converged around four or \nfive big models so much A lot's built \num you know those are things like resnet \nwhich is not only for image \nclassification more academic but also as \nthe backbone for a lot of object \ndetection segmentation models that are \nused in practice today you know we talk \na lot about the big Vision Transformers \nand everything but by and large when \nwe've seen you know good old dressnet is \nstill the old standby \nthen you have you know your segmentation \nyour object detection models we've again \nconverged around a few different heads \nfor doing segmentation for doing object \ndetection so we're kind of you know \nthere are a few different pipelines NLP \nyou know it's Burton GPT that's the show \nyou know there are other sorts of things \nkicking around there is retro you know \nkind of a tweak on TPT there's you know \nthings like \num \nshe was completely slipping my mind \num but you know there are a bunch of \nother paradigms out there by and large \nit's broken GPT that run the show \num and at the end of the day those \nstandbys really are what works at mosaic \na lot of them are focusing on the \nscientific side is developing really \ngreat recipes for training those models \nso you know we released our recipe back \nin June that was our proof of concept to \nbasically convince ourselves it would be \npossible to speed up models this way and \nwe got a 700 speed up over the Nvidia \nbench bass lines which I'm so proud of \nto be fair it's an old Benchmark um but \neven over some of the newer stuff like \nthe Tim models we still were looking at \na 2x or 3x Improvement and accuracy \nlevels that had never been achieved on \npress that 50 on image that without help \nfrom outside data sets \nso we're really proud of that and you \nknow we're doing it for everything so \nhonestly I'll just you know I'll go \nahead and spoil it for everybody we're \ngoing to be releasing our segmentation \nmodel next week I believe that we're \nlooking at the team has told me anywhere \nbetween a 5 and a 20x speed up depending \non your Baseline um it turns out even \nthe baselines for this model weren't \nvery good and we spent a little bit of \ntime improving those we had a blog post \nabout that over the summer and then once \nwe've improved that Baseline you know we \nwere still getting between 5 and 20x and \nwe hope this will be really useful to \nthe computer vision Community those who \nneed segmentation it's a smaller more \nNiche group \num but it's a Workhorse and it's really \nvaluable and then on the Bert side we'll \nbe releasing our recipe probably in the \nnext month or so you should expect again \nabout a 4X speed up on pre-training on \nyou know things like C4 but also \nprobably on any data set for academic \npurposes this is going to be huge \nwell you know we \nhonestly I can't talk about one other \nthing that we did with it because you \nknow I'll just say we're still in the ml \nPerth quiet period \num but you know you'll see more about \nBert soon on that front as well and \nwe're really proud of that some of this \nis even not even with the algorithmic \nspeed up so with really good systems \noptimizations as well \num GPT you saw our Baseline released you \ncan see this pattern Baseline speed up \nBaseline speed up Baseline speed up \num did that for estimate in June the \nspeed up for Baseline was back I think \nin July for segmentation three months \nlater speed up \num you just saw our llm Baseline a \ncouple weeks ago you know what to expect \ntoward the end of the year early next \nyear you know that's what I'm hoping \nwe'll have TPT three for 100k \nand then you know Bert Baseline we \ndidn't really push the Baseline too hard \nthis summer \num but you'll see the speed up out in \nthe next few weeks and so you know if \nour track record keeps up we're just \ngoing to keep doing this object \ndetection Baseline coming up in two \nweeks you know the drill \num I'll start working on self-supervised \nVision you know the drill we may work on \nsome diffusion models you know the drill \nand it's just you know keep cranking \naway at this honestly on llms I think \nthere's more than 5x there \nI'd love to get that cost under 100k \nyou know I'm not going to promise it \nbecause it's hard but I'd love to get it \nthere and what that also means is that a \n1 billion parameter model gets down into \na couple hundred dollars \nfor an academic researcher that's what \nimage that used to cost that's huge \nI'm still the second year PhD student \nwho didn't have as much compute as his \nfriend at least in my heart \num I want all Academia all people in \nAcademia to be able to do real \nscientific research that the folks in \nIndustry aren't doing so you know you \ncan see what we're doing on that front \nand then \na lot of the big promises were building \nit on Miss Mosaic Cloud which is a \nplatform that is meant to make it really \neasy to do this stuff you know \nyou know multi-node training where you \ndon't have to deal with any of the \nissues good integration with our recipes \nwhere we can automatically profile your \nnetwork and figure out which speedups to \nput in depending on your data set \ndepending on your model those sorts of \nthings we can catch you know lost spikes \nbasically it's you know trying to \nimagine what do I wish I had had that I \nwas doing my PhD and hopefully you know \nit's useful to more than just me \nbut you know the hope is that'll allow \nus to stay in business long enough to \nkeep giving cool things to the community \num and my hope is that if you train with \nus it'll be cheaper than training with \nany other Cloud because with our speed \nup methods you know our a100s are \nmagically 5x cheaper than everybody \nelse's \nso hopefully that'll you know that'll be \na nice gift we can give to the community \nin terms of dollars not just in terms of \nusing the speed up methods \nyeah well it's obviously you know \nBaseline speed up is a nice Trend to be \nfollowing um could we I mean um yeah \nlike you mentioned um you know detect \nMosaic will detect a lost Spike and then \nI think it resets it and maybe orders \nthe data differently um tell me a little \nmore about how uh the the recipes are a \ncomposition of like uh you know batch \nnormalization or different attention \nlayers and and maybe like clever ways of \ndoing Dropout like can you tell me how \nthe recipes are unique to each data set \nor or network or like how how is it not \nis it not just the same recipe or that \nkind of thing it's a good question it's \nsomething we're always studying and \nespecially right now we're doing a lot \nof probing for our old recipes figure \nout how broad they are like all right \nlet's take less than 50 when they \nmention that because it's a benchmark \nmost people are familiar with \nwhat happens if you run that recipe on \nthe places data set \ndoes it completely fall apart have we \nway overfit our recipe damage net have \nwe always fitted what if you changed the \nresolution \nhave we way over fit what if you change \nfrom reset 50 to resident 101 \nso we're working right now not just on \nthese great flashy recipes that give you \na 7x speed up put on nice generic \nrecipes that give you a consistent 3x on \na wide range of different things in an \narea so you know for Burton gbt that's a \nlot easier because language is language \nto a large extent for vision that's a \nlot more complicated because there are \nmany other angles to take so especially \nif my vision team were here right now \nthey would tell you that's the biggest \nworry on their mind is how generic are \nthese recipes and how do you make them \nmore generic \nbut at the end of the day you know a lot \nof what we're doing if you start to look \ninside it there's some stuff that's a \nlittle bit bespoke \num you'll see this with our recipe for \nimage segmentation where you know if \nyou're measuring dice as your metric you \nknow we've added dice to the loss \nbecause you know that's a really good \nway to improve your dice and it's \nsomething that people have proposed and \nonce you do it it does help a lot \num but there are other things we're \ndoing like exponential moving averaging \nto the model which is pretty generic it \nworks across all of our computer vision \ntasks so it's hugely helpful in MLP it \ndoesn't necessarily help but it doesn't \nhurt so there's no reason not to turn it \non or something like sharpness aware \nminimization where there are some hyper \nparameters you have to set but it's been \ngenerally helpful for computer vision \nso a lot of this or mix up a lot of this \nis actually pretty generic and I have no \nreason to believe it won't work on \npretty much any computer vision task \nit's up to us to prove that you know the \nthe burden of proof is on us but \nso far so good \nand I'm really pissed like you know it's \nI hope we'll have more results on that \nin the next month or so on how generic \nthese recipes are and whether you're \nreleased like you know the generic \nrecipe and the one built into our Cloud \nwill be the generic recipe that'll be \nwhat you get unless you really want to \nyou know go for it but you know if you \ncan get 3x instead of 5x but it works \nacross the board I think you're pretty \nhappy too \nyeah well and I it's a very interesting \npoint uh from imagenet to places or you \nknow satellite images I don't know \nmanufacturing images and the thinking of \nlike have all these data augmentations \njust been developed for say imagenet or \ndoes this really work for any kind of \ncomputer vision a super interesting idea \nI don't know yeah \nI mean um it definitely seems like maybe \nlike some of the cropping uh yeah I mean \nthe whole like think about like the \ndifference between satellite images \ncompared to image I think is very \ninteresting personally yeah if you would \nask my vision team they would tell you \nthey're specifically worried about that \nright now \num and so they're working on it and \nthey're getting a bunch of data sets and \nwe're going to find out what the generic \nrecipe is and I think we'll have you \nknow maybe that'll be the third blog \npost in each series you know it's our \nBaseline our best recipe then our \ngeneric recipe \nand I think that would be fun \num there's one other thing I wanted to \nthrow in here which is really \none of the big aspects of llms is \nactually this fully sharded data \nparallel Library \nand I think it's important to discuss \nfor a couple of reasons \num \nso when we train large language models \nthey're too big to fit on a single GPU \nin fact they're too big to fit on a \nsingle node oftentimes \nand not only that but the activations \nare too thick \nso you have to do what's typically \ncalled 3D parallelism \nwhich is where not only do you split the \nmodel across multiple gpus \nbut you also split the data across \nmultiple gpus which is what you usually \ndo data parallel training you also do \npipeline parallelism where you send each \nexample through the model in a pipeline \nfashion you accumulate the gradients as \nyou kind of pipeline the examples back \nand then at the end you apply the \ngradients to model and then you repeat \nso you don't even do it all in one step \nand you're constantly streaming \nactivations from you know first part of \nthe layer to the next you might even \nhave to do tensor parallelism and split \na tensor across multiple gpus these \nthings are huge \num and there's some fantastic Frameworks \nfor doing this so in the past one of the \nvery popular ones was deep speed \nis super popular for doing large \nlanguage model training we've worked \nclosely with the Deep speed team and \nthey're awesome \num they produce some awesome stuff in \nfact they produce this other cool thing \ncalled xero \nand it's a series of sharding operations \nfor charting the state of things like \nyour Optimizer and your model across the \ngpus and even in some of the fancier \nfloatations you know even doing \nactivation checkpointing to the CPU and \neven doing activation checkpointing to \nnon-volatile storage \nattached to your model this is really \ncool that's something I'll talk about in \na minute because I think that's just the \ncoolest thing in how they do it because \nif you train a large language model you \ndo so much reading and writing but \nyou'll actually burn out your SSD in the \ncourse of one training run \nbut that's fine because the rent is so \nexpensive that's one SSD \num but the nice thing about these is \nthat these sharding techniques actually \nreduce your need to do all these data \nall these parallelism techniques \nand so this fully shorted data parallel \nLibrary this is out of the folks at Fair \num but what it does is it's just data \nparallel but all it's doing is it's \nusing these zero techniques to Shard the \nmodel stay at the optimizer State across \nall the gpus in the cluster and so \ninstead of needing a ton of GPU memory \non a single node to do data parallel \ntraining and again data parallel \ntraining is just where you have the \nmodel you know you have multiple copies \nof the model in htpu you run different \nexamples through each through the models \nforward propagate backward propagate and \nthen merge the gradients so it's kind of \nit's the dumb thing that you would do if \nI gave you eight gpus and told you to \ntrain that's what we're doing on \nliterally everything else if you use pie \ntorch distributed data parallel for \nexample it's a naive thing \nfstp takes us back to a world where \nwe're just doing data parallelism \nyou don't have to do model parallel we \ndon't have to do tensor parallel we \ndon't have to do pipeline parallelism \nwhich is the nastiest but we're doing \nsmart sharding \nso it requires a lot more Network \nbandwidth in order to do the \nsynchronization but it's way simpler \nMegatron is notorious for being hard to \ncustomize \nthe models that we released for fsdp \nit's a one file \nand you just have to wrap some things in \nfstp but it's one file which means you \ncan customize it it's pure Pi torch \nso you can imagine for us at mosaic we \nwant to do speed up methods we need to \nbe able to modify the heck out of the \nmodel in various ways \nthat's really hard to do in Megatron \nit's a piece of cake in the simple \nnotation \nand I think it's what I like it too is \nkind of a like a cafe versus tensorflow \nversus Pi torch sort of thing \nlike we wouldn't have gotten a pie torch \nif we didn't have some Frameworks that \npreceded it that got better about coming \nup with the right apis \nI think it's the same thing with fstp in \nsome sense it's superseding Megatron or \ndeep speed at least for the moment which \nare superseding hand rolled Frameworks \nthat you had to come up with yourself \num because we've learned how to get the \ninterfaces right we've learned what is \nand isn't necessary to make things run \nwell \nand so my argument to all of you is if \nyou like to Pi torch over tensorflow \nyou're probably gonna like what we've \nput together in fsdp over Megatron \nand it's customizable and easy to use if \nyou want to tweak things and I think \nthat's resonated with people \nso you know maybe we'll have the Jacks \nthat will eventually replace this but at \nleast for now this is so much cleaner \nand so much easier and you don't have to \nuse things like Megatron that are really \nunwieldy and difficult to work with and \nI've heard nothing but complaints the \nsame way that in the tensorflow days \nkind of you know at least in tf1 \num it was the best game in town but it \nwas still something everybody complained \nabout I think we still complain about Pi \ntorch but a little bit less and now \npeople seem to love chaps \nI like to think we're getting to that \nplace with llms and again they are for \neverybody but we're still getting the \nsame utilization you would get with \nMegatron you're not giving up any speed \nyeah well that that's so fascinating and \npersonally I don't have enough \nexperience with these things to really \nkeep the debate going but I I do like \ncompletely appreciate the abstractions \nand the apis it it's just all incredible \nhearing about all these things and um \nand yeah so maybe uh pivoting topics \nlike could you tell me about your \nexperience with um building Mosaic as a \ncompany you know it's growing like crazy \nit's so interesting to see this you know \ncompany emerging can you tell me about \nyour experience building this \nit's been hard \nI think our CEO Naveen Rao will always \nsay you know building a company is one \nof the hardest things you could ever do \num there are a lot of hard things in \nlife this has been the hardest thing \nthat I've ever had to do \num definitely takes the cake on my PhD \nat a PhD you know you have to do good \nscience that's really hard and you have \nto create something that's never been \ncreated before that's really hard \num not only do we have to create \nsomething that's ever been created \nbefore you have to create something \nthat's actually useful to people and \nuseful enough that people will pay for \nit we have to understand what people \nwant we have to build one big thing \ntogether a PhD is very much an \nindividual Pursuit building something \ntogether is hard \num you know trying to figure out you \nknow you had seen like to get to the \nbase we do the Baseline blog post three \nmonths later we do the speed up blog \npost \nand to get those baselines it's probably \nanother three months of work which means \nthat we have to predict what our \ncustomers are going to need six months \nin advance if we want to have it ready \nthat's hard \nthis is all really hard in a space \nthat's changing so quickly and in a \nfinancial environment that's changing so \nquickly 2021 was a great year to be \nraising money \num \n2022 is not \nit's been a tough year for startups it's \nbeen a tough year for everybody in terms \nof you know tech companies \nand so all of that is really difficult \nkeeping a team focused keeping a team \nyou know with our eyes on the ball and \nwhat matters trying to serve our \ncustomers appropriately it is so hard \nand I'm sure you can speak to the same \nexperience it is so difficult and I love \nthe challenge I hope they'll succeed who \nknows \num but the experiences I've gotten and \nwhat I've learned have just been \nincredible I really didn't plan on doing \na startup that was I mean we've talked \nabout this a little bit more privately \nyou know that that was not my plan in \nthe least \num I'm really glad that I had this \nexperience \nthat's super interesting and you've \nalways amazed me with how many things \nyou're able to do in parallel I think \nwhen I first met you you were at \nGeorgetown you were at MIT you did \nFacebook how to like and now you're a \nprofessor at Harvard and Mosaic how do \nyou manage them like how was your kind \nof \ntime think like I'm very curious like \nhow you are managing your time sort of \nnot in your new role in Mosaic and also \nobviously your role in science \nit's tough It's genuinely tough I mean \nI'll tell you two things one I haven't \nstarted at Harvard officially yet I get \none more year but Harvard has been very \neffective at finding ways to get free \nlabor out of me so advising students \nwhich is a blast \num and I'm also managing their compute \ninfrastructure because I'm you know I'm \ndoing that in my day job so it's really \nuseful there it's been a lot of work and \nthen you know between you and me I still \nhaven't finished my dissertation \nI'm working on it but it turns out \nmosaic has been a huge distraction my \nadvisor will ping me periodically and \nyou know make fun of me like you know \nyour students realize you don't have a \nPhD yet right \num it's the biggest running joke at \nmosaic that like you know oh Jonathan he \ndoesn't have a PhD yet yeah my friends \nfind it so funny that I have a PhD and \nmy boss doesn't \num \nit's hard and I'm not sure I'm that \nsuccessful I've also chosen to \nprioritize work-life balance lately \nwhich has been really nice but also \num startups are demanding and they will \ntake all the time they can give them and \nI work really hard with my team to make \nsure they're taking vacation I yell at \nthem if I see them on slack on next \nweekend there are times for that and \nthere are times when we have to push but \nit shouldn't be all the time and if \nyou're in a place where you have to burn \nyourself out to be successful \nI don't know if that success is worth it \nto be completely honest \num there's much more to life than you \nknow suffering for your work \nand you know so yeah the answer is I \ndon't have the balance I should have but \nI have a hell of a lot more balance than \nthe last time we talked to the time \nbefore that and I'm really glad for it \nbut it's hard \num at the end of the day the people I'm \nmost responsible to are my team \nthey're counting on me to make sure they \nstill have jobs \nthey're counting on me to make sure that \nthey're doing the right work and you \nknow when push came to Sheldon it's a \nmatter of taking the evening off or \nmaking sure that my team is in a good \nplace and is safe and is happy you know \nyou've got to be people first \nyeah incredible Jonathan thank you so \nmuch for doing the podcast it's so \namazing getting to pick your brain about \nthese things there's so many interesting \nideas so caught up with it and you're \nbuilding such an incredible company and \nand yeah it's it's really cool to hear \nhow you know the people first the \nbalance and all that good stuff instead \nof some kind of like let's work \nourselves to death culture but but like \nyeah overall want to do the same \nfeedback back to you \num you know there's a life outside of \nwork don't you forget that either you \nlead a pretty busy life \nyeah well thanks again Jonathan thanks \nso much for doing the review podcast and \nit's awesome I'm so excited about these \nthings thank you so much for having me \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Jonathan Frankle on MosaicML Cloud - Weaviate Podcast #26", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFyYaZbRviY", "timestamp": "",
