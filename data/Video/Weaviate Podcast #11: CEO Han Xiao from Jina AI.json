{"text": "You can now use Weaviate as the document store for DocumentArray in Jina AI. We had the pleasure to talk with their CEO Han ... \nhey everyone thank you so much forchecking out the 11th episode of the weva podcast today i'm joined with hanxiao the ceo of gina ai gina ai is suchan exciting end-to-end search pipelinesoftware and so i'm really excited to betalking to han and learning more aboutthis so to kick things off han thank youso much for coming on the podcast andcould you tell us a bit about what geneis abouthey connor thanks for having me andreally glad to talk to you and also tothe vivian communityand uh yes sir my name is han i'm thefounder and ceo of gina ai andso gina ai is a very new company wefounded in february in 2020 duringpandemic and over the last year we havebeen building the new research ourpipelines the food stack solution uhincluding uh the framework itself butalso including the data structure thefine tuning uh and also the uh kind ofmarketplace online right so that'sthat's right now so right now we have 45people of the world our headquarter isbased is in berlin and right now i'msitting in my burning officeenjoying the ringing day here and uh youknow complaining about the weatherand you know making pull requests rightso that's that's kind of my daily workyeah i love learning about gina seeinguh the gina hub thing i thought wasreally cool the fine tuner the doc arraythe document executor flow and i'mreally excited to get into all thesethings but quickly could you take meinto what inspired your interest to workon uh say vector search and deeplearning for search and these kind ofapplicationsyes yes for sure uh so actually mylet's say my experience with newresearch uh back in the days we call ita neural information retrieval startingfrom 2017so when i worked at talento a germancompanywhich is a pretty bigonline fashion retailerit's like a mini amazon uh but not somany it's already one of the top 30companies in germany uh you know butback in the days it was not so big rightsoi was working there uhand working on the especially at workfor the recommendation team workinginside the recommendation team and lateri worked i built up the searched uh youknow the search system uh uh behindtalento right and then uh when we workat when we build this search system inthailand because it's a more fashionrelated you know you will see a lot ofpictures patterns some addresses uh onshirts and so on you see people lookingfor you know a very detailed patterns uhon their on their dresses right so let'ssay t-shirt with uh with some slo withsome slogan always certain logo i was asuperman on itbut back in the days you know we have uhwe have uh for each article back in thedatabase we put some text you knowmanually put some tasks to describe okayso what is this tag what is this articleis about is the tag could be uh like avisual based or it could be like uh isay this this uh this shirt is made ofcartoon it's made of a silk or whateverthis kind of things right uh it can bealso like a price tag a brand tagsometimes the tasks can only uh can alsocontains typo so i i remember veryclearly that uh when i brought thearticle to catalog of the articles i seethere are intentionally a lot of typosinside the tag i asked the people whyare they doing that and then the answeris because people search for those typosand then they want to heat the tables tothe articles they want to connect thetypos to articles so that's that was inthe days where you know deep learningwas not so evolved in the search systemand people tried to associate thearticle with the tags that is misspelledright and and then but the misspellingis one thing misspelling among all thenewer search problems is probably one ofthe smallest things that uh you knowthat we want to solve the most importantas back in the day the most interestingthings is about how do you searchthe uh the pattern like the the supermanon the t-shirt on the long-sleevet-shirt uh a short sleeve t-shirt youknow connects these things to thearticle by using image as a proxy rightso that's that's kind of the key problemand then as you can imagine it is uhit's kind of cross modality cross modelright so from text to image search butback in thailand it was uh more beyondthat the more interesting question istalent although it is a german companyis trying to provide service for 18countries in europe i remember veryclearly because we want to support 18different languages right uh in inacross europe and thenimagine that you build one text imagemodel and you have to rebuild anothermodel using query query to article thisdata set and let's say we have a verysmall country that we operate in verysmall countries let's say in polandright so there are not so many germanfans in poland and then the people youknow people don't use hilando there anduh uh so how do we want to build suchmodel uh from from polandtheir language uh to the article becausewe don't have this training dateright soone way so we're facing very serious uhlike this is this kind of code startproblem because we lack of training dataif we want to if we ever want to build atraining model from scratchso back in the day is my goal right myso i later work in thailand research andwe try to solve this two problem in oneshot rightthe two problem one is from text toimage the second is from multilingualtextto image right so try to solve this twoproblem in one shot and then at the endwe come up with a new research pipelineuh let's say back in the days we call itthe deep learningretrieval pipeline uh which basically isa very end-to-end solution and try tosolve try to combine these two problemsin one big deep learning framework ofcourse it's very competition demandingback in the days because there was nobirth model and everything has to beusedbetween the rstm and uhpeople were not very smart enough ofconfidence enough of using this kind ofuh you know attention since back in theday there was no thing as attention oneverything rstm either rn or lcm andthen especially you want to add multiplelayers on top of rcm and then you wantto build this rstm cnn it's like afrankenstein you you put the rstmcntogetherit was terrible model but right in thedays you know this kind of terriblemodel is mainstream rightin the market so that was thefirst start and we i published articleabout talking about this thefrankenstein model uh i think in 2018 uhin january basically summarizing my workback in thailand and that that is thetime where i left as helena after threeand a half years we worked with thisfrankenstein modeli left orlando and working at a chinesecompanycalled tencent it's very big one of thebiggest chinese internet companyand mostly popular in east asiaso back in tencent we havea social appuh called wechat as you can imagine it'slike whatsapp but this is like a a minioperating system that inside your phoneright because it can you can do a lot ofthings you can do payment uh you canhave a party you can you can try you canbuy stock uhinside wechat you can do a lot of youcan also play games of courseand uh uh so inside reach head we have alot of we have also our our own kind oflike a facebook timeline so it's a minisocialuh social social network it is a closedsocial network it's not like everybodycan view so you can only view otherpeople's timeline if you are the friendsof the other people rightand uh because it is a closed sourceit's not closer to because it is closedecosystem then the content that you thatyou publish there whether it is an imagevideos audios the content you publishthere stays inside this ecosystem sothat means you cannot really google itfrom outside right because google cangoogle uh this uhcrawling boat they can not really touchthis close a closed systemand then we have a very strongneed of searching those content how tohow to get those content out how to makethis content searchable and thiscontents including the text the audioslike the auto snippet where you'll seyou you use it you send in the whatsappright and also the videos uh images andso on rightand also stickers emojisso now the requirement back in tencentwas how can we build an infrastructurethat can search all the kind of datatypes that we have rightuh so tencent actually has this systemwhich is built on top of elasticsearchright so and theythey actually they forked a very earlyversion of elasticsearch uh and theythey added a lot of plugins on top ofthatuh i remember back in tension we haveseven layers of plugins so the pluginshas its own plugins so we have in totalseven layers of plugin it isunderstandable because tencent is superbig company and over years you gatherlike a seven layers on on top of theelastic search and thenso basically every plugin focus on veryniche particular search use casesand then you know when i joined tencenti look at this another frankenstein youknow leaving from one of frankensteinand joining another function and look atthis architecture and then i did whatevery engineeryou know would like to do is to firstuh distract these things right so firstto destroy the scenes and build anothernew one right so uh and then i bring myknowledge license learner from talentoand then try to try to use a completelydeep learning mindset and need torestructure to refactor the uh thearchitecture and then in 2019 weproposed a framework called genericneural elastic search genus which is youcan imagine it's like a father of ginatodayand the idea is really tovery radically using containerizationmicroservices idea and wrap every stepin thein the search pipeline to to separateevery step every step in the searchpipeline each one as a own microserviceand then connect and then use acontainer to wrap this microservice andfinally connect the dot dots toorchestrate them together right sothat's kind of the you know a big shiftfrom back in the days the elastic one isa big monolith program by contention andnow we're shifting to a very radicalmicro serviceuh architecture right and uh so that wasageneric neural elastic search so you canstill find this uh github repositoryonline but it's not really maintainedthe sunset archived already uh but thenwhen i work at tencent i you know i inlike working for this project for aboutone year and then this project getscancelled for the reason that they wantto focus on video search right becauseback in the days there was a some veryintense competition between tencent andtick tock uh basically it's a thecompany behind uh uh sorry the tick tockis a product and the company behind ticktock is called buy downs right backdowns and there was a serious veryintensive competition between tencentand buy downs and then you know as aresult so the company decided to spend alot of human resources in the videointelligence right they try to analyzevideos do some smart videorecommendations all these kind of thingsso instead of uhdoing what genus uh original vision isabout the original vision of gina ofgenus is aboutbuilding a universal search engine forevery kind of data right so whether it'stext video sound audio 3d models and soon right so that's that's kind of like auh disappoint me uh disappoint me alittle bit and therefore like uh afterseeing through all the how the decisionsyou know landscape all this open sourcemy my my interest in open source allthese kind of things and i decided toleave tens and i started to start thiscompany right in 2020 uh january sothat's kind of the back story uh of ginaand whyi'm working in the new research todaywell thank you so much that was such acompelling back story andi love that frankenstein analogy i thinkthat really resonated with me is thisidea of how we have all these differentcomponents of these search pipelines andthe seven layers of plug-ins and thebackground on on your journey i reallythought that was such a compellingbackstory so thank you so much for thatso to kind of transition a little bitand to try to unpack this frankensteinuh could you explain to people what uhwhat make up these search pipelines whatare the key components of themyeah so i i think the uh a lot of peoplewhen they first talk about neural searchit seems that okay so it's not so it'snot so difficult it's just like you youcompute cosine distance and that's itrightto be honest it is true right butproviding that you have a goodrepresentation rightthen you compute cosine distance rightif you don't have good representationsand you know computing whatever distanceis minimized rightuh and then so and then there's a bunchof people from machine learning justthink that okay so especially rightafter birth right right in the age oftransfer learning that everybody knowsthat okay representation is a key rightso everything can be represented by avector right so whether it's a vector uhimage to vector text vector whateverbirth this kind of things right thisthis concept what actually this conceptwas not there right back in 2000or something like that so the only thingthat was popular back in the days wasword to backwhich compared to today's this vectormodel is completely different scenerighta globe this kind of thing and right nowglobal is only used for initializationit's like usa and you have finalproducts it's just used as aneutralization right so it's a it's ahuge paradigm shift right but back inthe days there were two two big thingsaboutenabling a good neural search is one isyou need to have a good representationso that requires a very strong machinelearning model right and then the secondstep is uhyou need to have a good distance afaster retrieval somehow you can computethe distance similarity vector vector byvector vector by matrix and matrix bymatrix this kind of similaritycomputation has to be fastand then uh so basically it'scompetition and storage rightcompetition and storage uh somaps to today we have the machinelearning power and then the databaseright sothis is kind of the big two biggestconcept you know that can power thatkind of like the two pillars of yoursearch right uhbut uh if you zoom in into the pipelineyou found that okay so therewhen you of course these two pillarsitself has a lot of lot of you knowdetails demo in the details there are alot of lot of details to to beimplemented right for example in themetric uh in the in the database partyou know how do you store those thingsefficiently right uh how do you uh howdo you can you use something else ratherthan euclidean distance for example okayyou know float 60 64 or flow 32 is justtoo space consuming can i just converteverything into integer or binary andthen still compute somehow this distanceright or why does the distance must becosine or euclidean or harming distancecan it be some distance that's learnedby some models right so there are a lotof things that you can dowith with just the database part withjust the vector retrievaland then on the on the machine learningpart of course like a different modalityhow to convertimage to vector text to vector audio tovector and most importantly how can youconnect the image and text right combinethe multi modality how can you cross themodality to get a vector representationbut apart from thatas i said devil in details right sothere is apreprocessing steps and apost-processinguh in the neural search pipeline uh forexample in the pre-processing step solet's say you have a big picture andthis picture big picture contains a lotof very very complicated concepts sothere are a lot of objects in thatpicture right and then i have a searchquery i have a i want to search for avery simple object which is like a justa single apple this my image my imagequery my query image is just an applebut then all the image that you have inthe database it's very super common it'slike a mcdonald's menu right it containsa burger it contains a french fries itcontains uh cola all these kind ofthings every every picture is amcdonald's menu but then your queryimage is just appleso you can immediately see that eventhough you use the same model uhuh for representation the thethe vector representation the semanticbehind this vector representation is notreallyuh symmetric right so this brings us tothe question likeit's so so this brilliant bringmakes me think that you know you cannotreally expect one single model withoutany pre-processing just storing somedata it will give you some goodembedding right so therefore uha very important step back in tencent isabout pre-processing like for examplehow can we cut how can we segment theimage into different chunks a differentgranularity right in order to getembedding a kind of a hierarchicalembedding righton the very uh you know on the very toplayer you have the overall bird view ofhow you know kind of a birdviewembedding and then you can segment itall the way to the bottom you get a veryfine-grained granularity this kind ofembedding to describe each object rightsoin the end one document whether it is animage or text or a chapter of of bookwill end up with not only one embeddingbut a lot of embeddings right a group ofembeddedthen how do you match your query whichcould be also a group of emails toanother group of embeddings right sothis is not simple cosine similarity andthen you can imagine thatwhen we put the problem into this setupthe database is just a two it's a veryatomic operations to enable suchretrieval but that is not enoughpre-processing is important to get thegraph to get the correct granularity uhto get the group so get the correctgroup of embeddings and but also thepost-processing is also important youhave to aggregate the group of embeddingscores the scores from different groupsfrom different hierarchies you know tointo the final result right so this is athis is just one simple example you knowwhen it comes to the image search andthen you can imagine in the video searchwhere you you have a video input videoof like 45 minutes uh and then yoursearch query your query video is justlike one or two seconds or it could belike just a short video like what yousee what you agreed on uh tick tock sothat then you need a preprocessing stepsuch as segmenting by shots right andthen combining the frames into shots andshortening the frames all these kind ofheuristicsin order to get a good search qualityyou cannot expect that i threw a two orthree seconds video into the embeddingmodel and then 45 minutes video intointo the same embedding model and theresult uh embedding would be somehowcomparable right so that's that's that'swhy you know in gina we focus on thefull stack on the end to end experienceour final search quality not really onthe computation part not really on thedatabase part but on the fine on thefull stack uh you know experience ofyour searchall right so another great uhgreat cluster of information i learned alot from that and i really like umjust coming back to the beginning ofwhat you said with uh with thecomputation the storage and in we'veeight we'veexplored things like the h sw vectorindex for having the centroids to speedup the search and we've explored binarypassage retrieval for having the binaryrepresentations of vectors so the twothings that we've seen a lot with thevva side on the vector database storageand so i ithought that pre-processing thing was sointeresting that added a lot a lot to myknowledge and so is this talking aboutusing say object detection models orsemantic segmentation models to toseparate the objects and then you haveembedded so say you classifyuh this is the basketball in the imageand do you then have an embedding forthat basketball window and thencan you tell me a little bit more aboutthen how these embeddings are youmentioned it's hierarchically aggregatedgive me a little more detail about howyou assemble these embeddingsyeah so i i think see i think you'redefinitely right so this is athe rough idea is about you knowdecoupling con you know divide andconquer right divide and conquer andfinally you assemble all the scorestogether but when it comes toapplications how do you ensemble themlike you usually want to put some weightyou you don't want to just sum upeverything together you want to somehowput waste on the on the bottom layer andthen bubble this up to the top linkrightbut bubbles is up to the to the to theoriginal document which is a the thingthat you want to search for rightuh so uh so the installing strategy isactually highly correlated with your andapplication right so let's say if i'mdoingto document search i just want to lookfor reference right i just want to uhcopy paste a paragraphabstract into my search engine i want tolook for the you knowwhat what are the other academic papersyou know have the same idea right i wantto search for thisthen you can see the query thegranularity of the query it's probablyone or two sentences but then the searchresult is a full document right so theyare on different granularity so theassembling procedure will probably goyou know all the way to the top to getto the full the full information of thefood document right in order to beforeit returns to user another thing is youstill have the same thing you stillinput one or two sentences but it'sabout describing a problem so let's sayin the long document qa rightyou ask a question about this longdocument and then it returns someanswers right and then in this case theanswer the return results it's just aone or two sentences or sometimes it'sjust just a token rightone or two tokens right then you see thegranularity is somehow you know it'seven smaller than your input granularityso the the final pre the pre-processingprocedure the pre-processing step andthe incentive step highly depends on howdo you want to what is your applicationis about but in the middle there areprobably some reusable building blocksthat you can use it regardless of theapplication and that's actually inspiredus to do gina hub right for example forthe two examples i talked aboutgiving abstract searching for academicpapers and asking a question aboutacademic papers highlighting the resultthese two applications share the samenatural language embedding model theycan share the same language languageembedding model even though their finalusage appearing would be would becompletely different a user interactionwould be also become a completelydifferent one could be just thetraditional search box and the othercould be just a qa chatbot rightand uh so in this caseyou knowas i said it's highly depends on yourfinal application butbut that also means you know although itdepends on application but as aframework as something like we are wecall ourselves a framework company orinfrastructure company as a framework wewant to get ready for that we want tomake sure that user once user has thisneed has this idea of you know breakingdown into different granularity and thencombining this up once they have thisidea they can implement such ideasunder gina right so that's that's kindof if you zoom in to dock array and goto docker array website documentationwebsite you can see that the docudocument which is uh like a primitivedata type in in gina in dark arrayare like in gina ecosystem it's actuallynested and hierarchicit's recursive right so the document cansub document and subdocument cancontains its own sub document not onlyon the vertical direction it isrecursive but it's also on thehorizontal direction so that means adocument kind of has its own nearestneighbors a soft document that can haveall can also has its own nearestneighbors so you can imagine this isbecomes a tree right so it's kind of arecursive in both horizontal and alsovertical directions so this gives a verypowerful representation uh for user torepresent a complicated object andallowing them to you know traverse overthis very complicated document uhbubbling up the scores assembling thescores very easy so that's kind of theidea of dockery and we actually foundthis kind of pattern a long time beforebut we just previously it was just partof gina and now we pull it out as aseparate project and then you know serveit as a common cornerstone for all ofour products uh in our ecosystemso this doc ray is it kind of similar tohow you have like a json schema that canembed you you could put like you knowanother dictionary within the kind ofpython dictionary data structure jsonthat kind of yes that kind of structureand can you tell me more about uh ginahub how do people contribute to itwhat's kind of the organization of ityeah so gina hubgina hubba is a very interesting storyuh has a very interesting story so to befrank uh we failed uh two times beforethe scenes that you see today right soi'm i'm going to be very frankly right imean marketplace like it's very obviouslike everyuh you know not every not apple donot apple to marketplace google also doa marketplace right they have app storeyou have google play which is like appstore marketplaceit seems so obvious that a lot ofsoftware company also like to domarketplace right uh you knowsome of the very popular open-sourcecompany also has a marketplace runningand i believe you right now if you talkabout if you go to any uh ecosystem likewhether it is about your search ordatabase uh you know security they willall have their own marketplace so wealso observe that i will see that okayso everybody has marketplace it must bevery easy to do that it must be veryobvious to do that right and then westart with the first marketplace whichcomes which is completely powered bygithub right becausebecause you can abuse github by you knowby putting by storing all your kind ofalgorithm inside one repository so thenyou have a kind of verypoor man version of the uh of the hubthis is exactly what we did for thefirst project righti kind of have a collection ofrepository in github repository in onesingle github repo right but later wefound out this doesn't scale because youknow you know everything does sticktogether is like you have a very smallroom and there are 20 peoplein that you know there a lot of things alot of conflict management developmentmanagement issues uh so this doesn'tscale skills out right so this actuallyslows us down uh when we try to updatesome something uh update some uh youknow some dependency all these kind ofthingsand then the second version is uhwe look at all the so that was the firstuhfailure right back in i think this wasback in theuhuh 2020 2020 in winter right we realizedthat okay so this doesn't work right souh you know we kind of put or we kind ofuh you knowuh suspend this project you know projectlike forever right andin 2021 we restart this project becauseyou know everybody do marketplace westill want to do marketplace you know weare one of the cool guys and we stillwant to do marketplace and we thinkabout okay souh we failed because of the you knoweverybody has to go to github githubrepository and there's no veryinteraction user engagement on that solet's first let's focus on ui right solet's first build a very nice graphicuser interface to attract people thereand with car design bootstrap you knowthis kind of uhcard things and and thenthis version of cars also fails right soit fails because there is noinfrastructure that supports thismarketplace rightso basically the infrastructure is notup to date it's still like a veryrepulsory base and then you basicallybuild a static website which somehow youhave some nice card and then link backto the github repository right this alsodoesn't work and then i started to asthis failure was the second failure thathappens inuh summer 2021 i think in may 2010something like thatand as i start to think about this mostseriously right i started to think aboutokay so what does it what has acornerstone what are the pillars thatmakes a good marketplaceand uhi summarize as a three points right uhuh so it is just my personal opinions uhprobably some people don't agree on thisso the first point is you need a goodinfrastructure all right so think aboutapp store right so you download an appfrom the app store from apple app storerightit seems that you have the same downloadspeed whether you're locating in us orwhether you are in china or you're ingermany you have you basically have thesame download speed and every time theapp is updated you get notified everytime your ios is updated then theapps that requires to be updated updatedoutdated automatically the apps that arenot necessarily yet to be updated stayon the same versionso this is an infrastructure it issomething thatbelongs to this marketplace without thisinfrastructure app store won't workright you won't receive pushnotification you won't receive pushupdate you won'tyou know you won't get a lot of versionconflict you know after the operatingsystem operating updates and you getyour your apps cannot use anymore so thereason the fact that you don't observethis from day to day is that appleimplements a very good infrastructurebehind their app storeright so why do we care about this wehave the same problem we have a ginawhich is like the ios like the operatingsystemand the executor which is like thereusable building block it's like theapp on the app store so there areversion control issues there are updatesissuers who updates first and who getsupdated what is the cost what is theconsequence and you know and all thepush things right so you want to pullyou want to use executor inside gina andthen pull this and then pull and thenyou want to encourage community to pushit and then whether the developer hascertificate authentication all thesekind of so this is infrastructureproblem right which support whichbecomes the first successful factor of amarketplaceand then the secondis the content right so let's say webuild a very good infrastructure rightbut nobodyliterally nobody uh you know contributeson that then this is also bad i thinkyou know right now one of the mostsuccessful open source arp company inthe world has very successful and activemarketplace it's because a lot ofcontributors a lot of people in this andcontribute very good uh content to thatto give you a better example let's don'ttalk about competitors right so let'slet's just use xbox right some peoplelike xbox some people like sony ps4 orps5but what matters let's say comparingside by side their graphic cards theircpu gpo this kind of thing you knowcontrolleryou can talk about this right you cancompare side by side but that's thenursing right so that's very nerdyuh what really matters isin this platform do you have theirfavorite games here right do you haveyour favorite games thereuhnintendo 3ds right so there is a thereis a there is a lot of like a very veryuh you know it's very bad hardware rightand but then you have a very good uhzelda right on this on this consoleright so that's why uh you know peopleplay that right and uh let's say if youhave a infrastructure that's of coursenot enough you you have a marketplaceyou need to have a good content you needto have sexy content that lure people inright and so people it is exclusive tothis platform right so let's say we havea new bird modeland this is first available in thismarketplace right then this is a thisthis generates an impact that you knowattracts people to your marketplace sothe content is the second successfulfactor uh but also like a content is notreally it's it's really it's i mean it'svery easy to summarize like this butwhen you try to implement that itactually involves engineering effortdebris effort uh research effortbusiness developing effort a lot ofthings rightand then the third thing is sociala lot of people missing the social partsthe social pillars of the marketplace uhthis uh so think about this uh so iremember in the old days we have googlechat or msn messenger right i mean theyare not really like uh uhkind of like a really easy to use rightespecially msn messenger a livemessenger microsoft live my center it'snot really easy to use but you still usethat because your friends using thatrightuh so this is a social factor of themarketplace if we can make sure thatyour friends your colleagues right yourfriends in the data science communityalso use the same platform right thenthis is what makes the marketplace moreactiveso these are the three factors that ieventually summarize you know before westart the third version of gina hub andthis is the kind of the the gina hubthat you see today on the surface yousee okay there's a our cage interfacethere and there is uh some some kind ofuh contents there but underneath we havea very very powerful infrastructure sowhat you see right now is just avirtualization layer so you see a bunchof docker images there it looks likevery static but right now with gina 3release so this eachuh docker image there suddenly becomes adarker container that is already runningit is we call it sandbox so you candirectly query it as a macro service youcan without even downloading withouteven pulling for your local right sothis basically suggests thatbesides virtualizationpart which we are alreadyhave a good computation layer under thehub right and then we have we have uh ifyou if you read our documentations uhvery carefully uh very very closelyyou'll find that there is a docker ratepush and pulland this is actually the storage part ofthe hub system so overall if you ask mewhat is what is my vision what is hubabout i would say hub is aboutthree pillars right nowthe you know not easy umnow the the social you knowinfrastructure these things but thethree pillars ofuhvirtualizationcomputation and storage so those are thethree pillars three layers of the hubsystemand that we have andthis well actually becomes theuh let's say this is the highlight ofthe county in this year so we will spenda lot of energy a lot of human resourcesin the hub and the hub will become themiddleware of the camp all right so itwas support gina it was support finetuner darquery and all the product allthe ecosystem that we havewow that's incredible i think that'ssuch athis is a great master class on themarketplace and and the hub and allthese things can you take me through howthesesay modular components and i i love thatmicro service so you can query it and itcan be independent and you can test itthat way i think that's so excitingcould you take me through uh i thinkit's uh document executor flow can youtake me through how youhow these things all plug togetheryes yes definitely so i think the uh thedocumentary executor and flow this threeconcept has been zero uh let's say uhsince we first since we write the firstline of the code right so we have wehave we actually have a lot of conceptsright so we havewe have a lot of concept like a driverexecutor p pod a runtime uh zenflow sowe have like a we we used to have afamily picture right andthere is a wait wait we actually plot weactually uh asked uh uh a a uh you knowa illustrator uh kind of like anillustrator and help us to draw somecartoon figure for each kind of uhcanton picture for each kind of figurefor each component that we have but thenlater we murder everybody that we kindof refactor all the things that we killeverybody and then the only threeleftovers are executors document adocument executor and flow right sothat's the three concept that weeventually realized that okay in orderto let user to know about your search touse your search these are the only threeconceptsthat users need to know nothing morerightbefore that we have the idea that okayso you know we are so awesome onengineering so we are so awesomeso so uh so smooth and refactoring buildall these abstractions since let's tellthe user about it but the user don'tdon't buy it it's just like you sellthem a burger you only tell you'll onlytalk about the meat you know this is avacuum meet or whatever this verypremium value you don't talk aboutcheese or pickles in the burger right soi i never see there is a burger companysaying that okay we use the best picklebecause it's meaningless right so peopleonly care about the meat rightor the best of bong or whatever there'ssaidno one give a damn about this right sothat's that means that when you when youtry to build a product right you onlytell the users the necessary part inorder to satisfy them and then thenecessary part in the gina ecosystemwhat we say that is in your searchecosystem is document which describesthe objects the real world objects youwant to search or you want to index itcould be a pdf it could be an imagevideo audio mp3 mp4 those kind ofand then the executor executor isbasically like an algorithm uhespecially uh you know the algorithmunit of how you want to process thisdocument uh the executor could beindexing could be bird could be storingor it could be pre-processing scoringall that kind of stuffand finally the flow the flow is kind ofconnecting all the executors and putsthem togetherso the reason of using executor is uhit's actually uhmaking the original very local uhorientated algorithmnetwork ready or cloud ready as a cloudready so basically uh by using executoryou cannot wrap your algorithm with anetwork layer so that it becomes a kindof micro service that are ready for theflow to be connect with to orchestrateright and then the flow is a finalcomposer of everything right so you canimagine i'm a flow i'm a composer i'm anorchestrator so all the executors aresitting there and i just connect thedoors and then to accomplish certaintasks right so that's kind of the threeconcepts that we eventually found youknow uhthat are really necessary for the endusersso when people push a micro service togina hub is it wrapped in one of thoselike they're either uploading anexecutor algorithm or an overallorchestrationis it one of those three things they'repushing to the marketplaceyes so right now you can so if you usedocument array push pull so youbasically you trigger the storage layeryou actually store your document arrayon in the hub and if you push a executorinto the hub you basically uh it willactually buildyour executor into a docker image into adocker container and make it a serviceready right on the on the on the hubright so this is a this is yourexperience on the whether you can deployan end-to-end thing like a flow rightnow or multiple executor or subfloorright a subfloor subfloor is also veryinteresting right so let's say it's nota single exerter can do these things butyou know let's say 2x heater can concattogether you want to make it a subflowand you make it reusable in some othertasks this is also very interestingconcept but at this moment the hub isnot supporting subfloor or the flowlevel deployment or push-pull thingsright it only supports executor anddocument level push-pull yeah but as youcan see this is a very natural step thatwe will work on uh in the next couple ofmonthsso say to come back to our earlier uhexample of where you're parsing an imagefor to get out the different clothingswith say an object detection model wouldyou wrap that into a pre-processingexecutor and then you'd push that to thegina hub and that would be thecontribution yeah exactly exactly that'sthe point yeah exactly very coolthat's super cool so so coming a littleout of the end to end and a little backto the embeddings themselves i want toask you about the fine tuner library andthe things that are in it like the lostfunctions hard negative mining and uhand the general concept of sayoff-the-shelf embeddings versus thesefine-tuned embeddings yeah yeah exactlyso so this is a this is a scene that uhuhthis is another missing piece uh youknow when weuh but we actually to be honest wedidn't uh we didn't come up with thisidea when we built a company let's sayback in 2020 in february we don't havethis idea we didn't have this ideabut while we are developing or makingsynergy building some prototype with ourclients we found ourselves always stuckin the position whereafter deployment after this thing isdonethere is no way to improve it furtherright we have seen him we have beenseeing a lot of ways like you know hyperparameter optimizing you know uh usingsome heuristics uh this kind of thingbut in the end what really matters isabout the embedding the representationwhether it is good enough for theranking problem right because it's notlike a classification it's not forgeneral representation it's for veryspecific ranking right can you can yousort a before b right so that's thethat's that's the that's the idea rightso we we always stuck there right wealways say that okay so at this pointprobably you only need to rely you youcan only hope that google or open aigives you a better model rightuhso at some day last summeri i said that's enough right so we needto do somethingwe need to do something about thisthis uh these embedding things aboutthis naughty embedding right and thensince october uh uh since august we havethis idea and then we spent two monthsto develop the first prototype and thenwe published we released as a opensource package in october uh fine tunerin october soif you count the date by date so we areonly one month late than google sogoogle released such fine-tuning metriclearning toolsback in 2021in september and we released that in2021 in october right so that's that'suh that's that's basically show us howwe you know we look ahead in terms ofthis marketplace so why i think this isnecessary why do i think this isimportant because i believethe tools such as tensorflow or pi torchis not designed for fine tuning so youknow that in the transfer learning togive you some background transferlearning you know first uhtraining from scratch and then secondyou'll you'll fine-tune something rightso this is a this is usually a two-stepprocedureand thentensorflow and paid torch or whateverthis other deep learning package theyare very good at building a model fromscratch where you need to write aarchitecture a network architecture fromscratch this is a completely differentin the fine tuning usually you don't dosuchwritinglike a writing phone writing a bignetwork architecture in the fine tuningprocedure usually you just mask out somelayers uh usually you just add somelayers mask or some layers leveragingthe existing pre-trained weights andthen do some progressive learning rightso this design pattern this usagepattern is also different quitedifferent from you know from zero to onethings right so you can imagine youbreak down the whole procedure from zeroto one and then from one to n right andthen this needs a two different kind oftwo kits or two twos right so uh sothat's why i believe uh you know i i'mpretty sure that a lot of people usingtensorflow or pytorch for fine tuningbut i don't believe this is the righttools for finding i believe we need adifferent tools which is very good atmasking out or selecting which can befine-tuned in the network architecturecan be very smoothly integrate humanfeedbackin the fine-tuning procedure becausethis is super supervision andand also of course bring the bestquality right out of that so based onthis consideration so if you look at theinitial uh you know concept of finetuners that we have it actually composedof three components uh the trainer ofcourse is uh you know training all thesethings and the tailor uh tailor is uhyou know you can mask out some of thelayers or you decide to you know addsome layers on top of that usually arelinear layers as back as a asas a as the end or you can freezecertain layers rightand finally uh the labeler right so alabeler is allowing people users to uhinteractively label the wrong data andin the next iteration it triggers someactive learning you know selects thenext hard examples and then uh tells theuser to label uh you know to improve thetraining efficiency right so the tailortrainer and labeler right so that's thethree original concept uh uh componentsin the fine tuneand uh i still believe that this is thisis very true that you know in this age alot of you are seeing more and morecompany focus instead of focusing ontraining from scratch rightthere's still companies like focus ontraining from scratch but then i'mexpecting that more and more companyfrom this year you know they will startto developing tools developing surveysforfine tuning right because training fromscratch is not really doable by a lot ofcompanies whether it isyou know time wise or money wise youdon't you have to spend a lot of talentsresources money uh gpu right electricityyou know build on training somethingfrom scratch but the fine tuner isdifferent right you you don't want tospend a lot of effort you want tooptimize the time to market rightand then the the training from scratchpart is not part of the time to marketthe fine tuning who can ever provide thebest fine tuning uh who can win the timeto market partsuper interesting and i really want toask also about your view on promptingversus fine tuning next but then just toquickly unpack these things a little biti really liked your description of thetaylor part i think that's sointeresting say the lottery tickethypothesis how we know that there's thissparse sub network within the densearchitecture that can retain the fullperformance but there isn't really agood masking interface as you say toimplement that masking and pie torch ortensorflow bit of a headache you gotyourself in yeah exact things we'veand things we've seen with say theadapter and compactor layers a recentpaper vision and language adapterthey're able to fine tune they only needfour four point four percent of theoriginal clip parameters to fine tune itbecause what they're doing is they havethese intermediate layers that theyfine-tune they don't fine-tune the wholenetwork architecture so as han'sdescribing this tailor part is such aninteresting part and so i think we'llcome back to the labeler part i wantedto ask you a little more about that butto kind of stay on this topic of tuninggenerally um what are your thoughts onsay prompting large models compared tofine-tuning themyeah i i i know this uh so i know theproblem to you this kind of thing isvery uh becomes very uh let's say a lotof attention uh in the especially inthese years i think it's super i thinkit's super useful like i i we i rememberthere was a recent paper about the maskauto encoder which is kind of like aprompting and then in the region part ithink this idea is veryuh it's very related to fine tuning butthen people people really now even talkabout you know in the fine tuning can weeven skip the labeling part can we justrely on self learning can we selflearning can we just leverage theredundancy of the data itself and thenuse it for fine-tuning including problemhere is one part mask auto encoder isanother technology but also likeaugmentation i think this is thesethings are very very related and weactually have we actually plan to haveall of them in the fine tuning frameworkyeah i see that as a part of the searchlike because the way you can ensembleall the outputs with the differentprompt in the like test time dataaugmentation and that kind of thing soso coming back into the components ofthe fine tuner could you tell me aboutthe labeler a little more you mentionedthe active learning where you say bubbleup the most uncertain predictions tosave for labeling but is this withrespect to similarity labeling withrespect to like say triplet losses whereyou're saying these are similar this isa hard negative or something like thatand and if so when you're labeling baseand similarity do you kind of have likeuh like a a similarity graph where iftwo things are similar well it's likeit's also similar to that other thingyou labeled it right so how do you kindof organizeannotation ofcontrast of learning modelsyeah exactly so so there there are twoquestions so one is uhlike what to label right so whether youselect the most confident one and tellthe model is very confident they sayokay so i'm pretty sure that this is thecorrect prediction and then you give ita bump you say that no this is notcorrect are you you're telling the modelto return the most unconfident one rightso the model is yeah i'm not so sureplease help me human rights so eithereither way this could work right so i iremember you know my phd was actuallyabout adversarial learning it's aboutselecting the example that can ruin thewhole thing right so this is like theveryvery deconstructive part right so uh butbut i so there i i learned a lot ofmodels a lot of measured about how toselect uh the examples uh you know therethere are a lot of a lot of measured alot of lot of like a family of measuresso some are based on the uh you know byspace based on the uhi remember when i work on that it'smostly about labeling for svm so thereis like a margin based approach and thenas people select the the data pointsthat are very close to the margin arevery far away from the marginin order to do that right so there isalso related somehow related to the uhrandom procedure a random process like agaussian process so for each data pointyou have kind of like a confidenceinterval and then you kind of use thisconfidence interval as a kind of themetric to ask a human to labor right sothis is one thing i think there is novery deterministic conclusion on thisright a very very uh very very certainconclusion on this uh so that's why inthe in this framework we try to providethe mainstream one right so those areall this mainstream one and then thesecond problem is actually moreinteresting right uh i believe you seethe spacey have a nice very nicelabeling tools uh which called i forgottheir name is a guy i think it's aparody or something like thatand uh it has very nice ui i i reallylike it i actually learned it a lotfrom when i do the fine tunerlabelers interfacebut then it is different like in spacesuhspace is an nrp company by the way soit's a focus on text processing all thiskind of thing in spaces labeler they tryto label the name entity so it's mostlylike uhyou know you highlight some part of thetext and then you label with someentities but in ranking it is differentright so how many results you want togive to the user how how do you want torepresent the relationship between youknow it's a kind of older relationshipvery you want to represent it verynicely to the labelerand uh asking them to label it you knowvery efficiently because usually when idesign the label interface this involvestwo parts so one is for the developerfor the machine learning expert you knowusually who's sitting behind the labelerwho will try to guide the algorithm topause it pose a question to the labelerso those people you have to make surethat the graphic user interface makessense for them makes sense from themachine learning perspective you knowyou are asking the right question andthen you you your user interface is notmisleading the labeler to give you thewrong answer right so this is one partright and then the second part isprobably more dark than your thought isthat you have to make your interfacevery efficient for labeleryou you don't want to you don't want tointroduce a lot of video concepts youknow a lot of uh you know a lot of uhvery visual visual studios to distractthem you don't want to introduce verycomplete concept that labeler cannotreally understand what you know how tochoice or let's say for you for exampleuh you know i i ipreviously saw there is a user interfaceasking the labeler to drag and drop youknow to drag a scroll bar to select uhto to raisehow relatedwhich is you know it's like a i wouldnever go for like uh in the middle rightsoi will just go either on the on thenegative or the positive side so so imean this is about the fact that whenyou want to deploy this when you want tohave this labeler system and practiceusually your users of the labeler iscompletely different from the so theymight be professional labelers so thinkabout this so when you put this onamazon mechanical terp right orcrowdsourcing platform so those labelersmade professional in terms of labelingbut they are not professional inunderstanding uh you know why they aredoing that right so this this is a thisis a difficulty part this is achallenging part you know compared toclassification uh compared to you knowthename entity recognition uh so thequestion of ranking right and how torepresent the ranking in a very niceintuitive ui and the worker canefficiently label that this is a stillthe question and this is i would saythis is still an open question i have toi checked a lot of uh you know opensource labeling system like label me uhthere is another labeling tools which isvery popular on github i checked thembut most of them they just they don'toptimizedirectly for search they optimize forclassification they provide forclassifications on the mainstream usecase it's still aboutimage annotation or image segmentationname entity recognition i believe therewill still need more attention moreresources to put into this uh searchlabeling tools yeahright that's so interesting and yeah ithink that's that is definitely aninterest different kind of labelingcompared to the programmatic labeling ofimage classification or named entitycompared up to just similarityannotation and then re-ranking it seemslike a hell of a task to annotateuh re-ranking orders so uh i was kind ofcoming out of the fine tuner bit and umi know that i think today as we'rerecording this uh there's theannouncement of gina three can you tellme a bit about what's new and then kindof what's on the horizon for gina andwhat things on your horizon are excitingyou the most yeah so i i think gina isreally what excites me most is about asupport uh on the cloud and and then wereally want to you know carry thepromise that we are the cloud nativeneural search framework right so we'reactually from the day one gina isdesigned in a very complicated microservice way which a lot of frameworkwon't do that in the first place aslet's say for example numpy won't dothat pandas data frames they won't dothat but gina from day one it isintroduced a lot of concept about aboutmicro service and now we we start toconverge into a point where say thatokay so now the design pattern has beenzero for a long time and now you canreally use gina as kind of the microservice framework for uh in productionright so this is a this is more like asymbol and then the the other thing whatmakes me very excited is about uhgina compared to one year ago or twoyears ago it has many friends alreadylike whether it is internal friends likedr ray feinhunder uh and uh you know thehub so it has all about the externalfriends so it already formulized uhformalized ecosystem right so the realpower is not it's not really about thegenome itself right we try to maximizethe productivity of gina userwith all the ecosystem so right now ifyou go to the readme right you read youryou go through the readme and youalready found out that okay so there area lot of things that it seems like it'snot really implemented inside gina butit's actually gina calling other serviceto do that right that some of thesurveys are internally some of thesurveys are externally and we are alsobuilding a synergy with viviet so wehaven't announced yet butfor the careful readers who you know goto our website go to a doc array websiteyou can already see that that there is astorage background called viviet youknow listed under the document storewhich enables people to use stock arraybut meanwhile enjoy the vector thefaster vector retrieval capability thatuh offered by vivian right so this isthe thing that i'm talking about so ginais not only it's not asolo fighter anymore it's kind of likeit's become the glue of the neuralsearch echo systemand this is actually what makes me veryvery excitedsuper cool yeah the integration withwe've we love the you know the storagethe vector and then plugging it intothis end to end gina i think it's such aperfect match of the glue andall these things fitting together sowell so i kind of have a meta questioni'm curious if what drives you'rethinking you'reso knowledgeable i've learned so muchfrom this chat and i'm really likeimpressed by how how much range of allthese topics you've been able to coverand i'm i'm curious like um how as youdevelop these things do you have aparticular application in mind that youpursue is like in your mind that likesomething that you'd like to see come tolife as like a builder of developertools in this kind of frameworkyeah yeah definitely i i would say fromfrom the beginning we focus on crossmodality and multi-modality search andwe're still pushing in that direction soour focus is always on cross-modalityand multi-modality uh solutions right solet's say we in the end we want tomake sure that you knowevery every time developers want torealize some cross-model and multi-modalcapability in their application theycome to gina right uh so that's ourlong-term vision and that's always myalways our vision right but in terms ofthe very uh you know practical solutionsuh real real-world applications i wouldsay right now it's still about text andimages right it's still about texting meimages videos you know we have somevideo partners but you know to be honestit's it's a little bit difficult becauseuh it's actually not about database it'sactually about computation andpre-processing the vector that the videosales is much more like say spacedemanding you know and also in terms ofnetwork uh you know it actually puts alot of pressure on the micro servicestructure right and uhuh so when it comes about text andimages i would say in terms of text iwould say uh what what what interestingask is the question answering this issomething thati mean if you talk about your researchon text right sothe first thing thatusually the investor will ask you isisn't this already done by elastic rightso you are doing a search and then youare doing search on text either this isalready done by elastic or blue scene orwhatever rightuh but then if you think about elasticor lucy they are able to do the tokenbased matching but they are not able todo the more deep semantic this kind ofrelation exploring things right and thenthe one very typical very goodapplicationin the textis a question answering especially thereading comprehension this kind of thingthis is something thatstill in the text domain right becauseeverybody loves text because the text islike a 70 of the all the data that wehave right andthen but this is something thatpreviously if you use elastic you useleucine this kind of symbolic searchtools you're not able to do thatit's very very hard to do that you canjustmimic some very simple intelligence butyou can easily beat up thoseintelligence right so nowadays with allthese machine learning deep learningmodels so qa is what definitely one oftheinterests when it comes to text in yoursearch and then when it comes to imageneural search i think the the old thingseverything is about the quality i meanneural image searchuh when you have whether you use neuralor non-neural right so you can use phaseto to do that uh it'syou if it's not a big topic it's not anew topic people realize peopleimplement that long times ago usingdifferent kind of heuristic hashingmeasures lisa shows this kind of thingbut now the thing is about the qualityit's the quality of this you know notonly the the quality of the search orthe ranking result but the quality theability of adjusting complicated imageslet's say hd images let's say 3d imagesright achieve all these kind of thingsright and uhcan we are we able to are we able tocome up with a solution over that over aperfect solution on this problem so thisis also and then there are also a lot ofumyou know to give you an example therewas a very interesting idea about uh youknowuh inside the company is about using anewer search to serve to to to solve thefront-end uh cicd problem so what isthis financial department so usuallywhen you write uhuh css or html right so you kind ofrender the page web page on top of thatbut sometimes you know you want tocompare this web page to the previousweb page to make sure that you are notuh introducing something very weirdlayouts that somehow mess up alleverything rightuh and so this is one thing that ofcourse you can you can use direct in uhyou know complete exact image mesh tocompare pixel by pixel uh but then inanother case you want to have kind ofvery general feeling about whether thislayout makes sense or not you know thiskind of thing compared to the previouslayout that you have i'll compare to thereasonable layout in a collection sothis is a very interesting neural searchproblemand then the search media is an imagebut it's a screenshot it's probably ascreenshot on multiple devices right oniphone on kind of like uh you know onthe on the on macbook pro you you havere or you know this kind of very highresolution uh screen or on windows whereyou don't have high resolution screen uhbut this kind ofthat do they all behave the same or dothey look like similar even thoughthey're you know they're kind of not inthe same shape uh so this is a this issomething uh that can beused or can be solved by a neural searchright so this is what i mean by imageand by image search we focus on qualityand innovation partyeah i love that idea ofthe text or the css to the userinterface and that kind of using deeplearning models on user interfaces ithink it's so exciting and this generalscope of like no code and deep learningto help with code is something that ithink is so interesting and so kind ofgoing out into some ideas that might bepossible and something that i'm reallycurious about is uh as you mentionedearlier say scientific literature miningapplications where you might highlight ayou're writing a paper and you highlightyour section you're like has anyone hadthis idea before you know you send thatto likethe archive or whatever yescan can text and the figures or theimages that describe algorithms andscientific papers do you think we'regetting close to being able to unifythose two things and and really have saymaybe an uh image captioning model trthat can caption a figure from a deeplearning paper or maybe a visualquestion answering can like could youexplain to me where in this imagex is described or something like thatyeah definitely i i know there is adirection called visual qa whichbasically you can ask image on questionsright so you can ask how many apples arein these images or what is a what is ageneral trend of this curve does it goon does it go down you know this kind ofthing uh so i i think it would be superpowerfuluh application if we can combine thiskind of multi modality scenes with qainto one solution right and uh i thinkby that time you know we want to makesure gina is ready for that right that'sthat's why you know gina is focused oncross modality multimodality try tospread over you know on differentdomains on different applications theonly reason is that you know we see thefieldof neural search is so wide right andthere are so many places so manymodalities and potentials in thisin this uh in this field right and wewant to get ready we want to make surethat we are ready as a developer toolswe are ready and before people realizingthat realizing there there is a need forthat right and when they when they whenthey realize that and they they can cometo gina and they use gina to buildsomething very quickly to solve theirproblem right like the problems that youwere talking about whether it's a textqa video qa table qa all these kind ofthings yeahyeah i love this i can imagine howrecently reading facebook's cm3 modelwhere they're they're modeling html textand then they take the images and theyput them into vq vae discrete codes ican imagine how you would have a vq vaepre-processing layer as an executor ongina hub and then you could grab thatplug it into your pipeline and thenyou've got the discrete codes to makeyour multimodalthingmore interesting and and yeah i thinkit's so interesting i'm really likereally impressed with the gina hub andthinking about how these modularcomponents again i really love themicroservices that you can query eachindividual component i think overallit's so interesting so uh thank you somuch for coming on the podcast han ithink we covered so many topics and ithink it'smaybe a lot for one person to digest allthese things but i'll be having achapter companion and things like thatto try to parse it but uh maybe kind ofjust wrapping up is there anything elsethat you think um maybe we left out inthe coverageuhyeah i think it's good i thinkeverything is covered yeah i mean i cankeep talking like a forever that's myjob that guy's the ceobut i think that's that's good yeahactually if i can't ask you one morequestion just um as the ceo what's beenyour experience building such a companylike thisuh i think it's uhthey'rei think there are a lot of to experiencei would say it's it's completely i ialways say that there are three types ofperson will work in the open sourcedomain one is you work as a hobbyistright so it's a it's not open source isjust your hobby so you have a daily jobuh working some companies and thenafterwards you you work in open sourceafter work your working opens upand then the second type of person ispeople who get very luckyin microsoft and google but then notonly in that in this company but alsoworking tensorflow team right workingfor pytorch right so this is also veryvery happy job right soboth of them both of them are kind ofvery happy becauseuh they don't have to worry aboutputting the bread on the table right sothat's that's the happy part right butthen what so there's third type ofperson it's just like a uh me and bobsowho i believe believing open source somuch that we are willing to create abusiness and we are willing we are soconfident that saying that okay so thisis not an ideology i ideal ideologyright so this is not about you knowhaving world peace uh not aboutsomething like that it's about creatingan economy right we are confident aboutthis kind of make money and so on rightand then we work on the open source wecreate this open source software as acompany right so what people call thecommercial open source companyand uh uh so then everything changedright so what previously become wellpreviously what's happening now is yeahit's uh it's occasionright okay it's happening and uh andthen everything that we work every movethat we have in the community on socialmedia it becomes very strategical rightso it's not so let's say some people saythat it's not so pure right because thenyou're kind of back with money you kindof like you know you want to adoptionthose kind of things it's not so pureanymore but hey after all you knowwesacrifice our time right so we use ourtime and effort and build up thiscommunity and offer this technology forfree i mean this is a spirit of opensource we we work with upstream we workwith downstream we help people you knowwe help the community to solve theirproblem in order to you know not onlyjust of course to promote our productbut also to improve the technology ofneural search right whether it is bob orit is me you know we share the same goalwe want to push this economy to the newhigh and then everybody gets you knowgets happy about this if we make thiscake biggerthen everybody's portion is also biggerrightof course we have to be very competitive[Music]you know you know then we get you knowequally bigger portion of the cake rightso that's that's all that's a happyhappy ending for everybody right so i ithink in general i would say it'scompletely different than when i work attencent i used to be a open sourcecontributor where i used to work attencent i was uhyou know i was aopen source program office i work inopen source program office i work as akind of like a technical manager thereto moderate the strategy of things inopen source how how they want to opensource the software especially in ai howto how they want to open the ai softwarein the linux foundation in the apachefoundation and now sitting as a ceo iseelet's say i'm seeing more realistic partof the open source it's not only aboutcollaboration synergy now from myunderstanding especially sitting as aceo as a company as an open sourcecompany open source means more aboutuh open competition right opencompetition it means that okay sowhatever vivian implement or whateverlet's say let's look at always talkabout let's use another uh imaginaryaccounting right so uhsowe we all the source code are open toeach other right so let's say today werelease gina screen and we have a verycool new features then you can alwaysadopt that you can always copy copypaste the code you know it is actuallyunlicensed online apache you can alwayscopy the copy paste the code and thenhave these functionalities in your codebase as well right so there's no problemat all rightbutuh so then it makes usto think about you knowusually in the software company sourcecode is your secret sauce it's whatmakes this company successful if thesource code is not your secret sauceanymore then what is your secret sauceright you must have something specialright to make this company sustainablerightuh you know warm heart you know thiskind of enthusiasm uh this don't takelong right those don't sustain you needsomething sustainable right to make surethat the company stays long rightespecially as open source software ibelieve every open source software uhcompany uh face the same challengeto keep retrospect to keep askingthemselveswhat is my advantage what is my mode ofthe company right in the end you have tomake money and uhso you do all these community thingssince can we translate this communitycontribution into kind of resources thatwe leverage to improve the adoptionright so those are the questions thatusually i believe every ceo of the opensource company well from time to timeasking themselveswow well thank you so much han i learnedso much from the podcast i'm so excitedfor our web community toto see this and i think there's so muchto learn from it so thank you so
