{"text": "You can now use Weaviate as the document store for DocumentArray in Jina AI. We had the pleasure to talk with their CEO Han ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nchecking out the 11th episode of the we \nva podcast today i'm joined with han \nxiao the ceo of gina ai gina ai is such \nan exciting end-to-end search pipeline \nsoftware and so i'm really excited to be \ntalking to han and learning more about \nthis so to kick things off han thank you \nso much for coming on the podcast and \ncould you tell us a bit about what gene \nis about \nhey connor thanks for having me and \nreally glad to talk to you and also to \nthe vivian community \nand uh yes sir my name is han i'm the \nfounder and ceo of gina ai and \nso gina ai is a very new company we \nfounded in february in 2020 during \npandemic and over the last year we have \nbeen building the new research our \npipelines the food stack solution uh \nincluding uh the framework itself but \nalso including the data structure the \nfine tuning uh and also the uh kind of \nmarketplace online right so that's \nthat's right now so right now we have 45 \npeople of the world our headquarter is \nbased is in berlin and right now i'm \nsitting in my burning office \nenjoying the ringing day here and uh you \nknow complaining about the weather \nand you know making pull requests right \nso that's that's kind of my daily work \nyeah i love learning about gina seeing \nuh the gina hub thing i thought was \nreally cool the fine tuner the doc array \nthe document executor flow and i'm \nreally excited to get into all these \nthings but quickly could you take me \ninto what inspired your interest to work \non uh say vector search and deep \nlearning for search and these kind of \napplications \nyes yes for sure uh so actually my \nlet's say my experience with new \nresearch uh back in the days we call it \na neural information retrieval starting \nfrom 2017 \nso when i worked at talento a german \ncompany \nwhich is a pretty big \nonline fashion retailer \nit's like a mini amazon uh but not so \nmany it's already one of the top 30 \ncompanies in germany uh you know but \nback in the days it was not so big right \nso \ni was working there uh \nand working on the especially at work \nfor the recommendation team working \ninside the recommendation team and later \ni worked i built up the searched uh you \nknow the search system uh uh behind \ntalento right and then uh when we work \nat when we build this search system in \nthailand because it's a more fashion \nrelated you know you will see a lot of \npictures patterns some addresses uh on \nshirts and so on you see people looking \nfor you know a very detailed patterns uh \non their on their dresses right so let's \nsay t-shirt with uh with some slo with \nsome slogan always certain logo i was a \nsuperman on it \nbut back in the days you know we have uh \nwe have uh for each article back in the \ndatabase we put some text you know \nmanually put some tasks to describe okay \nso what is this tag what is this article \nis about is the tag could be uh like a \nvisual based or it could be like uh i \nsay this this uh this shirt is made of \ncartoon it's made of a silk or whatever \nthis kind of things right uh it can be \nalso like a price tag a brand tag \nsometimes the tasks can only uh can also \ncontains typo so i i remember very \nclearly that uh when i brought the \narticle to catalog of the articles i see \nthere are intentionally a lot of typos \ninside the tag i asked the people why \nare they doing that and then the answer \nis because people search for those typos \nand then they want to heat the tables to \nthe articles they want to connect the \ntypos to articles so that's that was in \nthe days where you know deep learning \nwas not so evolved in the search system \nand people tried to associate the \narticle with the tags that is misspelled \nright and and then but the misspelling \nis one thing misspelling among all the \nnewer search problems is probably one of \nthe smallest things that uh you know \nthat we want to solve the most important \nas back in the day the most interesting \nthings is about how do you search \nthe uh the pattern like the the superman \non the t-shirt on the long-sleeve \nt-shirt uh a short sleeve t-shirt you \nknow connects these things to the \narticle by using image as a proxy right \nso that's that's kind of the key problem \nand then as you can imagine it is uh \nit's kind of cross modality cross model \nright so from text to image search but \nback in thailand it was uh more beyond \nthat the more interesting question is \ntalent although it is a german company \nis trying to provide service for 18 \ncountries in europe i remember very \nclearly because we want to support 18 \ndifferent languages right uh in in \nacross europe and then \nimagine that you build one text image \nmodel and you have to rebuild another \nmodel using query query to article this \ndata set and let's say we have a very \nsmall country that we operate in very \nsmall countries let's say in poland \nright so there are not so many german \nfans in poland and then the people you \nknow people don't use hilando there and \nuh uh so how do we want to build such \nmodel uh from from poland \ntheir language uh to the article because \nwe don't have this training date \nright so \none way so we're facing very serious uh \nlike this is this kind of code start \nproblem because we lack of training data \nif we want to if we ever want to build a \ntraining model from scratch \nso back in the day is my goal right my \nso i later work in thailand research and \nwe try to solve this two problem in one \nshot right \nthe two problem one is from text to \nimage the second is from multilingual \ntext \nto image right so try to solve this two \nproblem in one shot and then at the end \nwe come up with a new research pipeline \nuh let's say back in the days we call it \nthe deep learning \nretrieval pipeline uh which basically is \na very end-to-end solution and try to \nsolve try to combine these two problems \nin one big deep learning framework of \ncourse it's very competition demanding \nback in the days because there was no \nbirth model and everything has to be \nused \nbetween the rstm and uh \npeople were not very smart enough of \nconfidence enough of using this kind of \nuh you know attention since back in the \nday there was no thing as attention on \neverything rstm either rn or lcm and \nthen especially you want to add multiple \nlayers on top of rcm and then you want \nto build this rstm cnn it's like a \nfrankenstein you you put the rstmcn \ntogether \nit was terrible model but right in the \ndays you know this kind of terrible \nmodel is mainstream right \nin the market so that was the \nfirst start and we i published article \nabout talking about this the \nfrankenstein model uh i think in 2018 uh \nin january basically summarizing my work \nback in thailand and that that is the \ntime where i left as helena after three \nand a half years we worked with this \nfrankenstein model \ni left orlando and working at a chinese \ncompany \ncalled tencent it's very big one of the \nbiggest chinese internet company \nand mostly popular in east asia \nso back in tencent we have \na social app \nuh called wechat as you can imagine it's \nlike whatsapp but this is like a a mini \noperating system that inside your phone \nright because it can you can do a lot of \nthings you can do payment uh you can \nhave a party you can you can try you can \nbuy stock uh \ninside wechat you can do a lot of you \ncan also play games of course \nand uh uh so inside reach head we have a \nlot of we have also our our own kind of \nlike a facebook timeline so it's a mini \nsocial \nuh social social network it is a closed \nsocial network it's not like everybody \ncan view so you can only view other \npeople's timeline if you are the friends \nof the other people right \nand uh because it is a closed source \nit's not closer to because it is closed \necosystem then the content that you that \nyou publish there whether it is an image \nvideos audios the content you publish \nthere stays inside this ecosystem so \nthat means you cannot really google it \nfrom outside right because google can \ngoogle uh this uh \ncrawling boat they can not really touch \nthis close a closed system \nand then we have a very strong \nneed of searching those content how to \nhow to get those content out how to make \nthis content searchable and this \ncontents including the text the audios \nlike the auto snippet where you'll se \nyou you use it you send in the whatsapp \nright and also the videos uh images and \nso on right \nand also stickers emojis \nso now the requirement back in tencent \nwas how can we build an infrastructure \nthat can search all the kind of data \ntypes that we have right \nuh so tencent actually has this system \nwhich is built on top of elasticsearch \nright so and they \nthey actually they forked a very early \nversion of elasticsearch uh and they \nthey added a lot of plugins on top of \nthat \nuh i remember back in tension we have \nseven layers of plugins so the plugins \nhas its own plugins so we have in total \nseven layers of plugin it is \nunderstandable because tencent is super \nbig company and over years you gather \nlike a seven layers on on top of the \nelastic search and then \nso basically every plugin focus on very \nniche particular search use cases \nand then you know when i joined tencent \ni look at this another frankenstein you \nknow leaving from one of frankenstein \nand joining another function and look at \nthis architecture and then i did what \nevery engineer \nyou know would like to do is to first \nuh distract these things right so first \nto destroy the scenes and build another \nnew one right so uh and then i bring my \nknowledge license learner from talento \nand then try to try to use a completely \ndeep learning mindset and need to \nrestructure to refactor the uh the \narchitecture and then in 2019 we \nproposed a framework called generic \nneural elastic search genus which is you \ncan imagine it's like a father of gina \ntoday \nand the idea is really to \nvery radically using containerization \nmicroservices idea and wrap every step \nin the \nin the search pipeline to to separate \nevery step every step in the search \npipeline each one as a own microservice \nand then connect and then use a \ncontainer to wrap this microservice and \nfinally connect the dot dots to \norchestrate them together right so \nthat's kind of the you know a big shift \nfrom back in the days the elastic one is \na big monolith program by contention and \nnow we're shifting to a very radical \nmicro service \nuh architecture right and uh so that was \na \ngeneric neural elastic search so you can \nstill find this uh github repository \nonline but it's not really maintained \nthe sunset archived already uh but then \nwhen i work at tencent i you know i in \nlike working for this project for about \none year and then this project gets \ncancelled for the reason that they want \nto focus on video search right because \nback in the days there was a some very \nintense competition between tencent and \ntick tock uh basically it's a the \ncompany behind uh uh sorry the tick tock \nis a product and the company behind tick \ntock is called buy downs right back \ndowns and there was a serious very \nintensive competition between tencent \nand buy downs and then you know as a \nresult so the company decided to spend a \nlot of human resources in the video \nintelligence right they try to analyze \nvideos do some smart video \nrecommendations all these kind of things \nso instead of uh \ndoing what genus uh original vision is \nabout the original vision of gina of \ngenus is about \nbuilding a universal search engine for \nevery kind of data right so whether it's \ntext video sound audio 3d models and so \non right so that's that's kind of like a \nuh disappoint me uh disappoint me a \nlittle bit and therefore like uh after \nseeing through all the how the decisions \nyou know landscape all this open source \nmy my my interest in open source all \nthese kind of things and i decided to \nleave tens and i started to start this \ncompany right in 2020 uh january so \nthat's kind of the back story uh of gina \nand why \ni'm working in the new research today \nwell thank you so much that was such a \ncompelling back story and \ni love that frankenstein analogy i think \nthat really resonated with me is this \nidea of how we have all these different \ncomponents of these search pipelines and \nthe seven layers of plug-ins and the \nbackground on on your journey i really \nthought that was such a compelling \nbackstory so thank you so much for that \nso to kind of transition a little bit \nand to try to unpack this frankenstein \nuh could you explain to people what uh \nwhat make up these search pipelines what \nare the key components of them \nyeah so i i think the uh a lot of people \nwhen they first talk about neural search \nit seems that okay so it's not so it's \nnot so difficult it's just like you you \ncompute cosine distance and that's it \nright \nto be honest it is true right but \nproviding that you have a good \nrepresentation right \nthen you compute cosine distance right \nif you don't have good representations \nand you know computing whatever distance \nis minimized right \nuh and then so and then there's a bunch \nof people from machine learning just \nthink that okay so especially right \nafter birth right right in the age of \ntransfer learning that everybody knows \nthat okay representation is a key right \nso everything can be represented by a \nvector right so whether it's a vector uh \nimage to vector text vector whatever \nbirth this kind of things right this \nthis concept what actually this concept \nwas not there right back in 2000 \nor something like that so the only thing \nthat was popular back in the days was \nword to back \nwhich compared to today's this vector \nmodel is completely different scene \nright \na globe this kind of thing and right now \nglobal is only used for initialization \nit's like usa and you have final \nproducts it's just used as a \nneutralization right so it's a it's a \nhuge paradigm shift right but back in \nthe days there were two two big things \nabout \nenabling a good neural search is one is \nyou need to have a good representation \nso that requires a very strong machine \nlearning model right and then the second \nstep is uh \nyou need to have a good distance a \nfaster retrieval somehow you can compute \nthe distance similarity vector vector by \nvector vector by matrix and matrix by \nmatrix this kind of similarity \ncomputation has to be fast \nand then uh so basically it's \ncompetition and storage right \ncompetition and storage uh so \nmaps to today we have the machine \nlearning power and then the database \nright so \nthis is kind of the big two biggest \nconcept you know that can power that \nkind of like the two pillars of your \nsearch right uh \nbut uh if you zoom in into the pipeline \nyou found that okay so there \nwhen you of course these two pillars \nitself has a lot of lot of you know \ndetails demo in the details there are a \nlot of lot of details to to be \nimplemented right for example in the \nmetric uh in the in the database part \nyou know how do you store those things \nefficiently right uh how do you uh how \ndo you can you use something else rather \nthan euclidean distance for example okay \nyou know float 60 64 or flow 32 is just \ntoo space consuming can i just convert \neverything into integer or binary and \nthen still compute somehow this distance \nright or why does the distance must be \ncosine or euclidean or harming distance \ncan it be some distance that's learned \nby some models right so there are a lot \nof things that you can do \nwith with just the database part with \njust the vector retrieval \nand then on the on the machine learning \npart of course like a different modality \nhow to convert \nimage to vector text to vector audio to \nvector and most importantly how can you \nconnect the image and text right combine \nthe multi modality how can you cross the \nmodality to get a vector representation \nbut apart from that \nas i said devil in details right so \nthere is a \npreprocessing steps and a \npost-processing \nuh in the neural search pipeline uh for \nexample in the pre-processing step so \nlet's say you have a big picture and \nthis picture big picture contains a lot \nof very very complicated concepts so \nthere are a lot of objects in that \npicture right and then i have a search \nquery i have a i want to search for a \nvery simple object which is like a just \na single apple this my image my image \nquery my query image is just an apple \nbut then all the image that you have in \nthe database it's very super common it's \nlike a mcdonald's menu right it contains \na burger it contains a french fries it \ncontains uh cola all these kind of \nthings every every picture is a \nmcdonald's menu but then your query \nimage is just apple \nso you can immediately see that even \nthough you use the same model uh \nuh for representation the the \nthe vector representation the semantic \nbehind this vector representation is not \nreally \nuh symmetric right so this brings us to \nthe question like \nit's so so this brilliant bring \nmakes me think that you know you cannot \nreally expect one single model without \nany pre-processing just storing some \ndata it will give you some good \nembedding right so therefore uh \na very important step back in tencent is \nabout pre-processing like for example \nhow can we cut how can we segment the \nimage into different chunks a different \ngranularity right in order to get \nembedding a kind of a hierarchical \nembedding right \non the very uh you know on the very top \nlayer you have the overall bird view of \nhow you know kind of a birdview \nembedding and then you can segment it \nall the way to the bottom you get a very \nfine-grained granularity this kind of \nembedding to describe each object right \nso \nin the end one document whether it is an \nimage or text or a chapter of of book \nwill end up with not only one embedding \nbut a lot of embeddings right a group of \nembedded \nthen how do you match your query which \ncould be also a group of emails to \nanother group of embeddings right so \nthis is not simple cosine similarity and \nthen you can imagine that \nwhen we put the problem into this setup \nthe database is just a two it's a very \natomic operations to enable such \nretrieval but that is not enough \npre-processing is important to get the \ngraph to get the correct granularity uh \nto get the group so get the correct \ngroup of embeddings and but also the \npost-processing is also important you \nhave to aggregate the group of embedding \nscores the scores from different groups \nfrom different hierarchies you know to \ninto the final result right so this is a \nthis is just one simple example you know \nwhen it comes to the image search and \nthen you can imagine in the video search \nwhere you you have a video input video \nof like 45 minutes uh and then your \nsearch query your query video is just \nlike one or two seconds or it could be \nlike just a short video like what you \nsee what you agreed on uh tick tock so \nthat then you need a preprocessing step \nsuch as segmenting by shots right and \nthen combining the frames into shots and \nshortening the frames all these kind of \nheuristics \nin order to get a good search quality \nyou cannot expect that i threw a two or \nthree seconds video into the embedding \nmodel and then 45 minutes video into \ninto the same embedding model and the \nresult uh embedding would be somehow \ncomparable right so that's that's that's \nwhy you know in gina we focus on the \nfull stack on the end to end experience \nour final search quality not really on \nthe computation part not really on the \ndatabase part but on the fine on the \nfull stack uh you know experience of \nyour search \nall right so another great uh \ngreat cluster of information i learned a \nlot from that and i really like um \njust coming back to the beginning of \nwhat you said with uh with the \ncomputation the storage and in we've \neight we've \nexplored things like the h sw vector \nindex for having the centroids to speed \nup the search and we've explored binary \npassage retrieval for having the binary \nrepresentations of vectors so the two \nthings that we've seen a lot with the \nvva side on the vector database storage \nand so i i \nthought that pre-processing thing was so \ninteresting that added a lot a lot to my \nknowledge and so is this talking about \nusing say object detection models or \nsemantic segmentation models to to \nseparate the objects and then you have \nembedded so say you classify \nuh this is the basketball in the image \nand do you then have an embedding for \nthat basketball window and then \ncan you tell me a little bit more about \nthen how these embeddings are you \nmentioned it's hierarchically aggregated \ngive me a little more detail about how \nyou assemble these embeddings \nyeah so i i think see i think you're \ndefinitely right so this is a \nthe rough idea is about you know \ndecoupling con you know divide and \nconquer right divide and conquer and \nfinally you assemble all the scores \ntogether but when it comes to \napplications how do you ensemble them \nlike you usually want to put some weight \nyou you don't want to just sum up \neverything together you want to somehow \nput waste on the on the bottom layer and \nthen bubble this up to the top link \nright \nbut bubbles is up to the to the to the \noriginal document which is a the thing \nthat you want to search for right \nuh so uh so the installing strategy is \nactually highly correlated with your and \napplication right so let's say if i'm \ndoing \nto document search i just want to look \nfor reference right i just want to uh \ncopy paste a paragraph \nabstract into my search engine i want to \nlook for the you know \nwhat what are the other academic papers \nyou know have the same idea right i want \nto search for this \nthen you can see the query the \ngranularity of the query it's probably \none or two sentences but then the search \nresult is a full document right so they \nare on different granularity so the \nassembling procedure will probably go \nyou know all the way to the top to get \nto the full the full information of the \nfood document right in order to before \nit returns to user another thing is you \nstill have the same thing you still \ninput one or two sentences but it's \nabout describing a problem so let's say \nin the long document qa right \nyou ask a question about this long \ndocument and then it returns some \nanswers right and then in this case the \nanswer the return results it's just a \none or two sentences or sometimes it's \njust just a token right \none or two tokens right then you see the \ngranularity is somehow you know it's \neven smaller than your input granularity \nso the the final pre the pre-processing \nprocedure the pre-processing step and \nthe incentive step highly depends on how \ndo you want to what is your application \nis about but in the middle there are \nprobably some reusable building blocks \nthat you can use it regardless of the \napplication and that's actually inspired \nus to do gina hub right for example for \nthe two examples i talked about \ngiving abstract searching for academic \npapers and asking a question about \nacademic papers highlighting the result \nthese two applications share the same \nnatural language embedding model they \ncan share the same language language \nembedding model even though their final \nusage appearing would be would be \ncompletely different a user interaction \nwould be also become a completely \ndifferent one could be just the \ntraditional search box and the other \ncould be just a qa chatbot right \nand uh so in this case \nyou know \nas i said it's highly depends on your \nfinal application but \nbut that also means you know although it \ndepends on application but as a \nframework as something like we are we \ncall ourselves a framework company or \ninfrastructure company as a framework we \nwant to get ready for that we want to \nmake sure that user once user has this \nneed has this idea of you know breaking \ndown into different granularity and then \ncombining this up once they have this \nidea they can implement such ideas \nunder gina right so that's that's kind \nof if you zoom in to dock array and go \nto docker array website documentation \nwebsite you can see that the docu \ndocument which is uh like a primitive \ndata type in in gina in dark array \nare like in gina ecosystem it's actually \nnested and hierarchic \nit's recursive right so the document can \nsub document and subdocument can \ncontains its own sub document not only \non the vertical direction it is \nrecursive but it's also on the \nhorizontal direction so that means a \ndocument kind of has its own nearest \nneighbors a soft document that can have \nall can also has its own nearest \nneighbors so you can imagine this is \nbecomes a tree right so it's kind of a \nrecursive in both horizontal and also \nvertical directions so this gives a very \npowerful representation uh for user to \nrepresent a complicated object and \nallowing them to you know traverse over \nthis very complicated document uh \nbubbling up the scores assembling the \nscores very easy so that's kind of the \nidea of dockery and we actually found \nthis kind of pattern a long time before \nbut we just previously it was just part \nof gina and now we pull it out as a \nseparate project and then you know serve \nit as a common cornerstone for all of \nour products uh in our ecosystem \nso this doc ray is it kind of similar to \nhow you have like a json schema that can \nembed you you could put like you know \nanother dictionary within the kind of \npython dictionary data structure json \nthat kind of yes that kind of structure \nand can you tell me more about uh gina \nhub how do people contribute to it \nwhat's kind of the organization of it \nyeah so gina hub \ngina hubba is a very interesting story \nuh has a very interesting story so to be \nfrank uh we failed uh two times before \nthe scenes that you see today right so \ni'm i'm going to be very frankly right i \nmean marketplace like it's very obvious \nlike every \nuh you know not every not apple do \nnot apple to marketplace google also do \na marketplace right they have app store \nyou have google play which is like app \nstore marketplace \nit seems so obvious that a lot of \nsoftware company also like to do \nmarketplace right uh you know \nsome of the very popular open-source \ncompany also has a marketplace running \nand i believe you right now if you talk \nabout if you go to any uh ecosystem like \nwhether it is about your search or \ndatabase uh you know security they will \nall have their own marketplace so we \nalso observe that i will see that okay \nso everybody has marketplace it must be \nvery easy to do that it must be very \nobvious to do that right and then we \nstart with the first marketplace which \ncomes which is completely powered by \ngithub right because \nbecause you can abuse github by you know \nby putting by storing all your kind of \nalgorithm inside one repository so then \nyou have a kind of very \npoor man version of the uh of the hub \nthis is exactly what we did for the \nfirst project right \ni kind of have a collection of \nrepository in github repository in one \nsingle github repo right but later we \nfound out this doesn't scale because you \nknow you know everything does stick \ntogether is like you have a very small \nroom and there are 20 people \nin that you know there a lot of things a \nlot of conflict management development \nmanagement issues uh so this doesn't \nscale skills out right so this actually \nslows us down uh when we try to update \nsome something uh update some uh you \nknow some dependency all these kind of \nthings \nand then the second version is uh \nwe look at all the so that was the first \nuh \nfailure right back in i think this was \nback in the \nuh \nuh 2020 2020 in winter right we realized \nthat okay so this doesn't work right so \nuh you know we kind of put or we kind of \nuh you know \nuh suspend this project you know project \nlike forever right and \nin 2021 we restart this project because \nyou know everybody do marketplace we \nstill want to do marketplace you know we \nare one of the cool guys and we still \nwant to do marketplace and we think \nabout okay so \nuh we failed because of the you know \neverybody has to go to github github \nrepository and there's no very \ninteraction user engagement on that so \nlet's first let's focus on ui right so \nlet's first build a very nice graphic \nuser interface to attract people there \nand with car design bootstrap you know \nthis kind of uh \ncard things and and then \nthis version of cars also fails right so \nit fails because there is no \ninfrastructure that supports this \nmarketplace right \nso basically the infrastructure is not \nup to date it's still like a very \nrepulsory base and then you basically \nbuild a static website which somehow you \nhave some nice card and then link back \nto the github repository right this also \ndoesn't work and then i started to as \nthis failure was the second failure that \nhappens in \nuh summer 2021 i think in may 2010 \nsomething like that \nand as i start to think about this most \nseriously right i started to think about \nokay so what does it what has a \ncornerstone what are the pillars that \nmakes a good marketplace \nand uh \ni summarize as a three points right uh \nuh so it is just my personal opinions uh \nprobably some people don't agree on this \nso the first point is you need a good \ninfrastructure all right so think about \napp store right so you download an app \nfrom the app store from apple app store \nright \nit seems that you have the same download \nspeed whether you're locating in us or \nwhether you are in china or you're in \ngermany you have you basically have the \nsame download speed and every time the \napp is updated you get notified every \ntime your ios is updated then the \napps that requires to be updated updated \noutdated automatically the apps that are \nnot necessarily yet to be updated stay \non the same version \nso this is an infrastructure it is \nsomething that \nbelongs to this marketplace without this \ninfrastructure app store won't work \nright you won't receive push \nnotification you won't receive push \nupdate you won't \nyou know you won't get a lot of version \nconflict you know after the operating \nsystem operating updates and you get \nyour your apps cannot use anymore so the \nreason the fact that you don't observe \nthis from day to day is that apple \nimplements a very good infrastructure \nbehind their app store \nright so why do we care about this we \nhave the same problem we have a gina \nwhich is like the ios like the operating \nsystem \nand the executor which is like the \nreusable building block it's like the \napp on the app store so there are \nversion control issues there are updates \nissuers who updates first and who gets \nupdated what is the cost what is the \nconsequence and you know and all the \npush things right so you want to pull \nyou want to use executor inside gina and \nthen pull this and then pull and then \nyou want to encourage community to push \nit and then whether the developer has \ncertificate authentication all these \nkind of so this is infrastructure \nproblem right which support which \nbecomes the first successful factor of a \nmarketplace \nand then the second \nis the content right so let's say we \nbuild a very good infrastructure right \nbut nobody \nliterally nobody uh you know contributes \non that then this is also bad i think \nyou know right now one of the most \nsuccessful open source arp company in \nthe world has very successful and active \nmarketplace it's because a lot of \ncontributors a lot of people in this and \ncontribute very good uh content to that \nto give you a better example let's don't \ntalk about competitors right so let's \nlet's just use xbox right some people \nlike xbox some people like sony ps4 or \nps5 \nbut what matters let's say comparing \nside by side their graphic cards their \ncpu gpo this kind of thing you know \ncontroller \nyou can talk about this right you can \ncompare side by side but that's the \nnursing right so that's very nerdy \nuh what really matters is \nin this platform do you have their \nfavorite games here right do you have \nyour favorite games there \nuh \nnintendo 3ds right so there is a there \nis a there is a lot of like a very very \nuh you know it's very bad hardware right \nand but then you have a very good uh \nzelda right on this on this console \nright so that's why uh you know people \nplay that right and uh let's say if you \nhave a infrastructure that's of course \nnot enough you you have a marketplace \nyou need to have a good content you need \nto have sexy content that lure people in \nright and so people it is exclusive to \nthis platform right so let's say we have \na new bird model \nand this is first available in this \nmarketplace right then this is a this \nthis generates an impact that you know \nattracts people to your marketplace so \nthe content is the second successful \nfactor uh but also like a content is not \nreally it's it's really it's i mean it's \nvery easy to summarize like this but \nwhen you try to implement that it \nactually involves engineering effort \ndebris effort uh research effort \nbusiness developing effort a lot of \nthings right \nand then the third thing is social \na lot of people missing the social parts \nthe social pillars of the marketplace uh \nthis uh so think about this uh so i \nremember in the old days we have google \nchat or msn messenger right i mean they \nare not really like uh uh \nkind of like a really easy to use right \nespecially msn messenger a live \nmessenger microsoft live my center it's \nnot really easy to use but you still use \nthat because your friends using that \nright \nuh so this is a social factor of the \nmarketplace if we can make sure that \nyour friends your colleagues right your \nfriends in the data science community \nalso use the same platform right then \nthis is what makes the marketplace more \nactive \nso these are the three factors that i \neventually summarize you know before we \nstart the third version of gina hub and \nthis is the kind of the the gina hub \nthat you see today on the surface you \nsee okay there's a our cage interface \nthere and there is uh some some kind of \nuh contents there but underneath we have \na very very powerful infrastructure so \nwhat you see right now is just a \nvirtualization layer so you see a bunch \nof docker images there it looks like \nvery static but right now with gina 3 \nrelease so this each \nuh docker image there suddenly becomes a \ndarker container that is already running \nit is we call it sandbox so you can \ndirectly query it as a macro service you \ncan without even downloading without \neven pulling for your local right so \nthis basically suggests that \nbesides virtualization \npart which we are already \nhave a good computation layer under the \nhub right and then we have we have uh if \nyou if you read our documentations uh \nvery carefully uh very very closely \nyou'll find that there is a docker rate \npush and pull \nand this is actually the storage part of \nthe hub system so overall if you ask me \nwhat is what is my vision what is hub \nabout i would say hub is about \nthree pillars right now \nthe you know not easy um \nnow the the social you know \ninfrastructure these things but the \nthree pillars of \nuh \nvirtualization \ncomputation and storage so those are the \nthree pillars three layers of the hub \nsystem \nand that we have and \nthis well actually becomes the \nuh let's say this is the highlight of \nthe county in this year so we will spend \na lot of energy a lot of human resources \nin the hub and the hub will become the \nmiddleware of the camp all right so it \nwas support gina it was support fine \ntuner darquery and all the product all \nthe ecosystem that we have \nwow that's incredible i think that's \nsuch a \nthis is a great master class on the \nmarketplace and and the hub and all \nthese things can you take me through how \nthese \nsay modular components and i i love that \nmicro service so you can query it and it \ncan be independent and you can test it \nthat way i think that's so exciting \ncould you take me through uh i think \nit's uh document executor flow can you \ntake me through how you \nhow these things all plug together \nyes yes definitely so i think the uh the \ndocumentary executor and flow this three \nconcept has been zero uh let's say uh \nsince we first since we write the first \nline of the code right so we have we \nhave we actually have a lot of concepts \nright so we have \nwe have a lot of concept like a driver \nexecutor p pod a runtime uh zenflow so \nwe have like a we we used to have a \nfamily picture right and \nthere is a wait wait we actually plot we \nactually uh asked uh uh a a uh you know \na illustrator uh kind of like an \nillustrator and help us to draw some \ncartoon figure for each kind of uh \ncanton picture for each kind of figure \nfor each component that we have but then \nlater we murder everybody that we kind \nof refactor all the things that we kill \neverybody and then the only three \nleftovers are executors document a \ndocument executor and flow right so \nthat's the three concept that we \neventually realized that okay in order \nto let user to know about your search to \nuse your search these are the only three \nconcepts \nthat users need to know nothing more \nright \nbefore that we have the idea that okay \nso you know we are so awesome on \nengineering so we are so awesome \nso so uh so smooth and refactoring build \nall these abstractions since let's tell \nthe user about it but the user don't \ndon't buy it it's just like you sell \nthem a burger you only tell you'll only \ntalk about the meat you know this is a \nvacuum meet or whatever this very \npremium value you don't talk about \ncheese or pickles in the burger right so \ni i never see there is a burger company \nsaying that okay we use the best pickle \nbecause it's meaningless right so people \nonly care about the meat right \nor the best of bong or whatever there's \nsaid \nno one give a damn about this right so \nthat's that means that when you when you \ntry to build a product right you only \ntell the users the necessary part in \norder to satisfy them and then the \nnecessary part in the gina ecosystem \nwhat we say that is in your search \necosystem is document which describes \nthe objects the real world objects you \nwant to search or you want to index it \ncould be a pdf it could be an image \nvideo audio mp3 mp4 those kind of \nand then the executor executor is \nbasically like an algorithm uh \nespecially uh you know the algorithm \nunit of how you want to process this \ndocument uh the executor could be \nindexing could be bird could be storing \nor it could be pre-processing scoring \nall that kind of stuff \nand finally the flow the flow is kind of \nconnecting all the executors and puts \nthem together \nso the reason of using executor is uh \nit's actually uh \nmaking the original very local uh \norientated algorithm \nnetwork ready or cloud ready as a cloud \nready so basically uh by using executor \nyou cannot wrap your algorithm with a \nnetwork layer so that it becomes a kind \nof micro service that are ready for the \nflow to be connect with to orchestrate \nright and then the flow is a final \ncomposer of everything right so you can \nimagine i'm a flow i'm a composer i'm an \norchestrator so all the executors are \nsitting there and i just connect the \ndoors and then to accomplish certain \ntasks right so that's kind of the three \nconcepts that we eventually found you \nknow uh \nthat are really necessary for the end \nusers \nso when people push a micro service to \ngina hub is it wrapped in one of those \nlike they're either uploading an \nexecutor algorithm or an overall \norchestration \nis it one of those three things they're \npushing to the marketplace \nyes so right now you can so if you use \ndocument array push pull so you \nbasically you trigger the storage layer \nyou actually store your document array \non in the hub and if you push a executor \ninto the hub you basically uh it will \nactually build \nyour executor into a docker image into a \ndocker container and make it a service \nready right on the on the on the hub \nright so this is a this is your \nexperience on the whether you can deploy \nan end-to-end thing like a flow right \nnow or multiple executor or subfloor \nright a subfloor subfloor is also very \ninteresting right so let's say it's not \na single exerter can do these things but \nyou know let's say 2x heater can concat \ntogether you want to make it a subflow \nand you make it reusable in some other \ntasks this is also very interesting \nconcept but at this moment the hub is \nnot supporting subfloor or the flow \nlevel deployment or push-pull things \nright it only supports executor and \ndocument level push-pull yeah but as you \ncan see this is a very natural step that \nwe will work on uh in the next couple of \nmonths \nso say to come back to our earlier uh \nexample of where you're parsing an image \nfor to get out the different clothings \nwith say an object detection model would \nyou wrap that into a pre-processing \nexecutor and then you'd push that to the \ngina hub and that would be the \ncontribution yeah exactly exactly that's \nthe point yeah exactly very cool \nthat's super cool so so coming a little \nout of the end to end and a little back \nto the embeddings themselves i want to \nask you about the fine tuner library and \nthe things that are in it like the lost \nfunctions hard negative mining and uh \nand the general concept of say \noff-the-shelf embeddings versus these \nfine-tuned embeddings yeah yeah exactly \nso so this is a this is a scene that uh \nuh \nthis is another missing piece uh you \nknow when we \nuh but we actually to be honest we \ndidn't uh we didn't come up with this \nidea when we built a company let's say \nback in 2020 in february we don't have \nthis idea we didn't have this idea \nbut while we are developing or making \nsynergy building some prototype with our \nclients we found ourselves always stuck \nin the position where \nafter deployment after this thing is \ndone \nthere is no way to improve it further \nright we have seen him we have been \nseeing a lot of ways like you know hyper \nparameter optimizing you know uh using \nsome heuristics uh this kind of thing \nbut in the end what really matters is \nabout the embedding the representation \nwhether it is good enough for the \nranking problem right because it's not \nlike a classification it's not for \ngeneral representation it's for very \nspecific ranking right can you can you \nsort a before b right so that's the \nthat's that's the that's the idea right \nso we we always stuck there right we \nalways say that okay so at this point \nprobably you only need to rely you you \ncan only hope that google or open ai \ngives you a better model right \nuh \nso at some day last summer \ni i said that's enough right so we need \nto do something \nwe need to do something about this \nthis uh these embedding things about \nthis naughty embedding right and then \nsince october uh uh since august we have \nthis idea and then we spent two months \nto develop the first prototype and then \nwe published we released as a open \nsource package in october uh fine tuner \nin october so \nif you count the date by date so we are \nonly one month late than google so \ngoogle released such fine-tuning metric \nlearning tools \nback in 2021 \nin september and we released that in \n2021 in october right so that's that's \nuh that's that's basically show us how \nwe you know we look ahead in terms of \nthis marketplace so why i think this is \nnecessary why do i think this is \nimportant because i believe \nthe tools such as tensorflow or pi torch \nis not designed for fine tuning so you \nknow that in the transfer learning to \ngive you some background transfer \nlearning you know first uh \ntraining from scratch and then second \nyou'll you'll fine-tune something right \nso this is a this is usually a two-step \nprocedure \nand then \ntensorflow and paid torch or whatever \nthis other deep learning package they \nare very good at building a model from \nscratch where you need to write a \narchitecture a network architecture from \nscratch this is a completely different \nin the fine tuning usually you don't do \nsuch \nwriting \nlike a writing phone writing a big \nnetwork architecture in the fine tuning \nprocedure usually you just mask out some \nlayers uh usually you just add some \nlayers mask or some layers leveraging \nthe existing pre-trained weights and \nthen do some progressive learning right \nso this design pattern this usage \npattern is also different quite \ndifferent from you know from zero to one \nthings right so you can imagine you \nbreak down the whole procedure from zero \nto one and then from one to n right and \nthen this needs a two different kind of \ntwo kits or two twos right so uh so \nthat's why i believe uh you know i i'm \npretty sure that a lot of people using \ntensorflow or pytorch for fine tuning \nbut i don't believe this is the right \ntools for finding i believe we need a \ndifferent tools which is very good at \nmasking out or selecting which can be \nfine-tuned in the network architecture \ncan be very smoothly integrate human \nfeedback \nin the fine-tuning procedure because \nthis is super supervision and \nand also of course bring the best \nquality right out of that so based on \nthis consideration so if you look at the \ninitial uh you know concept of fine \ntuners that we have it actually composed \nof three components uh the trainer of \ncourse is uh you know training all these \nthings and the tailor uh tailor is uh \nyou know you can mask out some of the \nlayers or you decide to you know add \nsome layers on top of that usually are \nlinear layers as back as a as \nas a as the end or you can freeze \ncertain layers right \nand finally uh the labeler right so a \nlabeler is allowing people users to uh \ninteractively label the wrong data and \nin the next iteration it triggers some \nactive learning you know selects the \nnext hard examples and then uh tells the \nuser to label uh you know to improve the \ntraining efficiency right so the tailor \ntrainer and labeler right so that's the \nthree original concept uh uh components \nin the fine tune \nand uh i still believe that this is this \nis very true that you know in this age a \nlot of you are seeing more and more \ncompany focus instead of focusing on \ntraining from scratch right \nthere's still companies like focus on \ntraining from scratch but then i'm \nexpecting that more and more company \nfrom this year you know they will start \nto developing tools developing surveys \nfor \nfine tuning right because training from \nscratch is not really doable by a lot of \ncompanies whether it is \nyou know time wise or money wise you \ndon't you have to spend a lot of talents \nresources money uh gpu right electricity \nyou know build on training something \nfrom scratch but the fine tuner is \ndifferent right you you don't want to \nspend a lot of effort you want to \noptimize the time to market right \nand then the the training from scratch \npart is not part of the time to market \nthe fine tuning who can ever provide the \nbest fine tuning uh who can win the time \nto market part \nsuper interesting and i really want to \nask also about your view on prompting \nversus fine tuning next but then just to \nquickly unpack these things a little bit \ni really liked your description of the \ntaylor part i think that's so \ninteresting say the lottery ticket \nhypothesis how we know that there's this \nsparse sub network within the dense \narchitecture that can retain the full \nperformance but there isn't really a \ngood masking interface as you say to \nimplement that masking and pie torch or \ntensorflow bit of a headache you got \nyourself in yeah exact things we've \nand things we've seen with say the \nadapter and compactor layers a recent \npaper vision and language adapter \nthey're able to fine tune they only need \nfour four point four percent of the \noriginal clip parameters to fine tune it \nbecause what they're doing is they have \nthese intermediate layers that they \nfine-tune they don't fine-tune the whole \nnetwork architecture so as han's \ndescribing this tailor part is such an \ninteresting part and so i think we'll \ncome back to the labeler part i wanted \nto ask you a little more about that but \nto kind of stay on this topic of tuning \ngenerally um what are your thoughts on \nsay prompting large models compared to \nfine-tuning them \nyeah i i i know this uh so i know the \nproblem to you this kind of thing is \nvery uh becomes very uh let's say a lot \nof attention uh in the especially in \nthese years i think it's super i think \nit's super useful like i i we i remember \nthere was a recent paper about the mask \nauto encoder which is kind of like a \nprompting and then in the region part i \nthink this idea is very \nuh it's very related to fine tuning but \nthen people people really now even talk \nabout you know in the fine tuning can we \neven skip the labeling part can we just \nrely on self learning can we self \nlearning can we just leverage the \nredundancy of the data itself and then \nuse it for fine-tuning including problem \nhere is one part mask auto encoder is \nanother technology but also like \naugmentation i think this is these \nthings are very very related and we \nactually have we actually plan to have \nall of them in the fine tuning framework \nyeah i see that as a part of the search \nlike because the way you can ensemble \nall the outputs with the different \nprompt in the like test time data \naugmentation and that kind of thing so \nso coming back into the components of \nthe fine tuner could you tell me about \nthe labeler a little more you mentioned \nthe active learning where you say bubble \nup the most uncertain predictions to \nsave for labeling but is this with \nrespect to similarity labeling with \nrespect to like say triplet losses where \nyou're saying these are similar this is \na hard negative or something like that \nand and if so when you're labeling base \nand similarity do you kind of have like \nuh like a a similarity graph where if \ntwo things are similar well it's like \nit's also similar to that other thing \nyou labeled it right so how do you kind \nof organize \nannotation of \ncontrast of learning models \nyeah exactly so so there there are two \nquestions so one is uh \nlike what to label right so whether you \nselect the most confident one and tell \nthe model is very confident they say \nokay so i'm pretty sure that this is the \ncorrect prediction and then you give it \na bump you say that no this is not \ncorrect are you you're telling the model \nto return the most unconfident one right \nso the model is yeah i'm not so sure \nplease help me human rights so either \neither way this could work right so i i \nremember you know my phd was actually \nabout adversarial learning it's about \nselecting the example that can ruin the \nwhole thing right so this is like the \nvery \nvery deconstructive part right so uh but \nbut i so there i i learned a lot of \nmodels a lot of measured about how to \nselect uh the examples uh you know there \nthere are a lot of a lot of measured a \nlot of lot of like a family of measures \nso some are based on the uh you know by \nspace based on the uh \ni remember when i work on that it's \nmostly about labeling for svm so there \nis like a margin based approach and then \nas people select the the data points \nthat are very close to the margin are \nvery far away from the margin \nin order to do that right so there is \nalso related somehow related to the uh \nrandom procedure a random process like a \ngaussian process so for each data point \nyou have kind of like a confidence \ninterval and then you kind of use this \nconfidence interval as a kind of the \nmetric to ask a human to labor right so \nthis is one thing i think there is no \nvery deterministic conclusion on this \nright a very very uh very very certain \nconclusion on this uh so that's why in \nthe in this framework we try to provide \nthe mainstream one right so those are \nall this mainstream one and then the \nsecond problem is actually more \ninteresting right uh i believe you see \nthe spacey have a nice very nice \nlabeling tools uh which called i forgot \ntheir name is a guy i think it's a \nparody or something like that \nand uh it has very nice ui i i really \nlike it i actually learned it a lot \nfrom when i do the fine tuner \nlabelers interface \nbut then it is different like in spaces \nuh \nspace is an nrp company by the way so \nit's a focus on text processing all this \nkind of thing in spaces labeler they try \nto label the name entity so it's mostly \nlike uh \nyou know you highlight some part of the \ntext and then you label with some \nentities but in ranking it is different \nright so how many results you want to \ngive to the user how how do you want to \nrepresent the relationship between you \nknow it's a kind of older relationship \nvery you want to represent it very \nnicely to the labeler \nand uh asking them to label it you know \nvery efficiently because usually when i \ndesign the label interface this involves \ntwo parts so one is for the developer \nfor the machine learning expert you know \nusually who's sitting behind the labeler \nwho will try to guide the algorithm to \npause it pose a question to the labeler \nso those people you have to make sure \nthat the graphic user interface makes \nsense for them makes sense from the \nmachine learning perspective you know \nyou are asking the right question and \nthen you you your user interface is not \nmisleading the labeler to give you the \nwrong answer right so this is one part \nright and then the second part is \nprobably more dark than your thought is \nthat you have to make your interface \nvery efficient for labeler \nyou you don't want to you don't want to \nintroduce a lot of video concepts you \nknow a lot of uh you know a lot of uh \nvery visual visual studios to distract \nthem you don't want to introduce very \ncomplete concept that labeler cannot \nreally understand what you know how to \nchoice or let's say for you for example \nuh you know i i i \npreviously saw there is a user interface \nasking the labeler to drag and drop you \nknow to drag a scroll bar to select uh \nto to raise \nhow related \nwhich is you know it's like a i would \nnever go for like uh in the middle right \nso \ni will just go either on the on the \nnegative or the positive side so so i \nmean this is about the fact that when \nyou want to deploy this when you want to \nhave this labeler system and practice \nusually your users of the labeler is \ncompletely different from the so they \nmight be professional labelers so think \nabout this so when you put this on \namazon mechanical terp right or \ncrowdsourcing platform so those labelers \nmade professional in terms of labeling \nbut they are not professional in \nunderstanding uh you know why they are \ndoing that right so this this is a this \nis a difficulty part this is a \nchallenging part you know compared to \nclassification uh compared to you know \nthe \nname entity recognition uh so the \nquestion of ranking right and how to \nrepresent the ranking in a very nice \nintuitive ui and the worker can \nefficiently label that this is a still \nthe question and this is i would say \nthis is still an open question i have to \ni checked a lot of uh you know open \nsource labeling system like label me uh \nthere is another labeling tools which is \nvery popular on github i checked them \nbut most of them they just they don't \noptimize \ndirectly for search they optimize for \nclassification they provide for \nclassifications on the mainstream use \ncase it's still about \nimage annotation or image segmentation \nname entity recognition i believe there \nwill still need more attention more \nresources to put into this uh search \nlabeling tools yeah \nright that's so interesting and yeah i \nthink that's that is definitely an \ninterest different kind of labeling \ncompared to the programmatic labeling of \nimage classification or named entity \ncompared up to just similarity \nannotation and then re-ranking it seems \nlike a hell of a task to annotate \nuh re-ranking orders so uh i was kind of \ncoming out of the fine tuner bit and um \ni know that i think today as we're \nrecording this uh there's the \nannouncement of gina three can you tell \nme a bit about what's new and then kind \nof what's on the horizon for gina and \nwhat things on your horizon are exciting \nyou the most yeah so i i think gina is \nreally what excites me most is about a \nsupport uh on the cloud and and then we \nreally want to you know carry the \npromise that we are the cloud native \nneural search framework right so we're \nactually from the day one gina is \ndesigned in a very complicated micro \nservice way which a lot of framework \nwon't do that in the first place as \nlet's say for example numpy won't do \nthat pandas data frames they won't do \nthat but gina from day one it is \nintroduced a lot of concept about about \nmicro service and now we we start to \nconverge into a point where say that \nokay so now the design pattern has been \nzero for a long time and now you can \nreally use gina as kind of the micro \nservice framework for uh in production \nright so this is a this is more like a \nsymbol and then the the other thing what \nmakes me very excited is about uh \ngina compared to one year ago or two \nyears ago it has many friends already \nlike whether it is internal friends like \ndr ray feinhunder uh and uh you know the \nhub so it has all about the external \nfriends so it already formulized uh \nformalized ecosystem right so the real \npower is not it's not really about the \ngenome itself right we try to maximize \nthe productivity of gina user \nwith all the ecosystem so right now if \nyou go to the readme right you read your \nyou go through the readme and you \nalready found out that okay so there are \na lot of things that it seems like it's \nnot really implemented inside gina but \nit's actually gina calling other service \nto do that right that some of the \nsurveys are internally some of the \nsurveys are externally and we are also \nbuilding a synergy with viviet so we \nhaven't announced yet but \nfor the careful readers who you know go \nto our website go to a doc array website \nyou can already see that that there is a \nstorage background called viviet you \nknow listed under the document store \nwhich enables people to use stock array \nbut meanwhile enjoy the vector the \nfaster vector retrieval capability that \nuh offered by vivian right so this is \nthe thing that i'm talking about so gina \nis not only it's not a \nsolo fighter anymore it's kind of like \nit's become the glue of the neural \nsearch echo system \nand this is actually what makes me very \nvery excited \nsuper cool yeah the integration with \nwe've we love the you know the storage \nthe vector and then plugging it into \nthis end to end gina i think it's such a \nperfect match of the glue and \nall these things fitting together so \nwell so i kind of have a meta question \ni'm curious if what drives you're \nthinking you're \nso knowledgeable i've learned so much \nfrom this chat and i'm really like \nimpressed by how how much range of all \nthese topics you've been able to cover \nand i'm i'm curious like um how as you \ndevelop these things do you have a \nparticular application in mind that you \npursue is like in your mind that like \nsomething that you'd like to see come to \nlife as like a builder of developer \ntools in this kind of framework \nyeah yeah definitely i i would say from \nfrom the beginning we focus on cross \nmodality and multi-modality search and \nwe're still pushing in that direction so \nour focus is always on cross-modality \nand multi-modality uh solutions right so \nlet's say we in the end we want to \nmake sure that you know \nevery every time developers want to \nrealize some cross-model and multi-modal \ncapability in their application they \ncome to gina right uh so that's our \nlong-term vision and that's always my \nalways our vision right but in terms of \nthe very uh you know practical solutions \nuh real real-world applications i would \nsay right now it's still about text and \nimages right it's still about texting me \nimages videos you know we have some \nvideo partners but you know to be honest \nit's it's a little bit difficult because \nuh it's actually not about database it's \nactually about computation and \npre-processing the vector that the video \nsales is much more like say space \ndemanding you know and also in terms of \nnetwork uh you know it actually puts a \nlot of pressure on the micro service \nstructure right and uh \nuh so when it comes about text and \nimages i would say in terms of text i \nwould say uh what what what interesting \nask is the question answering this is \nsomething that \ni mean if you talk about your research \non text right so \nthe first thing that \nusually the investor will ask you is \nisn't this already done by elastic right \nso you are doing a search and then you \nare doing search on text either this is \nalready done by elastic or blue scene or \nwhatever right \nuh but then if you think about elastic \nor lucy they are able to do the token \nbased matching but they are not able to \ndo the more deep semantic this kind of \nrelation exploring things right and then \nthe one very typical very good \napplication \nin the text \nis a question answering especially the \nreading comprehension this kind of thing \nthis is something that \nstill in the text domain right because \neverybody loves text because the text is \nlike a 70 of the all the data that we \nhave right and \nthen but this is something that \npreviously if you use elastic you use \nleucine this kind of symbolic search \ntools you're not able to do that \nit's very very hard to do that you can \njust \nmimic some very simple intelligence but \nyou can easily beat up those \nintelligence right so nowadays with all \nthese machine learning deep learning \nmodels so qa is what definitely one of \nthe \ninterests when it comes to text in your \nsearch and then when it comes to image \nneural search i think the the old things \neverything is about the quality i mean \nneural image search \nuh when you have whether you use neural \nor non-neural right so you can use phase \nto to do that uh it's \nyou if it's not a big topic it's not a \nnew topic people realize people \nimplement that long times ago using \ndifferent kind of heuristic hashing \nmeasures lisa shows this kind of thing \nbut now the thing is about the quality \nit's the quality of this you know not \nonly the the quality of the search or \nthe ranking result but the quality the \nability of adjusting complicated images \nlet's say hd images let's say 3d images \nright achieve all these kind of things \nright and uh \ncan we are we able to are we able to \ncome up with a solution over that over a \nperfect solution on this problem so this \nis also and then there are also a lot of \num \nyou know to give you an example there \nwas a very interesting idea about uh you \nknow \nuh inside the company is about using a \nnewer search to serve to to to solve the \nfront-end uh cicd problem so what is \nthis financial department so usually \nwhen you write uh \nuh css or html right so you kind of \nrender the page web page on top of that \nbut sometimes you know you want to \ncompare this web page to the previous \nweb page to make sure that you are not \nuh introducing something very weird \nlayouts that somehow mess up all \neverything right \nuh and so this is one thing that of \ncourse you can you can use direct in uh \nyou know complete exact image mesh to \ncompare pixel by pixel uh but then in \nanother case you want to have kind of \nvery general feeling about whether this \nlayout makes sense or not you know this \nkind of thing compared to the previous \nlayout that you have i'll compare to the \nreasonable layout in a collection so \nthis is a very interesting neural search \nproblem \nand then the search media is an image \nbut it's a screenshot it's probably a \nscreenshot on multiple devices right on \niphone on kind of like uh you know on \nthe on the on macbook pro you you have \nre or you know this kind of very high \nresolution uh screen or on windows where \nyou don't have high resolution screen uh \nbut this kind of \nthat do they all behave the same or do \nthey look like similar even though \nthey're you know they're kind of not in \nthe same shape uh so this is a this is \nsomething uh that can be \nused or can be solved by a neural search \nright so this is what i mean by image \nand by image search we focus on quality \nand innovation part \nyeah i love that idea of \nthe text or the css to the user \ninterface and that kind of using deep \nlearning models on user interfaces i \nthink it's so exciting and this general \nscope of like no code and deep learning \nto help with code is something that i \nthink is so interesting and so kind of \ngoing out into some ideas that might be \npossible and something that i'm really \ncurious about is uh as you mentioned \nearlier say scientific literature mining \napplications where you might highlight a \nyou're writing a paper and you highlight \nyour section you're like has anyone had \nthis idea before you know you send that \nto like \nthe archive or whatever yes \ncan can text and the figures or the \nimages that describe algorithms and \nscientific papers do you think we're \ngetting close to being able to unify \nthose two things and and really have say \nmaybe an uh image captioning model tr \nthat can caption a figure from a deep \nlearning paper or maybe a visual \nquestion answering can like could you \nexplain to me where in this image \nx is described or something like that \nyeah definitely i i know there is a \ndirection called visual qa which \nbasically you can ask image on questions \nright so you can ask how many apples are \nin these images or what is a what is a \ngeneral trend of this curve does it go \non does it go down you know this kind of \nthing uh so i i think it would be super \npowerful \nuh application if we can combine this \nkind of multi modality scenes with qa \ninto one solution right and uh i think \nby that time you know we want to make \nsure gina is ready for that right that's \nthat's why you know gina is focused on \ncross modality multimodality try to \nspread over you know on different \ndomains on different applications the \nonly reason is that you know we see the \nfield \nof neural search is so wide right and \nthere are so many places so many \nmodalities and potentials in this \nin this uh in this field right and we \nwant to get ready we want to make sure \nthat we are ready as a developer tools \nwe are ready and before people realizing \nthat realizing there there is a need for \nthat right and when they when they when \nthey realize that and they they can come \nto gina and they use gina to build \nsomething very quickly to solve their \nproblem right like the problems that you \nwere talking about whether it's a text \nqa video qa table qa all these kind of \nthings yeah \nyeah i love this i can imagine how \nrecently reading facebook's cm3 model \nwhere they're they're modeling html text \nand then they take the images and they \nput them into vq vae discrete codes i \ncan imagine how you would have a vq vae \npre-processing layer as an executor on \ngina hub and then you could grab that \nplug it into your pipeline and then \nyou've got the discrete codes to make \nyour multimodal \nthing \nmore interesting and and yeah i think \nit's so interesting i'm really like \nreally impressed with the gina hub and \nthinking about how these modular \ncomponents again i really love the \nmicroservices that you can query each \nindividual component i think overall \nit's so interesting so uh thank you so \nmuch for coming on the podcast han i \nthink we covered so many topics and i \nthink it's \nmaybe a lot for one person to digest all \nthese things but i'll be having a \nchapter companion and things like that \nto try to parse it but uh maybe kind of \njust wrapping up is there anything else \nthat you think um maybe we left out in \nthe coverage \nuh \nyeah i think it's good i think \neverything is covered yeah i mean i can \nkeep talking like a forever that's my \njob that guy's the ceo \nbut i think that's that's good yeah \nactually if i can't ask you one more \nquestion just um as the ceo what's been \nyour experience building such a company \nlike this \nuh i think it's uh \nthey're \ni think there are a lot of to experience \ni would say it's it's completely i i \nalways say that there are three types of \nperson will work in the open source \ndomain one is you work as a hobbyist \nright so it's a it's not open source is \njust your hobby so you have a daily job \nuh working some companies and then \nafterwards you you work in open source \nafter work your working opens up \nand then the second type of person is \npeople who get very lucky \nin microsoft and google but then not \nonly in that in this company but also \nworking tensorflow team right working \nfor pytorch right so this is also very \nvery happy job right so \nboth of them both of them are kind of \nvery happy because \nuh they don't have to worry about \nputting the bread on the table right so \nthat's that's the happy part right but \nthen what so there's third type of \nperson it's just like a uh me and bob \nso \nwho i believe believing open source so \nmuch that we are willing to create a \nbusiness and we are willing we are so \nconfident that saying that okay so this \nis not an ideology i ideal ideology \nright so this is not about you know \nhaving world peace uh not about \nsomething like that it's about creating \nan economy right we are confident about \nthis kind of make money and so on right \nand then we work on the open source we \ncreate this open source software as a \ncompany right so what people call the \ncommercial open source company \nand uh uh so then everything changed \nright so what previously become well \npreviously what's happening now is yeah \nit's uh it's occasion \nright okay it's happening and uh and \nthen everything that we work every move \nthat we have in the community on social \nmedia it becomes very strategical right \nso it's not so let's say some people say \nthat it's not so pure right because then \nyou're kind of back with money you kind \nof like you know you want to adoption \nthose kind of things it's not so pure \nanymore but hey after all you know \nwe \nsacrifice our time right so we use our \ntime and effort and build up this \ncommunity and offer this technology for \nfree i mean this is a spirit of open \nsource we we work with upstream we work \nwith downstream we help people you know \nwe help the community to solve their \nproblem in order to you know not only \njust of course to promote our product \nbut also to improve the technology of \nneural search right whether it is bob or \nit is me you know we share the same goal \nwe want to push this economy to the new \nhigh and then everybody gets you know \ngets happy about this if we make this \ncake bigger \nthen everybody's portion is also bigger \nright \nof course we have to be very competitive \n[Music] \nyou know you know then we get you know \nequally bigger portion of the cake right \nso that's that's all that's a happy \nhappy ending for everybody right so i i \nthink in general i would say it's \ncompletely different than when i work at \ntencent i used to be a open source \ncontributor where i used to work at \ntencent i was uh \nyou know i was a \nopen source program office i work in \nopen source program office i work as a \nkind of like a technical manager there \nto moderate the strategy of things in \nopen source how how they want to open \nsource the software especially in ai how \nto how they want to open the ai software \nin the linux foundation in the apache \nfoundation and now sitting as a ceo i \nsee \nlet's say i'm seeing more realistic part \nof the open source it's not only about \ncollaboration synergy now from my \nunderstanding especially sitting as a \nceo as a company as an open source \ncompany open source means more about \nuh open competition right open \ncompetition it means that okay so \nwhatever vivian implement or whatever \nlet's say let's look at always talk \nabout let's use another uh imaginary \naccounting right so uh \nso \nwe we all the source code are open to \neach other right so let's say today we \nrelease gina screen and we have a very \ncool new features then you can always \nadopt that you can always copy copy \npaste the code you know it is actually \nunlicensed online apache you can always \ncopy the copy paste the code and then \nhave these functionalities in your code \nbase as well right so there's no problem \nat all right \nbut \nuh so then it makes us \nto think about you know \nusually in the software company source \ncode is your secret sauce it's what \nmakes this company successful if the \nsource code is not your secret sauce \nanymore then what is your secret sauce \nright you must have something special \nright to make this company sustainable \nright \nuh you know warm heart you know this \nkind of enthusiasm uh this don't take \nlong right those don't sustain you need \nsomething sustainable right to make sure \nthat the company stays long right \nespecially as open source software i \nbelieve every open source software uh \ncompany uh face the same challenge \nto keep retrospect to keep asking \nthemselves \nwhat is my advantage what is my mode of \nthe company right in the end you have to \nmake money and uh \nso you do all these community things \nsince can we translate this community \ncontribution into kind of resources that \nwe leverage to improve the adoption \nright so those are the questions that \nusually i believe every ceo of the open \nsource company well from time to time \nasking themselves \nwow well thank you so much han i learned \nso much from the podcast i'm so excited \nfor our web community to \nto see this and i think there's so much \nto learn from it so thank you so much \nagain \nyeah sure \n[Music] \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Podcast #11: CEO Han Xiao from Jina AI", "path": "", "link":
