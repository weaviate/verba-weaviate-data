{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the 36th episode of the Weaviate podcast! This episode continues on the ... \nhey everyone I'm super excited about \nthis week podcast we have Lang chain \nfounder Harrison Chase and we've yet CEO \nand co-founder Bob Van light so guys \nthanks so much for joining the podcast \nthanks man looking forward to this \nconversation thanks for having me guys \nreally excited to be here awesome well \nI'm just so excited to dive into it \nHarrison could we start with the story \nof like the origin story of Lang chain \nlike how you created this yeah I mean it \nstarted really uh kind of \ninnocently and innocuously I was just \nchatting with the so you know everyone's \ninto language models these days \neveryone's building applications and and \nso when I first started chatting with \nfolks and this is back in like \num September October people were still \ninto it not to the extent they are today \nbut there was a lot of people playing \naround and messing around and building \napplications \num and I chatted with a bunch of them at \nmeetups I had some friends \num building stuff Sam Whitmore uh shout \nout to her was building an awesome \napplication and so really got to like \nknow them and chat with them about their \nuse cases \num and basically just saw like a few \ncommon kind of like abstractions things \nthat were happening factored those out \nput those in a python package very kind \nof like just engineer you know Factor \nstuff out put it in there and put it out \nthere \num put it out to the world and and got \nuh got a positive response and so kept \non adding stuff in kept on refactoring \nas you know the the abstractions that I \nthought I first saw were of course wrong \nand so those kind of like evolved over \ntime \num but yeah basically just started off \nby chatting with a bunch of folks and \npulling out comments distractions into a \npython package \nbrilliant maybe so we could start with \nkind of maybe the first abstraction that \nhelped me understand link chain was kind \nof the sequential chains like you know \nyou have the output of the language \nmodel is the input to the next call to \nthe language model could maybe start \nwith describing the sequential chains \nyeah absolutely I think so the the idea \nof chaining is basically breaking up \ncalls to language models and in multiple \nsteps \num and not only call us the language \nmodels but to other things actually and \nso I think actually most of the examples \nthat I first added were like language \nmodel and then other thing and then \nlanguage model and basically chaining \nthe results of them together in a way \nwhere you can you you did some iterative \nstuff and so to make this concrete with \nan example one of one of the things that \nI first added was based on a paper by \noffer press self ask with search so \nbasically you'd ask a question and and \nthe examples in this paper were kind of \nlike multi-hop questions so it wasn't \njust like a simple answer and these are \ncases where language models are known to \nkind of like not perform Super well \num and so the self ask with search \nParadigm is you first kind of like think \nabout what intermediate questions you \nneed to answer so \nI think like uh the the the example used \nin the paper is like what is the \nhometown of the current U.S open \nchampion and so like if we're if we're \nthinking about that intuitively like \nwhat would we do as humans first we'd \nthink about who who the current U.S open \nChampion is \num and then would figure out where his \nhometown is and so basically the idea of \ntraining was was to break those down \ninto exactly those steps so the language \nmodel should hopefully know that it \nfirst needs to think about who the \ncurrent U.S open Champion is figure that \nout and then it needs to think about \num where he's from and and figure that \nout and uh you could do that with uh you \ncould do that with a single pass of a \nlanguage model the the thing that's um \nthe thing that's interesting and the \nthing that caught my attention was \nbasically the idea of combining the \nlanguage model with Google search \nbecause if you're asking about the \ncurrent US Open Champion the language \nmodel who's trained on data up to 2021 \nor something like that wouldn't know the \ninformation and so basically using \nlanguage model to ask the intermediate \nquestion you then pass that question to \na search API you get back a result and \nthen you basically keep on going from \nthere and so the the idea of chaining \nthat really stuck out and this is a \nlittle bit different than the sequential \nchains that you brought up but I think \nit's uh I think it's more interesting to \nbe honest \num so I think it's the idea of chaining \nlanguage models to determine to figure \nout what information they need to look \nup getting that information from a \nseparate more more accurate more \nreliable more up-to-date source and then \nplugging that back in and letting it \ncontinue on its merry way \noh yeah incredible and uh Bob and I \nrecorded our generate module podcast and \nBob you could hop in more on sort of \njust how you're seeing this kind of you \nknow language model calling the search \ndatabase and you know from Google search \nto webiate search \nyeah it's so it's so funny that you \nbring it up because that's exactly what \nI wanted to say because the um there \nwere like these two things sometimes you \nhave like these multiple things coming \ntogether right so one is exactly when \nyou started with Lang Chan I was looking \ninto like so what is he doing and it's \nlike oh I got it and then there was also \nthat article that I was like when people \nsay like okay hey we can hook this up to \nGoogle search I was like \nyou can also hook it up to a vector \nsearch engine right and do this stuff \nwith your own data so that was why I was \nso super you know I was super excited \nabout uh you know about what you're \nworking on um because I was like you \nknow this is like just a beautiful \nSynergy of all these things coming \ntogether where we really use natural \nlanguage to or create a change or have \nthe database for like you know large \namounts of um uh data and that's just I \nhad the exact same I was looking at the \nexact same thing and when I saw hooking \nit up to Google search and I don't \nremember Conor I think you shared that \nfirst article with me but when I saw \nthat I was like yes that's what we can \ndo and then everything came together and \nand then you started with Lang chain and \nwe were looking at what we could do \nthere it was just it was just super you \nknow super exciting so um I had the \nexact same thing \nand and to your point Bob like I \nactually think it's I think it's more \ninteresting to hook it up to your \nweeviate database or your own internal \ndata because that's just more like \nunique to you and that's more distinct \nto you like anyone can hook it up to \nGoogle Search right \num anyone can hook it up to Wolfram \nAlpha but like your your documents your \ndata that are in your vector database \nyour reviate database connecting it with \nthat like that I think allows you to \nbuild like a differentiated and unique \nkind of like chat bot or question \nanswering or whatever kind of like \nexperience \nexactly and I think why it's interesting \nto do that with like new types of of \nvector databases like \num we've hit or for that matter also uh \nWolfram right so it is that it has this \nnatural language interface so and and \nwhen I recorded the the podcast with uh \nwith together with Conor so while we're \nrecording we have not released the \nmodule yet but when this podcast sees \nthe light of day it people will know \nabout it right so the um is that we're \nmoving towards a \num \nhow should I say to to a way of \ninteracting with the database not with \nlike precise queries and precise answers \nlike you need to have a keyword that \nmatches in your database versus a result \nthat you're getting from the database \nthat must be stored in the database but \nwe can just you know we can just have \nfree associations with our database and \nwe can even generate different results \nbased on the tasks or the prompts that \nwe're giving to our data and I think \nthat's just that that this is super \nexciting I'm just just talking about it \nand thinking about it just makes me like \nsuper exciting for the coming year it's \ngonna be it's gonna be a cool year \nyeah I think like this natural language \nlayer on top of like whether it's \nwhether it's a vector database or a \nstructured SQL database or a \nmongodatabase any of that I think that's \nreally like powerful and really \ninteresting because it allows like \npeople who don't know SQL or don't know \nhow to write graphql to interact with \nthese databases and so \num yeah I'm really excited to see this \nkind of like unlock a lot of you know \nnew people using using this stuff across \na variety of these cases \nyeah that's something that I that I \nthought was so exciting when I first saw \nlion chain is is how the language model \ncan control the database like you just \nsaid with the writing the graphql \nqueries out or writing the SQL queries \nwriting graph database queries uh so can \nwe talk about that kind of uh \norchestration layer where you say tell \nthe language model hey you have like in \nweviate land you have this class you \nhave this class you have this class this \nclass contains like weba blog posts this \ndocumentation this is the code base and \nand so it like chooses which information \nsource to Traverse maybe you can also \ntalk about like SQL or like the Google \nsearch API or just other apis like all \nsorts of external data sources and how \nthat's interface in line J \nyeah I think um I'll maybe start with \njust a SQL database example because I \nthink that's maybe one that that most \npeople are familiar with but it's it's \nthe the ideas are common across other \ntypes of databases whether structured or \nunstructured or vector or anything like \nthat um and I'll start with like a \nsimple example but I think uh we'll see \npretty quickly that it starts to get \npretty complex okay so at the most like \nsimple example \num the pipeline is basically taking a \nnatural language query you then generate \nrelevant SQL and I'll come back to that \nin a little bit but you generate \nrelevance equal you then execute that \nSQL against the database you get back \nthe result and then you you pass that to \nthe language model if desired and kind \nof like return like a human \ninterpretable answer and so \num yeah like I think the example that we \nhave in the documentation is like you \nknow how many employees \num exist and so it like does like you \nknow uh it gets like the count of the \nnumber of rows in the employee table and \nthen returns something to the user like \nthere are nine employees or something \nlike that \num \ntouching on the first part like \ngenerating the relevant SQL query as you \nwere getting at there's a lot of \ninformation that you actually need to \nput in to kind of uh do that correctly \nso you need to you need to kind of like \nput in information about all the tables \nthat exist and then not only the tables \nbut the columns as well \num and and if there are relationships \nbetween those columns you need to input \nthose as well and so the prompt that \nyou're constructing starts to get pretty \ncomplicated already and so \num you know a lot of the the value that \nlane chain provides is ways to like \neasily construct these prompts and then \nalso like just like see what's going on \nlike this is a complicated prompt I'm \nalready describing it I already probably \nlost half the audience and so like I'm \nmaking it like really easy to see like \nwhat's going on and what it actually \nlooks like \num okay so that's like the simple use \ncase but there are a lot of like \ncomplexities so what if there are just \nlike too many tables and too many rows \nand or sorry too many columns in those \ntables to put into the prompts because \nthere are there are context kind of like \nwindow length what do you do then \num and so and so one another chain that \nwe have in LinkedIn is basically a chain \nthat first select relevant tables and \nthen puts only those tables in the \nprompt and so kind of like a simple idea \nbut basically the idea of like filtering \ndown \num then so that's around like \nconstructing the query then after like \nexecuting the query what if the query is \nlike incorrect syntax what if it's kind \nof like references tables that don't \nexist \num what do you do then so I think \nthere's there's a few things that um \nto be honest aren't in link chain yet \nthey might be by the time this gets \nreleased I think they're on our roadmap \none is the concept of kind of like \noutput parsing or validators or \nguardrail so like validating that things \nare valid uh SQL syntax and stuff like \nthat \num another idea is basically the idea of \nkind of like if it tries and it fails \njust like passing that back to the \nlanguage model and letting it learn from \nits mistakes there's a really good \nexample of this working \num from Riley Good Side \num with uh not with SQL but with like a \npython example where he asked it to do a \nmath problem it tries to use like the \nmath module but it's not imported and so \nif you allow it to kind of like correct \nits errors it will see like import error \nmath not recognized and then it will \nkind of like fix it the next time around \nand so I think like things like that for \nfor SQL for any type of database \nquerying will be will be important as \nwell \num \nyeah so I I think that's an overview of \nkind of like what's in LinkedIn \ncurrently and like stuff that we want to \nadd because yeah it gets a little \ncomplex a little quickly \njust out of out of curiosity to build on \ntop of that price ID \num uh because the focus now is mostly \nthat you have like um language right \nLang chain how do you what do you think \nwhen it comes to like these uh \nmulti-model kind of models right so how \nwhat do you think will happen there and \nhow will link potentially evolve with \nthese kinds of uh models but or do you \nhave any thoughts on that \nyeah yeah no that's a really good \nquestion I think um okay so at at the \nsimple uh the simple answer is there's \nbasically kind of like Integrations we \ncan already do and they're actually \nalready rprs for this \num to kind of like hook up kind of like \nmultimodal things on either end of the \nlanguage model so for example like \ntaking audio file transcribe it generate \ngenerate some stuff \num generate some text \num that's you know done by kind of like \nconverting it into the text domain so \num yeah so in that's in that sense it's \nsomewhat multimodal but it's not like \nfully multimodal another example of this \nkind of like quasi thing is like hooking \nit up to an image API or something so so \nthere is a PR open to basically have a \nchain that first like uh takes in uh you \nknow like because all the image prompts \nare like really convoluted like that's \nlike that's like Wizardry right there so \ntake in kind of like a simpler query \ngenerate a more convoluted prompt pass \nit to dolly or something get back an \nimage \num so in that sense um I think there's \nalready there there will shortly be kind \nof like multimodal support in link chain \nmore and more involved than that \nhonestly I I don't know \num at the moment \num I think I know there have been a lot \nof uh more kind of like uh \nfirst class multimodal models coming out \nand so I think we need to look a little \nbit more carefully about how to \nintegrate those \nyeah so the the thinking is like you \nwould have an image captioning model \nthat parses the image into text and then \nit just easily flows into the text \ninterface of the judge Epsom most like \nyeah that's that's kind of how we're \nimagining things uh that would be \neasiest for the current kind of like \nconstruction of LinkedIn for sure and so \nI think that's what we'll do first yeah \nI think that's such an exciting emerging \nthing of the um you know like the the \nmultimodal chat gbt style large Vision \nlanguage model I think that is \ndefinitely on the horizon I would if I \nhad to take a guess I'd say that's \nwithin three months yeah I hope so I'm \nexcited to play around with it I think \num I think character AI has done some \nlike multimodal stuff as well I think \nthey have some multimodal chat Bots \num so yeah excited to see it more \nwidespread oh I just really say yeah I \nsaw it like deep mines Flamingo at \nnerups is is that already \nyeah so I just it's like by matter of \nlike a thought experiment so the other \nday I was thinking about the following \nright so \nwhat I noticed and it's something we we \nare doing also with wifiate and maybe \nthat's also happening for like what \nyou're working on Harrison is that \num I was thinking we somehow we tried to \ncapture these things in like a \ntraditional way of a software engineer \nright so we say okay how do we write the \ntechnology to you know and then we get \nstuff back and we get this complex \nchange in your case or in our case like \nhow will we represent the data I must if \nwe just think about like \ntwo three years from now could it be the \ncase that we're just interact with like \nsoftware completely different because of \nthese LMS and what we're doing today so \nto give you a very pragmatic example \nthe first time I interacted with a \ngenerative model so quite some time ago \nI needed to get used to the fact that I \nwas not writing software so that I just \ncould use natural language to give it an \nassignment that felt so unnatural to me \nright so I'm just curious actually both \nof you how you guys see this because I'm \nI just I have like a feeling that we're \nstill trying to \nshoehorn this into a traditional way of \nwriting software but that maybe in like \na year two years from now that's just a \ncompletely different Paradigm in how we \ncreate technology and or how we interact \nwith the database or how we change \nthings together I'm I'm just curious \nwhat you guys think about that if you \njust you know kind of dream into the \nfuture what this might look like yeah I \nI think \num \nI mean it's a really good question right \nlike that's like I think that you ask \nfor all these things \num is kind of like what people are \ntalking about I don't have any I don't \nhave any great answers I think like one \nthing that um \nI mean kind of like in the vein of like \nand this is a bit more on the like \ndeveloper side of things but on like the \nvein of like multimodal stuff like I \nthink like you know right now a lot of \nthe stuff that we're like when we're \ntalking about ingesting data right for \nlike PDFs like right now we're \ntransforming a PDF into like some text \nand then maybe like embedding that text \nor something like that or transforming \nyeah doing like a caption on image and \nembedding that caption or something like \nthat I think a lot of stuff will move \ntowards just being like talking to each \nother in like embedding space basically \num and translate in between that \num but yeah that that's kind of a little \nbit separate than what you were asking I \ndon't yeah I don't um I mean okay so \nhere's what here's what I'll say around \nlike the ux of actual products I think \nthey'll start to be like look at copilot \nlike why does copilot like work as kind \nof like a product \num it works because it's in a situation \nwhere you don't need 100 accuracy \num there's a human in the loop \num \nand uh \nyeah it's a bit it's it's kind of like \nworking with you and so I think like you \nknow the the common thing for products \nhas been like co-pilot for X co-pilot \nfor x and I think like the important \npart is like it's people are still \ngetting used to working with these \nlanguage models the language models \nstill aren't at like 99 accuracy or even \nclose to that so you need kind of this \nhuman in the loop and this like \nsituations where it's okay to have lower \naccuracy I think we'll start I think as \nlanguage models get better and we get \nmore familiar we'll start to go we'll \nstart to see more applications where \nthere's less human in the loop and \nthey're more automated \num and they're in situations where you \ncan have like higher accuracy uh or or \nsorry yeah where where where yeah where \nyou can get a higher accuracy where you \nneed higher accuracy and it starts to \nunlock that \num so \nyeah you know I don't have any great \ninsights as to what the future will look \nlike but I think that is like one kind \nof like natural progression that that \nwe'll see \nwe'll see yeah exactly because I I was \nalso thinking about this and I I was \ntrying to think back of like the how we \ncould like the origins of it and I \nremember that I had like this 50 moments \nwhen I was at a conference and people \nwere talking about the semantic web and \nthat I was like that some people in the \naudience were like annoyed because we \nhumans couldn't agree on stuff right so \nhow we were structuring the data and \nthat this whole thing of these language \nmodels not even large language but just \nlanguage models in general right back \nthen it was just Cloud pasta Etc that \npeople started to think about what if we \ndon't have to do that anymore \nand I think if you now for example fast \nforward to today so for example let's \nsay that uh Conor and and I that were \nlike we're working on a piece of code \nright and I make a mistakes hey Connor \nit's not what what mistake didn't make \nand Connor looks at it says oh you \nforgot like a summer column or something \nthat I could imagine that we're moving \ntowards the space where you have you're \nalmost running like pseudo code but at \nthe model says Oh no I got you I know \nwhat you want to do I'll just execute it \nright I I see where you're going and I \nwould not be surprised that that would \njust get to a to a natural language \nstate of of programming which of course \nwill come with with certain rules and \nand and certain \num uh ux elements \num I I was I I was listening to a \npodcast from from uh um the open uh \nwhat's the name the open source data \npodcast from Sam ramji and he was \ninterviewing bandorka and then Ben also \nsaid like how will we get the rigor of \nsoftware engineering \ninto working with these language models \nand I find that it's super interesting \nbecause if we're if we and then we like \nuh they had a Humanity we'll figure out \nhow to do that then it will become \neasier for people to interact with these \nmodels but also write technology \nsoftware right so you just describe what \nyou want and the model helps you to \ndeploy it to develop it I would not be \nsurprised that we will see things based \non also what you're working on uh that \nthat data will be like uh deploy a \ncomplex uh infrastructure by just \ndescribing it in natural language and \nthen the model figures out oh then I \nneed to spin up a pot here and I need to \ndo this over there and those kind of \nthings right or or design that you just \nhave visual design you just describe it \nand it was like okay gotcha and it just \nfigures that out so I I really hope that \nit also lowers the barrier for even more \npeople to just write so far and just \ncreate cool things and and I would not \nbe surprising like a year two years now \nwe just we're slowly moving towards \nwell a natural language way of \ndescribing what we want the machines to \ndo and then they just in combination \nwith this model they just figure it out \nand just do it \nyeah and I think there's been a lot of \ntalk around like you know prompt \nengineering like it is prompt \nengineering here to last like my take is \nit will kind of like converge to like \nwhat you're describing like just as you \nwould tell a human how to do something \nyou'll have to tell the language model \nhow to do something and so this to your \npoint around this natural language \ninterface for doing something \num like yeah I think that's pretty \nrealistic that that we can get there \nno yeah that kind of like um I I think I \nreally like the example that Harrison \nbrought earlier quickly I want to come \nback to that about like with the SQL \ncode how you check if it's correct kind \nof and it makes you like I'm so excited \nabout this idea of like the language \nmodel would write code to run \nexperiments like run the experiments and \nthen analyze the experiments could maybe \nkind of Step into the technical and like \nhow will it this look how will it check \nthe correctness and then flow in the \nlength chain uh syntax \nyeah and I mean I mean copilot had a \nreally cool demo of this at one of the \nMicrosoft conferences where they asked \nit to write a problem and then it kind \nof like it it they ran it you could see \nthe output it realized that the output \nit wasn't even that I don't think it ran \ninto any like compile issues or \nsomething it ran successfully but the \noutput was just like nonsensical and so \nit like logically reasoned that there \nmust be a mistake somewhere in like the \nprogram \num so I I don't know how I actually \ndon't know how kind of like co-pilot did \nthat but I would imagine the way that um \nI think like uh \nI think the best way \nI think hard coding like oh check if \nerror check this I think that is uh is \nis doomed for failure because I think \nthat's just you're gonna run into too \nmany educations and so I think actually \nthe the right way to go about this and \nthe way that people will go about this \nin in the future is basically letting \nthe basically telling the language model \nthat it can take these actions it can \nwrite code it can run code it can \nobserve output of code or I guess in the \ncase of SQL you know it can write SQL it \ncan run SQL it can observe the output of \nSQL it can \num check SQL query or something like \nthat and then basically let it determine \nlike what actions it should take so \nfirst you should write some code then it \nshould run the code then it needs to \nlook at the output and and then \ndetermines okay do I need to like edit \nthe code do I need to run it again do I \ncan I return it to the user and so \nbasically like yeah I think the control \nflow will kind of like be determined by \nthe language model but then it just has \naccess to all these like tools or \nactions whatever you want to call them \nwhere it can do certain things but it's \nnot hard it's not hard it's like it's \nnot hard coded that like you do this \nthen you do this then you do this I just \nthink that will not enable the types of \nlike um \nyeah the types of experiences that are \nneeded for these more kind of like \ncomplex workflows \nyeah because I think what Bob was saying \nearlier with the idea of you spin up a \npod and it knows how to monitor the \nproduction app and like I haven't \nlearned to I haven't didn't know too \nmuch about this until I joined weave and \ngot under the curtain and saw other \nthings that happen and it's like that \nidea of you know the language model \nkeeping the software running with all \nthe errors that come up that is just \namazing I think \nyeah exactly and to build on top of that \nso I'm just curious to see if it will go \nto a world where so as you're describing \nit Harrison I think that will of course \nbe like the the short term not even \ntomorrow like right now like we we \ndescribe something what we see with gold \nfighter we describe a problem it outputs \nSQL and then it gets whatever it needs \nfrom the database right but I wouldn't \nbe surprised if we're gonna skip that \nmiddle Step at some point so let's take \nwe've hit as an example there's no \nreason why we've had couldn't have like \na SQL interface we we don't have that \nbut you could theoretically have that \nthat if you just have like the situation \nwhere it's like okay we have like this \nis how the embeddings are encoded on \ndisk or in memory and those kind of \nthings and then the model just knows \nwhere to get it and um that we get just \nnew systems that we just \ninteract with them based on that it just \nknows where the information is and it \njust figures that out by just telling it \nin the prompt right so it literally \nprompt engineering like this is how the \ndatabase is structured this is how we \nstore the vectors and and the data in in \nmemory or on disk do your thing right \nand I I wouldn't be surprised if you see \nI mean not tomorrow but like I would be \nsurprised if very soon we will see the \nfirst maybe research or blog post and \npeople experimenting with this so just \nto cut out the middleman basically where \nthe middleman is the \num \num the the interface language like right \nlike SQL or those kind of because the \nproblem is that these um these \ninterfaces they force us to be extremely \nhyper structured which is understandable \nand which is great for many use cases \nbut what if you can just skip that all \ntogether because the way that we're now \ninterfacing with each other right I I'm \nnot I'm not formatting my questions or \nmy remarks in a certain way then I go \nlike okay I hope that Conor can parse \nwhat I'm saying right now right I just \nuse language and then and then it just \nyou know and I I really hope that that \nis where we where we can go based on \nthese these embedding based and language \nmodel based approaches that's I mean \nit's a little bit further in the future \nbut I I really hope that we can get \nthere and you know with all these tools \nand what everybody's working on \nyeah so Harrison can I ask about some of \nthe prompts that you like the most like \nmaybe like let's think step by step the \nidea of um you are the writer you are \nthe editor you are the reviewer right \nlike like have any of these prompts \nreally stood out to you as being really \ninteresting \nyeah I I think the ones that are most \ninteresting to me are the ones that um \nare good are basically good at \ninteracting with arbitrary external kind \nof like \ntools \num and so what I mean by that is like \num so okay interacting with like \nexternal tools and thinking about how to \nlike reason with tools there's a really \ngood paper called react which is like \nsynthesizing reasoning and acting and \nbasically it combines kind of like some \nof the \num Chain of Thought stuff which is where \nyou kind of like ask the language model \nto kind of like think slowly about what \nit you basically tell it to think \num which sounds silly um but you tell it \nto think \num and then and then acting is like uh \ndetermining kind of like what action to \ntake and what and and what action and \nwhat input to that kind of like action \nor tool to be \num and so combining them it it kind of \nit you know I think the paper showed \nsome pretty nice gains and a bunch of \nbenchmarks and stuff like that \num so that so that type of prompting is \nreally interesting to me because I think \nhaving the language model act as kind of \nlike a conductor that can interact with \nthings is is very powerful and so any \ntype of prompting that enables that I \nreally like now taking like the zero \nshot kind of like thing to that so the \noriginal paper kind of like hard-coded a \nbunch of few shot examples so they gave \nit a bunch of videos I think like the \noriginal in the original paper one of \nthe examples was interacting with like \nthe Wikipedia client and so it could do \nlike a search it could do like a lookup \nI think those were the two actions it \ncould do it gave a bunch of examples of \nuh doing those actions and then it \nlearned from those examples \num and so to the point earlier about \nlike prompt engineering kind of going \nthe way of you just tell it what to do \nlike I think the way that it will be in \nthe future is you won't necessarily have \nto give it those examples you can just \ntell it like this is what you can do and \nso the zero shot way of interacting with \ntools is exactly that there's no \nexamples you just kind of say Hey you \nhave access to this tool it's called \nsearch it takes as input a string and \nwhat it does is it look and you should \nuse it for like current events and stuff \nlike that and then you you do that with \nhowever many tools you have and it kind \nof just like learns to use them in a \nzero shot way \num and and the the the react prompting \nis is really powerful for this because \nit lets like think about like you know \nall the information it has like the tool \nname and the tool description and stuff \nlike that and I find this really cool \nand I think like um yeah one it like \nworks surprisingly well just out of the \nbox \num and then the other like really fun \nthing is that if it's not working it's \nkind of easy to tweak by just like \nchanging the description of the tool so \none of the common questions I get asked \nis like how can I like you know it's \nusing this tool incorrectly or like how \ncan I get it to use this tool in this \nspecific scenario and it sounds stupid \nbut the answer is you just tell it to \nlike you just tell the language model \nlike use this when you have a question \nabout math use this when you have a \nquestion about music and and it's \ngenerally pretty good at like observing \nthat and following those instructions \num and so that type of like zero shot \nreact prompting is that's that's by far \nthe most interesting stuff to me I think \nvery exciting very exciting I just I \njust want to highlight one more time \nthat when you said like you just tell it \ntoo that is just how far we got like in \nlike just think about two years ago \nright \nit's that is just that that one sentence \nthere you just tell it that was like how \nexciting that is I I love that \nyep yeah all in in all the papers \num you know a lot of the papers that \ncame out in this were from like a I mean \nyeah even like a year ago when you \nneeded few shot examples and you \ncouldn't just tell it to and you had to \ndo this like really elaborate prompt \nengineering and now you just kind of \nlike tell it to and there's still like \nagain like I don't think this I don't \nthink this means that there's no need \nfor prompt engineering like you still \nhave to like figure out how to like you \nstill have to construct The Prompt in a \ncertain way and you still have to tell \nit like what scenarios it's good for and \nstuff like that \num but it's a lot easier too and it's \njust like it's more similar just \nchatting with a human and instructing \nthe human \nyeah I think maybe playing the devil's \nadvocate here I think kind of the you \njust tell it too is maybe like I think \nthe whole thing about prompt engineering \nis that there is a little bit of an art \nto telling it right like and so I'm \nreally curious about this intersection \nbetween like you could sample many \ndecodings from the large language model \nthat temperature thing being like the \nkey knob that you can slide maybe \nfirstly just set the stage what do you \nthink about that temperature parameter \non the large language models \nI think um if I'm so I think there's two \ndifferent like ways to use language \nmodels I would say one is like \nleveraging their like reasoning ability \num and their ability to like you know \nyeah take ambiguity and and this and \ndecipher and decide what to do and this \ncomes into a lot of the action stuff and \nthen the other is generating text right \ngenerating Pros generating poems so for \nthe latter for like generating text yeah \ncrank the temperature up like get some \nlike funky responses go for it but for \nlike the part where you want to like \nreason about things I almost always set \nlike temperature to zero and just \nbecause you want the single kind of like \nyou want the best most accurate response \nyeah that's it's interesting that you \nsay that because the what we're also \nseeing with the database right so and \nand um Conor and I coincidentally \nearlier today had a conversation about \nthat that what I really believe is like \nyou have like the the reasoning aspect \nof the model \nand then in our case also the database \nright so appreciate that you can say \nokay we're gonna literally in front \nengineering you tell it like we're gonna \ngive you information in this format and \nyou must base your answer on the \ninformation and we're giving it and if \nyou can't tell us you can't and then \ntemperature all the way to zero you know \nwhat I mean and and I and I find it very \ninteresting because what that means is \nthat you're kind of cutting out and I'm \nrecording it the knowledge \nthat is in the model but you keep it to \nthe language understanding like as if \nyou have like a human who just \nunderstands everything you're saying but \nhas no knowledge and has like an old set \nof you know encyclopedias and then you \ngo like okay \nwhat's the distance from Earth to the \nMoon and okay let I understand the \nquestion let me find that in the in the \nencyclopedia and uh I find that that I \nfind that very intriguing and I'm \ncurious I have a question for you about \nthis Harrison so \num they're like two camps right that we \nsee like one is like we're gonna keep \nfine-tuning the model \nuntil it has all the knowledge right for \nwhatever use case we have \nor we're gonna just keep that separation \nthat we say like these um we have the \nmodel and we just feed it with \num uh with data coming from a data \nsource I'm just I'm just curious where \num uh I mean I have strong opinions on \nthis but I'm very curious where you sit \non uh on this uh no this this this this \nain't you know what your angle is what \nyour take is on these these approaches \nyeah I mean I I think there's a honestly \nI think there's like a place in time for \nboth \num I don't think that one's kind of like \nstrictly better than the other I think \nthe one that's more interesting to me is \nkind of like the one that you combine \nwith external data I think um but like \nyou know if we think about if we think \nabout that language model is kind of \nlike acting as a decision maker or a \nrouter one of the things that it could \nroute to is a larger language model that \nis trained on everything and it could \ncall that like when it needs to \num but yeah I think like um I think the \nidea of well okay so yeah the idea of \nfine-tuning on everything and always \ntrying to make sure the language model \nis up to date I'm not very bullish on \nthat I do think there's a place for like \ngeneral purpose language models but as I \nsaid I'd rather use that as like a tool \nrather than trying to like have that be \nthe sole source of everything \num and and then yeah like combining data \nwith language models I think there's \nyeah there's I mean even today you can \ndo that with prompt engineering there's \nsome like really interesting papers on \nlike um kind of like ways to do it at a \nmore kind of like um \nmore native to the model so where you're \nactually attending over embeddings of \ndocuments that you pull so like retro \nstyle approaches \num I don't think there are any great \npublicly available models for that yet \nbut that that might be something that \ncomes out in the next year or two that \nwould be really interesting \num and then yeah the the idea of having \nlike um \nthe language model act as a router one \nthing that I I like I would love to have \nlike a fine-tuned model that's just \nreally good at zero shot kind of like \nrouting and reasoning \num and I'm actually chatting with a few \nFolks by this so I don't know when this \nis coming out so it's possible that when \nthis comes out we'll we'll have some \nlike uh yeah we'll we'll have already \nshared some stuff about that but like I \nthink I think creating that like small \nfine-tuned model really good at zero \nshot reasoning would be really really \ncool \num and so yeah that's kind of the that's \nthe type of fine tuning that I'm \ninterested in I'm not interested in kind \nof like the fine-tuning to make it kind \nof like up to date with every possible \ninformation that's under the sun I'm \nmore interested in kind of like the fine \ntuning to have it do routing to other \nsources of information \nyeah I like that very much so I'm I I \nhave a very similar uh point of view so \nI would not be surprised if we're gonna \nsee these kind of models that are just \nthat indeed are like good at like \ngeneral purpose things like an llm for \nmedical terminology in LM for legal \nterminology in LM for engineering those \nkind of things but that it is very good \nat just processing basically these \nOne-Shot approach right that you \nmentioned that it just it understands \nlike for like other terms of the \nunderstands it can help you reason what \nkind of data that it needs to get from \nin this case a database or any data \nsource that you can tell it's I'm it's \ninteresting to say that because I have a \nvery similar point of view yeah \nyeah I think I'm I I used to really like \nthis idea of like you would maybe have \nsome kind of classifier that classifies \nthe model in the hugging face model Hub \nthat's the best for this task but uh so \nso what will this all these large \nlanguage models the lawyer the \nbiomedical language model how do you see \nlike how will that be organized \nfirst of all I don't think anyone knows \nwhich makes this so exciting \num I think \num yeah I mean like I don't know right \nnow the the private models are way \nbetter than the open source models like \num I think it's yeah like you know GPT \ngpt3 is way better than than the best \nopen source models probably flon T5 \num anthropic when they come out with \ntheir model it'll probably be pretty \ngood \num I think there you know it's like um \nI I it's possible that there it's \npossible there will be a better open \nsource model release it's possible that \nto your point around like having a model \nspecifically for medical or specifically \nfor law maybe you can get that by \nfine-tuning font T5 and it's and it's \nless about kind of like you know maybe \nfor like smaller more narrow things like \nthat actually definitely for small for \nsmaller narrow things you can probably \nget just as good performance by fine \ntuning font T5 or something like that \nfirst like it kind of just depends on \nlike what small and narrow is right like \nis law like small and narrow I would \nargue it's still kind of like big and \nand and and out there but it's \ndefinitely smaller than like every piece \nof knowledge on the Sun so \num yeah I don't know I mean I guess my \ncurrent guess would be that they'll be \nlike the the private models will be the \nbest general purpose ones the open \nsource models will be fine for small \nsmaller tasks and I think probably over \ntime like the \nlike \nthe the open source models will start \ncatching up and at the same time the \nprivate models will keep on getting \nbetter and better so I think they'll \nalways be this Gap it will just become \nlike you know what's in this Gap is is \nthe real value in this Gap or is the \nreal value now doable with like smaller \nfine-tuned models and and I don't I \ndon't I don't know I don't know how fast \nthose will move up a lot a lot of \nquestions \nyeah actually now when you when you put \nit like that I'll take back what I said \nbefore so just I hope you can cut that \nout to comment I'm joking but the but \nthe um it just let one model it's just \none model to uh to roll them all and \nthen maybe a few different providers \nwith different you know for the \neducation I don't know but uh \num yeah so this is what I meant like \nwhat I said it's like it's like this \ntraditional mindset right so you know \nit's like you have different programming \nlanguages for different tasks but like \nwhy not why not one one model that does \nit does make sense \nyeah I think the counter argument to \nthat though would be like right now the \ninference is kind of expensive like \ncompared to if I train like an \nextractive QA model on my documentation \nlike it you know I could even sparsify \nthe question answering model it maybe is \nonly like 80 million parameters and so \nit's just super fast that would be kind \nof my counter argument to like the \nsmaller fine-tuned models for certain \ntasks like in the search pipeline like \nthe re-rank all right like I see a lot \nof tweets that are like oh you can use \nthe large language model to re-rank and \nI'm like what a waste of the large but \nlike to re-rank it's like kind of a I I \nthink the Paradigm and and there's a \ngood quote from uh Stan from dust and so \nI'm going to shamelessly steal it here \nbut he has a great quote that's like \num no gpus before pmf which is basically \nlike no gpus no fine-tuning models \nbefore pmf product Market fit before you \nknow what you're doing and I think like \num the power of large language models is \nthat they're so good at just like \narbitrary tasks and you can get them to \ndo like basically whatever and so \nexperimenting with like different \ndifferent pipelines or different things \nthat you're doing is really it's it's so \nmuch easier than before and so I think \nthe common thing will basically be like \nyou know experiment with the best models \nthen when you actually get something \nthat's like working and you want to \nscale it up not even that's like what \nlike when it's working and it's just for \nyou it's probably fine but when you want \nto like scale it up then you need to \nworry about like fine-tuning models and \nso I think it's also kind of like a \nprogression as well like you know if I \nif I was building an application I would \nnever start with a fine I would never \nstart with fine-tuning no I'd start with \nthe the language model and then when I \nor I'd start with uh the biggest \nlanguage model gpt3 or something like \nthat \nand then when \num yeah when when when I get to the \npoint where I have enough confidence \nthat I need to scale it up then I'd \nstart thinking about that and I think \nthat'll be like a pretty common workflow \nand I'm I've already seen a few people \nin yeah I've already seen a few people \nlike doing that it's um it's not that \ncrazy right so \nso I just want to say that's very that's \nvery interesting and especially with \nwhat you said with cmap right with \nproduct marks because it's like there's \nthis Tipping Point of life with the \nmodels being the general first models \nare good enough to solve the task right \nso it just and we're just we're hitting \nthat Tipping Point I found it \nfascinating to what we saw the last few \nweeks the discussions on Twitter and \nwhat have you and in newspapers I was \njust sitting on the sides eating popcorn \nwhile I was watching it right of seeing \nlike core research but also like product \npeople working in this space how they \nlook at this very differently right so \nit's like uh and I think I think um that \nis for from me in my profession one of \nthe breakthroughs of 10 GPT was not only \nusing the model to do it but also the \npackaging like the it's it's so simple \nif you think about it but it's so well \nexecuted and \num and that kind of ties into what you \nwere saying uh Harrison that it's it is \nit where to just we're just past the \nTipping Point that where you can build \namazing stuff like for example uh taking \nLang chain right and solve your problem \nor store your data and weed it and \nfactorize it just and just start \nsearching and doing whatever you want to \ndo that just that is just that has \nchanged in the last year as opposed to a \nyear before and that is also why I said \nearlier like I'll take back my what I \nsays like maybe it's just gonna be like \none model right or just a handful of \nmodels that are just good enough \nyeah awesome so I kind of want to Pivot \ntopics and um you know and ask Harrison \na question about sort of the virality of \nLang chain and the open source \nengagement has been something that's \nreally been impressive and so I just \nwant to ask kind of like like how like \nthe question like how did you do this \nhow did you start the fire like \nobviously you're a really smart guy and \nthe idea sticks like crazy but yeah like \nwhat are your thoughts on that yeah I \nmean I think like um \nI think like uh \nhonestly I mean one it's just been like \nso much fun and I think like that's the \nthing with like all these things I think \nBob was saying like it's super easy to \nlike create these things like it's just \nso much fun and people have fun building \nthese things and I have fun building \nthese things and so it's just like I I \ndon't know there's um \nyeah like I I think there's just a \nthere's there's a lot of like energy and \naspect of fun and just like building \nthings and exploring and so I don't \nthink like um yeah like I I think um \nyeah like like yeah I don't think I I \nhaven't done anything like in particular \nit's just been like a lot of fun I think \nlike yeah I mean like the you know the \nthe the two things that I try to focus \non besides just having fun although they \nare like very related are like build \nlike actually useful things \num and then like be nice as well like I \nthink like and that gets back into like \nhaving fun right like I think like there \nreally is just like everyone's like this \nis a great time to be hacking on like \nideas and being exploring ideas right \nthis is a phenomenal point in like uh \nyou know yeah like I'm not that old but \nlike this is by far the best point in my \nlifetime for like exploring these types \nof ideas and so and I think a lot of \npeople realize that and I think a lot of \npeople are out there doing that and so \njust like trying to build things that \nare actually useful for them and then \nlike you know like \nbe nice and having fun with people as \nthey're doing it like I think you know I \nyeah no no that's that's all I really \ngot so \nyeah that's incredible and I think just \nlike that yeah exactly like the \ncontagiousness of sharing um this prompt \nsequence created this is yeah and the it \nis really truly amazing um so I'm kind \nof curious to see like the Lang chain \nHub uh so what are kind of the \ndirections that you're thinking of \ntaking Lane china \nyeah I mean I think like the to your \npoint around basically like sharing this \nprompt sequence sharing that's exactly \nwhat link chain Hub is is designed to do \num I think we put something out really \nquickly in like a GitHub repo where it's \njust a collection of kind of like chains \nand agents and prompts that that you can \neasily load and prompts you can't really \nuse by themselves but like chains and \nagents you can just easily load and use \nby themselves \num and I think the despite it being a \nterrible ux as it like you know GitHub \nrepos are great don't get me wrong but \nthey're not meant for like sharing and \ndiscoverability and stuff \num and so \num like within a particular GitHub repo \nso despite that terrible ux like I think \nwe saw a lot of people really interested \nin it and so I think that's something \nthat where you know and I think like \nlike why are people interested in this \nbecause like \nthere there's just so many different \nthings that you can do with them and and \nso like having them like and and again \ngoing back to like the just like hacking \nand building and playing around like \nthere's definitely that type of like \natmosphere and a big part of that is \nlike sharing your work and and so \nthey're like not just Lane changes open \nsource but a lot of other really awesome \nprojects built on top of it are open \nsource and so like the idea of like \nsharing \num I think people really enjoy and like \nin in lynching Hub is really just aimed \nat making it um easy to share your your \nchange your agents your prompts stuff \nlike that yeah so maybe uh yeah like the \nthe open source thing is really \nfascinating like the um how has kind of \nthe maintenance been of it as because I \nunderstand how like how many are you the \nsole maintainer or how does that kind of \nthing happen yeah so there's one other \nperson working on it full time with me \nthe maintenance costs have definitely \ngone up I'm not gonna lie I think \nthere's like yeah I think there's like \n110 GitHub issues and like 43 open PRS \nso gotta catch up on that a little bit \nfor sure \num but on honestly like I think it's \nbeen um but like \nbut but it's been like fun like it's \nit's like all the things that people are \nadding are like \num you know like people are adding like \ndifferent uh different kinds of like \nembedding modules different types of of \nmodel providers like there's like that I \nhadn't even heard about but like now I'm \nlike okay I gotta go check that out like \ndifferent types of like \num Vector stories different types of \nchains different types of of tools to \nlike interact with and so I think like \num even though there's a lot of issues I \nmean and someone like opened up a PR for \nlike some of like the image stuff right \nso it's like \num I don't know like even though there's \na bunch of stuff \num and and there's a little bit of a \nbacklog which I need to I need to fix \nright after this \num but uh yeah it hasn't been like too \nlaborious to kind of like keep up with \nor anything like that awesome well \nfantastic Harrison I'll let you get back \nto it uh I thought this was such an \nincredible such an incredible podcast I \nmean yeah the the sequential change is \nthe first thing that just helped me \ninstantly get it so if listeners are out \nthere wondering checking my chain out \nfor the first time you know the \nsequential chain of how you chain \ntogether multiple language model calls \none to the weeviate vector database and \nyeah I think it's just such a \nfascinating library and seeing it emerge \nso Harrison thank you so much for your \ntime and joining the weba podcast no \nthank you guys for having me and yeah \njust uh I don't know if people listening \nto this realize but like we V8 and you \nin particular Connor reached out super \nearly on in the link chain Journey like \nI don't like it was it was uh yeah like \nI uh yeah that was a while ago and it's \nbeen awesome to kind of like work with \nyou guys and and kind of like I think we \nboth see the world in like similar ways \nand and there's a lot like I think \nVector stores and are like for a lot of \napplications are like a critical \nenabling piece and so it's been awesome \nto to work with you guys and and chat \nabout stuff and so yeah thanks for \nthanks for having me on always always \nhappy to be \nlike yeah thank you it's super exciting \nand you know we're you know here to help \neach other because it's just a whole new \necosystem that's like it's like a \nsupernova like you know thanks to these \nLMS and like this whole new ecosystem \nand would just I I think we we need to \nhelp each other right to to reach our \ngoals and this is just yeah this is \nsuper exciting \n", "type": "Video", "name": "LangChain and
