{"text": "Join \u202aConnor Shorten (Henry AI Labs) and Charles Pierse (Keenious) for the second Weaviate vector search engine Podcast.\u202c \nhere with charles pierce a machine \nlearning engineer at kenius at kenius \nthey're building a really exciting \nscientific literature mining tool using \ntools like deep learning and vector \nsearch in order to let you search \nthrough the scientific literature to \nfind relevant papers and relevant \ninformation for whatever you're \nresearching so really exciting thing \nabout keeney is that stood out to me is \nit's uh plug into google docs and \nmicrosoft word as you're writing a paper \nor drafting up an idea you can highlight \ntext and then just query the keynes \nthrough this plugin and it will search \nthrough the scientific literature to \nhelp you find relevant ideas so i think \nthis is an extremely exciting and \npowerful idea so i'm really excited to \ntalk to charles about kenius and all \nthese different ideas around scientific \nliterature mining deep learning and \nvector search and the grand vision of \nwhere we think this kind of thing is \nheaded so thanks so much charles for \ncoming on this podcast connor thank you \nvery much uh i'm honored honored to be \nhonored to talk about genius and \nour experience with kind of vector \nsearch in general and what we've been \ndoing with we've a couple of the past \ncouple of months so yeah thank you very \nmuch super cool so before we get into \nkind of the details of it could you \nexplain to me uh like where kenius is at \nhow it's organized and sort of also \nintroduced the problem of scientific \nliterature mining yeah so uh genius is \nit's an academic search tool \num as you mentioned and \ni suppose the core of what kenius tries \nto do is \njust to make \nresearch um and academic publications \neasier to to search and explore and to \ndiscover \nso kenya's kind of takes kind of a \nholistic approach towards research \nin that we \nwe try and cater to researchers from all \nlevels and that's kind of from \nundergraduates all the way up to phds \nso our kind of guiding philosophy should \nbe that \nyou know we want to kind of create that \nwikipedia effect of going down a black \nhole of like you know discovering topics \nand we want to do that with research \npublications and research \nresearch journals or any kind of \nentities within within research so \nour kind of guiding light is always to \nmake that process of exploration fun and \nadd a bit of serendipity that's kind of \nhow we describe it it's serendipitous \nsearch so you know we \nwe're not like kind of an exactly a \ntraditional academic search tool where \nyou type in a single kind of forward \nquery and get back exact results we of \ncourse can do that but we also like to \nadd in this kind of serendipitous like \nhey \nhere's an intro here are also some other \ninteresting results that might not match \nexactly on keywords whether within the \nkind of within the academic sphere of \nwhat you're what your research you know \nwhat you're looking for um and of course \nthen clenius obviously has \nwe we don't limit ourselves to short \nqueries uh you can search uh you can \nsearch on genius \nwith uh documents of any arbitrary size \nso there really is no no limit you can \nif you \nif you're if you've got a paper with i \ndon't know ten thousand to a hundred \nthousand words you can search using that \npaper our search engines optimize to \nconduct queries that big \nso it's it's all kind of possible um \nand where we're at now with genius is \nthat \nprobably for around the last \ntwo years um we've been kind of in heavy \ndevelopment of the of the product \num and \nover the last maybe eight nine months \nwe've been expanding heavily to \nintegrate kind of some a lot of \nknowledge graph features so \num we've been working a lot on kind of \nbecoming as well as being an add-on \nbecoming kind of a goat a kind of a \nsingle \ncentralized like kind of just database \nfor searching authors and \ntopics and institutions so you can you \ncan really search through any kind of \nentity type now um and we're \nwe're really trying to kind of \nlike kind of introduce a introduce a new \nway of discovering academia to kind of \ncompete with google scholar in a way \nthat we think is more organic and in a \nway that we think kind of \nfacilitates \nuh serendipitous discovery in kind of an \neasier way super cool so i think \nstarting on the on the comparison of \ngoogle scholar and so anyone um \nlistening charles has written a really \ngreat article that details these topics \nuh about using wev8 and searching \nthrough 60 million academic papers and \nyeah this topic of serendipity really \nstood out to me it's very interesting \nbecause \nwe talk about neurosymbolic search where \nyou have the neural search where you're \nusing these vector embeddings and you're \nlooking for the nearest neighbor in \nthese vector embedding spaces then you \nalso have symbolic filters which is like \ngoogle scholar where you have keywords \nso say you type in data augmentation \nyou're doing data augmentation research \nit'll match the data augmentation \nkeyword whereas this idea of serendipity \nthat charles is describing is \nin between matching the keywords as well \nas this kind of neural search so it's \nkind of like this um \nthis uh \nrange i guess where you're either \nlooking for an exact match of the \nkeyword or you're looking for a set \ncenter of the fuzzy discovery of the \nneural search engine so this is this \nkind of like how you're thinking about \nneurosymbolic searches and that it \nenables this kind of creativity \nyeah that's that's exactly the point is \nthat \ntheir \nsearch is a funny thing and that there \nare times when we have we do searches \nwhere they are \ncertainly the \nthe intent is to do kind of a keyword \nsearch and that's fine and you know most \nsearch engines today behave like that \nand they're great \nbut neurosymbolic search and kind of \nneural search \nis what's most interesting to us and to \nme i you know i'm fascinated by it \nbecause \nit kind of it's it's only in its infancy \nnow but already with \nin in the ways that it's kind of \nit's shown its usefulness it kind of \ni think it works in a in a way that very \nhuman and very unders like kind of \nvery easy to understand from the \nstandpoint of how we associate ideas in \nour own heads you know they they're not \nnecessarily interlinked via keywords \nbut they do exist in these spheres of \nkind of context or sphere like you know \nyeah exactly context \nand \nspheres \nkind of these spheres of relatedness \nthat aren't explicitly connected through \nkeywords so \nwhat we really try and do is kind of \nwrite these heuristics where we \nunderstand we try and understand when \nour user might be \nlooking to do a very strictly a very \nstrict search and their intent is to \nfind exact keywords because of course \nyou know that's a very it's really \nimportant to be able to satisfy that \nneed as well \nand then we try and also solve for the \ncase where a user might be like hey i \ndon't really understand this topic too \nwell or this is something that's new to \nme and i just want to ground myself \nin all the relevant research around this \ntopic or this concept like kind of \nconceptual field \nand to be able to conduct search there \nis what really interests us and that's \nwhat we think we do well \nand that's what that's kind of i suppose \nthat's our unique selling point at the \nmoment is that we we really feel \nwe can we can do that kind of \ncontext-based neurosymbolic search \nreally well \nand help students and researchers find \nfind things they wouldn't be able to \nfind kind of via phrasing a query or \nanything like that \nnormally yeah i'm super excited about \nthe idea of in context and i really want \nto get into your use of knowledge graphs \nand the graph structured embeddings i \ndon't think i think the use of citation \nnetworks is one of the most popular \nexamples for communicating the idea of \ngraph embeddings in deep learning and \nyou know the you're probably 101 graph \nneural network tutorial will be with the \ncitation network so i'm really excited \nto get into that but i want to stay a \nlittle more on this neural symbolic \nthing and this idea of classifying the \nuser intent in order to maybe add on \nsymbolic filters because i think maybe \nthe the interface that \nscales you between neural search and \nsymbolic search like for example in wva \nyou have to use graphql \nto add these kind of symbolic filters so \nis there a layer in between the search \nthat classifies the user intent and \npredicts whether they are going to need \na symbolic filter on it or predict \nwhether they're in the say discovery \nphase and they want that kind of \nuh \nuncurated result that would come from \nneural search absolutely yeah now we we \nhave we have kind of a bunch of uh kind \nof learned over time heuristics that \nhave kind of brought us that that \nbrought us to that point \nso you know \none very simple heuristic you can think \nof is literally just the length of a \nquery um if you if you have a if you \nhave a few short words \nwell \nyou know i'm talking under five six \nwords that query \nthere's probably a higher chance that \nthe user there might know exactly what \nthey're looking for and or like have a \nfew keywords \nkeywords in mind so \nwhen we do our search it's not that we \num \nturn off the \nnor symbolic search or the the semantic \naspect of the search but we might dampen \nthe results you know so we have this \nkind of trade-off between \nhow we value and weight \num \nvalue and weight or \nweight or search results so \none example of a heuristic might be with \nthis the length of a query that you know \nif it's really short and kind of exact \nwell then we know that the keyword \nsearch might be really appropriate here \nbecause this person has an idea but then \nwe also have a feature in genius where \nif you \nif you like a particular paper you can \nkind of click and find similar articles \num or find similar papers button \nand we're always focusing on making that \neven kind of that feature easier or more \napparent but \nwith that feature what it really does is \nin that when we can we consider that \nintent as being the user really being \nopen to explore you know because in in \nthat instance they don't have an \nexplicit query they're just saying hey i \nlike this paper um so then we really \nwill really bump up the the semantic \naspect of the search um \nand we'll \nwe'll really kind of focus in on \nlet's say using our knowledge graph \nsearch there \num and really valuing the semantic \nvectors over a keyword search because we \nfind them those to be \nmuch more useful especially with the not \nsince we've introduced the knowledge \ngraph than the text search because the \nknowledge graph tends to really find you \nthese gems \nkind of in the research proximity of a \npaper you know so you'll kind of find \nthat you start all these milestone \npapers come up as well as just really \ninteresting kind of papers that you \ncouldn't really get um with it with an \nexact query because you don't know how \nto search you might know exactly what \nwhat what the field is you're you're \nlooking at or the subfield you're \nlooking at is so \ndo you think about like um like user \nembeddings like you have returning users \nand like you know maybe using their \nspecific some kind of embedding their \nspecific behavior to kind of guide that \nyeah \nso that that's something where we we've \nlooked into that and we we have like \nsome \npretty cool ideas to do that but we're \nnot doing it just yet um in terms of \nlike it there's \na lot of the time with search engines \nlike this there's kind of this \nuh you need to hit a critical mass \num of like user embeddings to get there \nbecause we have you know over 60 million \npapers it takes it takes some time to \ncollect enough data \nto \nto really build like rich and rich \nembeddings off of that you know you \nactually need quite a \nquite a bit of quite a bit of user data \nto start getting useful uh \nitem embeddings for recommendation there \nbut that's that's certainly going to be \nhappening \num and that's why actually knowledge \ngraph the knowledge graph embeddings \nwere so attractive to us because they \nkind of solved that cold start problem \nwhere you can get really good \nrecommendations \num from papers with kind of a \nzero like you know theoretically zero \ninformation about users and and their \nlikes and interests \nthat's so interesting i'm definitely \ngonna be you know coming back to this \ninterview and thinking further about \nthat one that kind of like maybe like a \nsemi-supervised approach where you have \nsome label data and um and mostly \nunlabeled data but in the case of this \n60 million graph it's like \nsemi-supervised in a very extreme case \nwhere you have a extremely small amount \nof labels so so let's transition to this \ncold start problem and and um and like \nwhat that looks like with paper \nrecommendation i suppose the way that we \nlook at the at the cold star problem \nwith the way we had looked at is that we \nwere looking \nfor a solution where \nwe let's say let's say there's an \ninstance where a user has \nthey don't have a they're in there they \ndon't have a paper that they're \ncurrently writing \nand they don't have a query they don't \neven have a query to write \nthey might have \nthey might have an idea of a field of \nstudy or concept that they're interested \nin they might have an author that \nthey're interested in or maybe a \nprofessor mentioned a seminal a seminal \npaper let's say we'll take for example \nattention is all you need you know that \nthe seminal kind of transformers um burp \npaper \nso \nthat might be all they have they might \nthey don't know what query to write so \nwe kind of viewed the cold start problem \nas being a way to \ngive recommend really rich \nrecommendations for papers without like \nthe user having a document or having it \nbeing able to formulate a query \nso \nthe first stage of that has been with \nthis just the using paper identities but \nwe're kind of we're we're getting close \nto being able to pretty much \nsearch from any entity type which is \nsuper exciting um but right now \nthe way you'll be able to do it is if \nyou have a paper like attention is all \nyou need that's the paper is all you \nneed to the name of the paper is all you \nneed to \nthat's an awful pun to um \nto get a recommendation really and you \ncan feed that paper in or you can feed a \ncollection of papers in and we'll get an \naverage we'll get an average kind of \nembedding for you and we'll we'll search \noff that paper for you and find \nwe can find like hundreds of thousands \nof papers in its proximity and you know \nsome people might say oh you're just \ngoing to get the papers that it was that \nit cited but no what's going to happen \nis you you're of course that actually \nhow we measure how good the model is \nthat we build is how many \npapers obviously \nfrom that it's cited that it returns but \nafter that then you're going to start \nseeing you know these uh papers that \npapers inside decided and so on and so \nforth and you know you get this kind of \nindirect relationship that's what graphs \nyou know that's the power of knowledge \ngraphs \nthey allow you to to query indirect \nrelationships um and the knowledge graph \nembeddings which we have you know \nideally what they'll do is all the \npapers around attention is all you need \nwill be embedded \nin a latent space with other relevant \npapers \nto that to that paper outside of its \ncitation graph so before we get into the \ngraph a little more do you think search \nand recommendation systems are kind of \nthe same tasks like do you find yourself \nthe the lessons and i think like rexis \nis what they use in the papers it's all \nthe same kind of thing and also do you \nlike re-ranking is that also kind of \nlike all the same thing really \nit's we we \nwe we've had this conversation so much \nat work where \nit's it's kind of in my opinion it's \nthey're kind of melding into into the \nsame thing \nit's getting to a point where \nwhen does a when does a search become a \nrecommendation \nwhen does a recommendation become a \nsearch because you know \nif if here's if we're getting users to \ninput like anything like entities such \nas papers or authors or fields of study \nwell that's a query but the query is a \nsolid entity and then we're recommending \nbased off of that entity so \nthe line is the line is kind of \nkind of pinning down i suppose because \nyou know the experience in genius is \nthat you can feed in both a query a \ndocument or now just a paper name but \nwe're still going to give you the same \ntype of results list back of papers so \nif the outcome is the same \nthe the difference is starting to kind \nof become \nhard to decide \num \nso and in terms of the the re-ranking \nreranking's really interesting um \nbecause \ni i suppose with re-ranking the way \nlet's say for example how google use it \nthey have some really clever clever ways \nof using it where it is kind of maybe \nmore in the traditional search space and \nthen they find all these \nyou know they don't just use the query \nas the re-ranking factor they use things \nlike geographic location previous \nintents previous searches to to re-rank \nyour results for you so \ni think re-ranking is for me it's like a \nway of ensuring relevancy from a result \nset and that that's what i find really \ncool you know we use re-ranking we have \na genius has a really interesting \nbookmarking system where we if you as \nyou say if you find like \nhundreds of papers you're like we \nwill rewrite those papers when you go \ninto your bookmark system and let's say \nif you're reading it if you're currently \nwriting an essay \nabout um optimizers or and how \noptimizers works work in neural networks \nwell then the papers that you see first \nin your bookmark toolbar will be papers \non that and we do that automatically so \nyou might have you and then the next \nweek you might be writing a paper on um \ni don't know the attention mechanisms \nand then every paper in your bookmark \nsystem about it the attention mechanism \nwill be ranked first so we found that to \nbe a really interesting use case of \nre-ranking where we we contextually \nre-rank depending on what you're doing \nso yeah i guess like with with the way i \nthink about it is like maybe when you \nhave the recommendation system kind of \nproblem set up you maybe have like the \nreinforcement learning optimization as \nyou are and and i think the genius is a \nvery cool interface for this as you like \nas you if the uh user cites the paper \nit's like the reward for saying you \nrecommended a good paper they cited it \nso that kind of thing of um of having \nsome kind of maybe reinforcement \nlearning feedback \nis that do you think reinforce and \nlearning is useful or do you think it's \nmore of a researchy idea um i i think \nreinforcement learning is going to in \nthe next five years is probably going to \nexplode much more into the mainstream \nkind of \nml world than it has over the last 10 in \nthat \nexactly like you said i think \nreinforcement learning kind of the last \nmaybe five or six years has been focused \na lot of it has been focused on like \ngames and atari and solving those types \nof problems but now like the reward \nfunctions are looking at things like \nokay what we define a reward function \naccording to \na user like or a user citing a paper and \nand now \nall the same algorithms from that have \nbeen used previously are applicable and \nyou know the internet and recommendation \nsystems are completely based off of you \nknow netflix you watch a film that's a \nthat's a a one plus in terms of uh \nthis \nagent system or this reinforcement and \nlearning architecture so \nfor from a lot of papers i've been \nreading lately it seems that that kind \nof crossover into the mainstream is \nhappening \ni'm not like hugely fluent on everything \nreinforcement learning but from what i \ndo know is uh over what i want what from \nwhat i have read and heard is it it does \nseem like it's it's kind of crossing \nthat threshold um kind of the way you \nknow \nnatural language processing did six or \nseven years ago where it was kind of \nbefore that image was the \nimages and \nwas it was everything and now the kind \nof text is text and natural language \nprocessing is kind of the \nthe key modality right now when people \nthink of kind of state of the art and i \nthink reinforcement learning might be \ngoing there next and primarily because \nnatural language processing is \nincredible but most data sets that you \nknow users or companies have they're not \nactually text completely textually \ndriven they're \nthey're tabular they're they're split up \ninto scalar values and you can you can \nuse that much more in reinforcement \nlearning systems as inputs than you can \npurely text data of course text is \nalways great because it's a you can use \nthose embeddings as additional features \nbut \nyou can use everything with \nreinforcement learning yeah and i think \nlike with reinforced learning it's like \nyou start off with these q tables that \nevaluate state action pairs and that's \nfine if you're uh say the cardinality of \nactions isn't too bad but when you say \nyou're using reinforced learning for \ntext generation and you're going to \niteratively select tokens to generate \nout of a vocabulary of like 30 000 \ntokens that's much harder than uh left \nright up down in an atari game so i \nthink that's where a lot of the problem \nwith reinforced learning for like q \nlearning for say text summarization or \nchat bots or anything so i think but i \nthink with re-ranking you've already \nkind of filtered down the action space \nto these \nuh like one 1000 or 100 that come from \nthe course because it's like information \nretrieval and then it's like the \nrefinement stage so there's like it's \nlike this pipeline where we're seeing \ninformation retrieval and supervised \nlearning or say reinforcement learning \nbut like this kind of uh \nstages of \ncoarse-grained fine-grained optimization \nkind of \nand exactly \nyou know i love that topic of like um \ninformation retrieval and supervised \nlearning but before before i go getting \ntoo off the rails with that \nso i really want to talk about the \nknowledge graph at uh kenius and because \nit's so interesting that um that you're \nusing the citation network instead of \nsay the um the text embeddings that \nwould come from like siamese bert and so \nagain tell me about like generally how \nyou think about graph embeddings and \nthen the things that go into thinking \nabout building this yeah so for for this \nknowledge graph part uh part of kenya's \nresearch we're using uh knowledge graph \nembeddings \nand you know i probably got into i \nstarted using knowledge graph or like \nlearning about knowledge graph \nembeddings about like a year a year and \na half ago \nand i just found them like \nso fascinating the same i found them \njust as fascinating as i found \ntext and document embeddings maybe three \nthree years ago it got me probably more \nexcited \nand the reason i think it's so exciting \nis that knowledge graphs \nare a really \ngreat abstraction around data because \nthis is how i've come to understand \nknowledge graphs and that any data set \ncan really be abstracted to a knowledge \ngraph it's just it's really just kind of \nan arbitrary way a very useful way of \nmodeling modeling data \nin a graph like structure that we \nunderstand that can be multi-entity \nmulti-relational \nwhatever you have so \nit's a very it's a very interesting way \nof modeling data and because \nwe \nhumans are very good at understanding \nthese knowledge graphs and that model \nwe've learned to build these knowledge \ngraph embedding algorithms off of those \nand what was so fascinating to me was \nthat \nthat these embeddings could kind of feed \noff of \nall the different entities within uh \nkind of a really \nrelated graph and that they could \nevery embedding it's not just it's not \nlike in text where that's the only \ninformation it has is the text it has it \ncan have so much context \nimbued into the latent into latent space \nfrom you know so many different elements \nthat these embeddings are just the \npotential for richness from them was \nhuge huge for me and \nyou know in terms of if i think \nif i think of what's the \nkind of one of the greatest features in \nsearch i think knowledge graph \nembeddings have to be up there because \nagain going back to that problem of \ntext text embeddings and document \nembeddings are so powerful and so \namazing and we really learned so much \nabout embedding search from those but \nnot every organization or company or \nindividual has these super super rich \ntext data sets but i'd be willing to bet \nthat most companies and organizations \nhave fairly rich \nyou know populated data tables and like \nthat's that's that's where the meat of a \nlot of companies data is it's actually \nin these tabular data sets that are you \nknow they're if even if they're tabular \nthey're they're you those can be that \ncan be abstracted to knowledge graphs \nbecause that's all knowledge graphs are \nit's an abstraction so \nif you can imagine your data set as \na \nknowledge graph well then you can \nformulate a training process to turn \nthat knowledge graph into embeddings and \nthen you can turn every entity \nin your knowledge graph into a \nsearchable embedding which means you \ncould do something like what like what \nwe can do is you can get an author and \nyou can search papers from an author or \nyou can search authors from from authors \nand you can do all this end to end \nrelational searches from any entity to \nany other entity \nso kind of for me \nthe potentials there are fairly \nfairly limitless because you can kind of \nstart to do these really cool queries \nthat you could just never do before with \nwith it with entities and you can \nlike kind of the same way word \nembeddings work you know the uh \nman plus \nman plus uh \nqueen is equal to king you know just \nwith the same word embedding idea there \nis this \nkind of additive and like average \nembedding factor where you can you can \nfind like the an average embedding for \nyou know two two types of entities and \nthen search off of that so that you can \nif they're a really really amazing \nand the entities embeddings are a really \namazing tool to kind of conduct \nkind of \nso many different types of searches off \nof and i just find that really really \ninteresting \num and i think what's happened maybe the \nlast four or five years \nis there's just been tons and tons of \nresearch being published on \num models uh kind of \nmodels for graph embeddings and they're \nyou know they're only getting better \num and it \nwhat from what i've seen in maybe the \nlast 18 months is there's just been an \nexplosion about you know graph neural \nnetworks is slightly different the it's \nkind of there's a bit of confusion with \ngraph neural networks but the two fields \nare combining \nand the graph embedding space has really \npicked up and there's just some really \ngreat work being done there and \nespecially with the multi-entity stuff i \nthink that's really really interesting \nyeah so it's such a general framework \nand i'm even i'm having a hard time \nwrapping my head around kind of the \nscope of these i think ontologies as \nthey call them where you're just like as \nyou mentioned like you you we have these \nsql tables where say you you have like a \npurchasing table and you link it with a \nkey id to go get the item table and then \nsay like a customer database table as we \nhave these kinds of linkings in these \nrelational database systems and you \ncould turn any of this into a knowledge \ngraph where the um the edges that link \nthe product keys between sql tables say \nthat's like a \ndifferent kind of relational edge and \nthen they form these big uh graphs do \nyou have like a motivating example of \nwhat an ontology looks like for \nscientific literature mining like i \ncould imagine i have a collection of \npapers and maybe they linked to like an \norganization id \nlike say they were published in eurips \nor icml and or maybe they were they're \nlinked to some \nuh like topic \nlike what are the what are the \nontologies look like for literature \nmining yeah so here's here's our \nontology like you know the basic um \nkind of academic graph um \nso you have entities so i would say the \nkind of the primary entities in an \nacademic graph are papers uh or journals \nuh \npapers or publications so that's one \ntype of entity um \nand then you have \nuh journals so where the where the \npapers are are published you have \nauthors people that write the paper so \nall of these you can kind of see in a \nway there all of these entities starting \nto revolve around the the paper entity \nbecause that's kind of the first class \ncitizen maybe of this one that doesn't \nalways need to be the case so you've \npapers you've authors your journals um \nand then you might have concepts so a \nlot of a lot of papers are tagged with \nmetadata the way a film would be tagged \nwith a genre so \num attention is all you need might be \ntagged as computer science \nas kind of the high level concept and \nthen it might get natural language \nprocessing and artificial intelligence \nas the next layer maybe linguistics and \nthen you might start seeing stuff about \nthe encoder decoder architecture that's \ngetting like \nthat's getting down on a lower level so \nnow all of a sudden the the paper \nattention all you need has \nauthor x and y \nand has uh has the field of study or \nconcepts uh computer science uh natural \nlanguage processing and so on and then \nthe the paper might be \npublished at a conference so a \nconference becomes another \num conference can become another entity \num \nso and that's just that's a very basic \nkind of description of maybe an ontology \nwith five five different entities and \nthen all those entities can relate to \neach other in different ways \nso and then you know there's \nthere's so many different like mini \nentities you can add into this ontology \nand you can even have \num \ntwo entities can have two different \ntypes of two or more different types of \nrelations between them so you know and \ndirect relations don't need to be \nsymmetrical they can be asymmetrical so \nand the ac the asymmetry is also \nimportant when you're modeling these \nembeddings because you know you don't \nwant to imply \nsometimes that asymmetry is just as \nimportant to imply that something that \nsomething in a network doesn't flow the \nother direction you know just because \neyesight attention is all you need does \nnot mean that i wrote it \nyeah \nyeah i also really like like with that \nline of thinking like causal graphs and \nthinking about like putting the causal \ndags into graph neural networks and that \nkind of thinking is really exciting \nso one kind of question i have about \nthis is like we know that deep learning \ngenerally with small data sets doesn't \nwork that well so do you need so then as \nwe're looking at this graph data are you \ngoing to need like a massive set of node \ntypes and a massive set of entity \nrelations to kind of make deep learning \nwork well with this kind of thing there \nis something interesting about \nuh this is something i personally i i \nhaven't read any research about this but \ni have been thinking about this in terms \nof knowledge graph embeddings which is \nthat \nmaybe overfitting isn't so much a \nproblem \nwith small graphs because and here's \nhere's the way i think about that in \nthat \noverfitting might not be as much as a \nproblem with a a small data set because \nwith a lot of knowledge graph um \nembeddings you can't you know if a new \nentity gets introduced to the graph \nyou have to you typically have to \nremodel everything you have to \nrebuild the model because it's very \nevery model every entity um \nevery additional entity has to be added \nto the \nto the total embedding so that \nit just doesn't work you have to pretty \nmuch remodel redo the model when as new \nentities are added so \ngetting back to it \noverfitting might not be such a bad \nproblem with a small data set because \nwhat you really want is just to find the \nbest the best embeddings to solve this \ntypically the prediction task is like \nyou have a head relation and tail and \nit's like predict the tail given ahead \nin relation so \nyou know if you're \nif you're \nas you're building these models if let's \nsay the validation and test results are \ncoming out good and you know having \nscoring well on all your all your \nranking metrics well then that means \nthat your embeddings are you know \nrepresentative and rich \nso in a sense because it's kind of a \nclosed world of your just all the \nentities in your embeddings it's not \nlike new text is coming in as you might \nhave in a sentiment classification tasks \nlike these are your entities so whether \nit's like 30 000 or 30 million like this \nis the entity embedding of your of your \nentire world \nlike so to speak so in that case i think \nit's kind of interest i've been thinking \nabout this recently that overfitting is \nokay or not \nthe model having a small set of data \nis kind of okay because if it's learning \nif it's learning those representations \nand it's it's searching \nwell around that space well then maybe \nthat's good enough maybe that's all you \nneed \nso and you know i've had some kind of \nfun side projects where i've you know \nonly had 30 000 \n30 000 or so funnily enough um entities \nand \nit's been pretty good from what i've \nseen \nyeah i think there are definitely \napplications where overfitting is is \neven the goal like like when you're \ntrying to compress images with deep \nneural networks overfitting is great \nyeah like um auto encoders if you over \nfit it but then you have a that you can \nget a latent space from the overfitting \nthat's useful but i guess what i was \ntrying to get at is is and you talked \nabout it quickly with this i think the \nword they use to describe this is open \nset classification so if you take like \nthe canonical deep learning example of \ncfar 10 where you classify images into \nlike deership frog bird \nthat and then you you don't assume that \nthat there are going to be new classes \nadded it's going to be those 10 classes \nall the time \nwhereas i imagine these graphs and we \ntalk about scientific literature mining \nas the application you would imagine \nadding new node types so \nlike you want to have this flexible \ninterface where you add new node types \nnew edge types to keep this flexibility \nwhere you're saying uh like you just can \nimagine any kind of relation between two \nobjects kind of \nso i see it as kind of an open set \nclassification problem \nbut anyways maybe that is getting too \noff the track with kind of just thinking \nabout \ngraph data and the differences i see in \nkind of making these ontologies work \ncompared to kind of like the problems \nlike glue benchmark c410 and most of the \ndeep learning academic data sets so what \nhave been some of like the key \nchallenges in organizing this knowledge \ngraph i i saw you recently spoke about \npi torque big graph and i think \nthat that in itself is kind of alluding \nto what some of the biggest challenges \nhere and i think it a lot of it comes \ndown to a lot of these tools are a lot \nof the knowledge graph embedding tools \nare kind of in their infancy \nthey're not as they're not as kind of \nfeature-rich or \nyou know the community communities \naren't as big so probably the hardest \nthing i find with \nknowledge graph embeddings is \nkind of the some of the tooling around \nit like pretty much our entire system \nfor building our knowledge graph is \ncustom because you know we had so many \nwe had like so \nthere's 60 60 plus million entities but \nyou know you know how big citation \ngraphs are that you're talking like \nbillions of edges between all of the the \nauthors and papers \nso \nthat gets really tricky to do um and \neven just building those edge lists and \nbuild building those headsets um it \ntakes like we're lucky to have a big \nwork kind of a or work workhorse machine \num that we use and it can store all that \nstuff in memory but it took a lot of \noptimization to get it there and then \nyou know with the the graph training \nit's it takes up a lot of a you have to \nyou have to when you're training these \ngraphs you have to hold the entire thing \nin memory so \nyou know you're if you're talking like \n500 \nlike uh embeddings of 500 dimensions for \neach entity well then that's under 60 \nmillion that's 500 multiplied by 60 \nmillion multiplied by 32 or 64 bit and \nit starts it starts to hog memory pretty \nfast \num \nand the problem is you have to typically \nhave all of these entities in memory \nsomewhere it's not like \nin in some \nuh language modeling tasks where you can \nmini batch it you kind of you always \nhave to have \nins either in a in gpu or cpu remember \nin those memories have all those \nentities ready to go and as well as the \nrelations \num so honestly the hardest part about \nthis task right now is \num \njust the pipeline like \nkind of efficiently designing these \npipelines and i think you know that's \nwhere \nwe're really happy where we got that too \nand it was it was \nthat was like \n80 of my work to get it to that point \nyou know that we knew that we pretty \nmuch knew that we could build the \nstructure you know the models would \nit was a you know a pretty we knew that \nthe models would find the relations \nbetween the academic graph you know \nthat's kind of a proven problem so we \nknew we could get it there \nbut that the trick was just setting up \nthe infrastructure and i think you know \nthat's the greater problem at hand and \nmost machine learning problems these \ndays is good infrastructure and \nyou know i sometimes i don't think \nenough uh \ntime is given to in terms of tuning to \njust like oh how do you how do you build \nan edge list of three billion edges and \nlike load that into memory fast and how \nand how how do you how do you add custom \nfiltering onto that to add some rules \nand you know we had to learn a lot of \nthat um and it's a it's a really \nimportant part probably the most \nimportant step because if you make \nlittle mistakes there or the script that \ndoes it is inefficient and \nthere's data loss well then you're in \ntrouble so yeah the the hardest part for \nus was infrastructure and you know we \nactually as i spoke about pie torch big \ngraph we initially started off using \nthat tool but actually moved away from \nit just because \num it was really really really great too \nbut the \nyou know the the the documentation \nwasn't so up to date anymore and the the \ncommunity \nit's not been fully maintained and you \nknow we couldn't take on \nuh \nwe it was kind of a risk if we maybe \ntook on something like pi torch big \ngraph and it it's not going to be \nmaintained going forward then we need to \nkeep this graph up to date so \num you have to make choices like that \nso with the infrastructure is it like \nmostly these distributed like data \nsharding model partitioning kind of or \nlike um i guess just embedding table \nit's not really like a model right with \nthese kind of algorithms \nyeah it's it's the it's the distributed \nnature of doing it and at in the end we \nwere like just about by the skin of our \nteeth able to \num \navoid doing a distributed setup for \ntraining \nthe the knowledge graph but we know \nthat's not \nthat's not going to be the case going \nforward because our data sets increasing \nso fast so we needed to kind of find \nfind tools that are ready to go in terms \nof \nbeing distributed so \nyeah that that's what was really \nimportant um and there's there's \nactually some really cool work out there \nin terms of that kind of big graph like \nyou know billions of entity learning and \nlike by george big graph of course is up \nthere you know there it is it does do \nthat there's just a bit of trepidation \nas to whether how long it would be \ncontinually going super cool i just want \nto ask you a quick question about the \nnature of these graph embeddings and \nlike \nyou have to have the entire data set as \nthe input and that's kind of the nature \nof these of working with graph data \ncould you maybe do like \ni don't know if this like i haven't \nthought through this at all but like \nmaybe you have like a minimum spanning \ntree or maybe you can just \nkind of like isolate nodes and take a \nlot of it off of the input is would any \nof that kind of stuff work and then you \nhave the adjacency matrix right like um \nhave they really achieved like i they \ncall they talk about like permutation \nvariance to the adjacency matrices where \nyou scramble the orders and then you get \na totally different like kind of looking \none zero matrix with the \nthing does that kind of stuff work or \nand are you convinced these graph neural \nnetwork approaches or are you mostly \nlooking at like complex uh the pie torch \nbig graph the way that they do the just \nan embedding table it's not a sequential \nneural network \nyeah for \ni like \nfrom \nfrom what we've seen and used right now \nthe best results are coming from these \nkind of just tables like kind of complex \nrotate transient \nall of that family \nof embeddings where it's effectively a \nvery very very shallow network it's like \ndo you even consider it a neural network \nor is it just like a look up you know \nthat's a \nwhat but it works really well \ni think in the last two years or sorry \nsince 2020 which is two years \nunfortunately um is we've seen that \nthere is research coming out that's \ncombining graph neural network \napproaches \num the problem is it's it's adding way \nmore time to an already slow fairly slow \nprocess um in terms of \nwhat changes can be made can you do we \nalways need to store the entities in \nin memory \ni i'd like to think not i don't i'm not \nreally sure like what's being done in \nresearch right now in terms of \nlike counteracting that i'd love if \nthere were solutions like that work that \neventually do kind of solve that a \nlittle bit better because it is \nit kind of makes it prohibitive to a lot \nof people that want to just get started \nyou know if they have a large data set \nand they want to build a knowledge graph \nembedding you know they might need a \nmachine with like you know 100 gigs of \nram you know not everyone has that \num \nand then in terms even in terms of just \nhosting those things in in production \nit's very expensive to \nprovision machines of that size so \nyeah i don't know \nwhat the what what's ahead for like kind \nof these knowledge graph embedding \nmethods whether they're going to focus \non improving the actual just the \nthe \nkind of the the scoring functions and \nkind of just improving the quality of \nthe embeddings or if they're going to \nfigure out a way to optimize the how \nthey actually like do it whether it's \nlike a mini batch approach or whatever \num obviously with the with the sharded \napproach what is cool about you know \ndoing the sharding is \nyou can of course theoretically \ntrain on a graph of any size you just \nadd an add a new shard \nbut again you can only do that if the \nthe size of the data set is still if \nit's a thousand gigabytes in memory well \nthen it's just a thousand gigabytes \nstarted up 10 times into on like \nso either way right now \nas things stand \nit's you're storing everything in memory \nso \nyeah i don't i hope it would be amazing \nif we kind of move into an approach \nwhere you can kind of batch it to some \ndegree but i \ni'm not sure if \nwhere kind of the research stands on \nthat right now \nwell do you like the uh like deep walk \nor no to vect style of uh you just walk \nthrough the neighborhood to get sort of \nlike a self-supervised learning \nobjective where the goal is to predict \nyour neighbors such that you can kind of \nbatch it up and isolate the node \nembeddings \nyeah the the notes of echo idea is is \nreally cool you know it's very you know \ncoming from natural language processing \nit it it kind of works \nit's very intuitive to to understand it \nfrom what i know though is no no to vec \nand deep walk to date haven't had kind \nof the same results as kind of complex \nand rotate and these very specific \num \nuh k knowledge graph embedding \nmethodologies um but yeah you know \nthat's not to say that you couldn't use \nsome sort of graph neural network a \nhybrid approach to to actually do \nexactly that to like to you just feed in \nfeed in sub graphs as input and then use \nthose sub graphs to \nstart predicting it like adjacency and \nall of that kind of stuff yeah i think \nmaybe an interesting research idea would \nbe like because in uh transient complex \nyou have the contrastive alignment that \nhelps with embedding learning so maybe \nit with deep walk if you did uh like so \nwhat it is if people aren't familiar is \nit's you are in a graph and you like \nkind of flip a dice and uh or roll a \ndice and then you traverse the edges to \njust keep doing random walking along the \ngraph maybe you would have the positive \npairs like if you do three traversals \nand the negative pairs are like 8 10 you \nknow like \nk and n to do the two parameters and \nmaybe then having the contrastive \nlearning objective would be something \nthat deep walk is currently missing but \nyeah deep deep walk sounds nice because \nyou don't have to put the whole graph \ninto the \nmemory and it sounds like that's \nsomething that's given you a headache \nyeah it doesn't sound fun \nwell yeah that's exactly i'd i'd really \nlove if that's the way \nif with deep water that's the way things \ncould go um it would be really amazing \nbecause it would just speed up training \nso much because the the problem is a lot \nof a lot of um \ngraph embedding models are actually done \non cpu because \nyou use the machines typically you use \nthe entire machines \nram to store all the embeddings and then \neven \neven let's say any any of the the \napproaches that are using gpus it's \nusually a hybrid mix of like well the \nthe embeddings are in uh kind of just \nthe machines normal ram and then we sub \nbatch some of them into \ninto the gpus ram but you know there's \nnot a lot of gps out there with kind of \n100 gigs plus of ram so you're going to \nneed like an array of them \nso yeah if you can do this this mini \nbatch you know like effectively just \npumping in like sub graphs \nin as the batches into it that would be \nlike a super super elegant approach so \nas i said you know i'm if i hope that \nresearch comes out in the in the next \ncouple years will be greatly helpful to \nme so if there's any uh \nresearchers thinking about working on \nthat that would be really amazing \nyeah \nyeah so so so many interesting topics \naround graph learning and um so kind of \ntransitioning into the webv8 vector \nsearch engine and before we get \nparticularly into uh how you've used it \nin your experience with it i think kind \nof staying on this topic of the graphs \nwe recently had two web demos of \nwikidata and wikipedia so how do you \nthink about just from a high level like \nof the embeddings and the differences \nbetween what you would learn from \nwikidata and doing say pytorch big graph \ncomplex these kind of algorithms on the \nwiki data embeddings compared to \nwikipedia where you say siamese bird to \ncontrast sentences and overall think \nabout what what you would do with neural \nsearch for those two kinds of data sets \nwell the wiki data in data set is a \nreally great example to work from \nbecause it's it's it's a natural \nontology it the ontology is perfectly \nstructured to do \nto to build probably you know the \nrichest knowledge graph um \nembeddings possible and that's you know \nthat's what wiki data do provide you \nknow that's how wikipedia is part of \nthey they power their own knowledge \ngraph using using that ontology so \nit's a what you described there's a \nreally nice way of talking about the \nbenefits of both because you know it's \nshowing that \nyou you use it's using your data in the \nright way and squeezing the most out of \nyour data so with wikidata \nyou you have this natural hierarchy and \nontology and \nrelatedness between \ntopics concepts classes uh individuals \nso \nthe whole modeling is done in this kind \nof graph like structure so you of course \nwill when you're building your knowledge \ngraph embeddings you'll exploit that \ngraph structure and you'll build your \nyour edge list \nbased off of that and then you'll train \nyour model to predict on these tasks and \nthen you can do novel novel entity \nuh this uh kind of uh discovery via \nthose learned embeddings so you know you \nmight discover you know the the \nfootballer cristiano ronaldo even though \nimagine in a world where he's never been \nrelated to manchester united might get \nlinked through you know they have \nsimilar \nyou know managers or teams that he's \nplayed for that those kind of things \nwill \nappear um so yeah and then with the \njust the wikipedia what's amazing is you \nsee \nyou know just the power of document and \nsemantic embeddings with text \nand again it just show it it really it \nkind of comes down to like what's your \ninput \nwhat what inputs do you have at hand and \nthen what's your expected output because \nyou know \nuh in \nand then you just this is how we look at \nsearch it's like it's kind of they're \nall coalescing into one and that you \nknow you might have a search query \ntherefore you'd like text to work with \ntherefore you search wikipedia for text \nand you'll find things that are \nsemantically related there but if you \ncan identify an actual concrete entity \nwell then the richer search studio might \njust be to search on that entity \nso i think really what the two show is \nthat \nthey're both like the entity embeddings \nand these like latent embedding methods \nthat we've developed over the last 10 10 \nor so years or even longer of course \ni they're kind of all distilling down to \nthe same thing to the point that you \nknow you can use entity embeddings to \nimprove the quality of a language model \nand you can use language model \nembeddings to improve the quality of \nknowledge knowledge knowledge graphic so \nreally \nall of these embeddings are just kind of \ndescribing like that we we've learned \nways to model kind of semantic \nrelationships \nfor any type of input or entity and you \nknow this is extending just beyond uh \nknowledge graphs and \ntext but also to images and to sound you \nknow any modality can be embed into a \nlatent space and you can search off of \nthat \nyeah like uh the multi-modal learning \nthing is so interesting but i think \nparticularly the relationship between \ngraphs and text is one of the most \ninteresting ones to study right now \nso i mean yeah this idea sounds so great \nbeing like this is an entity-centric \nquery let's go get the graph embedding \nfor this one it's particularly useful \nfor this one but have you seen do you \nhave any like um references or anything \nthat stood out on some example where \nthey really do really bring this to life \ni've seen \nmy favorite one is really where they \ntraverse the knowledge graphs to create \nnatural language sentences and just use \nthat as training data for the language \nmodel it's \nit's \nit's a little bit of like a naive kind \nof data augmentation strategy but to me \nit's the paper the paper is titled uh \nturning tables and then some other \ndescription but that's the high level \nthing if you want to search it anyone \nlistening but so basically you traverse \nthe knowledge graphs to form sentences \nand the sentences of the training data \nfor the language model \none kind of interface for the two things \nbut like so so what you're describing is \nlike a late fusion technique where you \nhave the two embeddings and then later \nthey come together and or some kind of \nquery model says let me see the graph \nembeddings for this particular one one \nthing i think that i've noticed going on \nwith a couple of search or \nrecommendation systems i use both like \nyou know google or something like \nspotify i a lot of those engines tend to \nhave if you put in let's say \nif you type in a particular artist into \nspotify or let's say an actor ben \naffleck into google if they can \nif you search and they can relate that \nentity with a very very high confidence \nto an actual like like via text so like \nvia those two words just like ben \naffleck that the entity ben affleck \nexists exactly as it looks or like \nwithin a very very high confidence score \nthis is that entity well then they just \nconduct they'll do their tech search and \nthen they'll conduct a knowledge graph \nsearch \non that entity to find all of that nice \nrich metadata you see over on the \nright-hand side and that's really the \npower of the two and it's the same in \nspotify where you know if you're typing \nin a musician or a song or something \nlike that they they do mix these \nmodalities where they'll use text that \nyou're they'll turn your text query into \nan entity search in the background \nbecause you know they can relate it to \nbeing a concrete entity um and that's \ni think that's you know that's kind of \nshowing \nthat you know knowledge knowledge graph \nsearch \ncan be realized in many ways you know \nall you need to do is get those \nembeddings and then you just need to \nfigure out ways to you know \nof course you can't always guarantee \nthat your user is going to like select \nthe entity for you but you know they \nmight they might do it via a query and \nif you can of course if you can find \nthat entity in some way or another you \nshould search on that because the entity \nembeddings tend to be very rich like we \nwere discussing earlier on because it's \nthis kind of closed world and \nthey're allowed to overfit \num \nso yeah that's kind of how i think about \ni've noticed like a lot of a lot of \nsearch engines typically do tend to do \nthat these days they tend to like to mix \nthat \nmakes the two or in the background kind \nof silently resolve to an entity if one \nexists and the same with genres you know \nif you type in a genre into \ninto into these libraries they'll find \nkind of the artists and the songs that \nrevolve or exist within that within that \nsphere \nyeah super cool that that definitely \nmakes a lot of sense and it seems like \nsuch an exciting area and i i like the \nspotify example a lot because of the \nsimilar to wiki day i guess similar to \nthe scientific papers too but it really \nhelps you visualize this concept of kind \nof like entity \ncentric searching so so now can you \ndescribe you have your graph embeddings \nand can you describe your experience \nwith using the wva vector search engine \nto search through the graph embeddings \nand i really like one of my favorite \nthings about your article describing \nthis is how you describe how the api \nlets you rotate in plug and play the \ndifferent components like you can swap \nout your embedding model swap out your a \nn index and that's also something that i \nthink is awesome about wv8 \nyeah so you know we've been \nonce we earlier like it's pretty much \nsince we've had these embeddings uh \ntrained and you know ready to deploy we \nwere like okay what's the next step well \nit's just not going to be possible to do \na \nbrute force search of like 60 million \nplus embeddings in \nunder two seconds or under a second \nwhatever we need \nso of course it was going to be um a n \nbut you know there there was a lot of \noptions there's a lot of options out \nthere to choose from but what really \njust you know we really stood stood out \nfor us \nwith just because of like you know a \ncouple of it's not because of one thing \nbut because a couple of really key \nfeatures \nand i think what all these key features \nkind of allude to is that you know the \nweave the whole design of a vb8 search \nengine \nis \nis designed for business problems like \nours like they're not just trying to \ntheoretically do \nvector search \nlike straight vector search they \nunderstand that vector search is never \njust you know a flat vector search \nthere's often going to be cases where uh \npost filtering is gonna or pre-filtering \nmight be needed \nand \nthat use case is just the the api is \njust so well designed to those use cases \nthat it became really attractive so \nyou know \num and then we also needed we needed \nthis thing to be scalable like kind of \nhorizontally we knew \ni we had experienced using h and sw but \nyou know \nthere whether we could fit this all in \none machine would be was kind of up in \nthe air and then you know by the right \nnow as i speak from as of today you know \nwb8 is horizontally distributed back \nthen it was \njust about maybe it was on the roadmap \nbut you know from what we had seen from \nthe team and stuff like that they were \njust moving so fast we had \nso much confidence that they were going \nto get there when by the time we would \nbe going live with them that's kind of \nexactly what happened which was amazing \nbut \nyeah we v8 is really it's exactly what \nvector search needs which is \na really really practical useful user \napi where \num this the core parts of the system are \nare really set in stone but they have \nthey take this modular approach \nspecifically \nwith the uh a n indexes and i think \nwhat's really useful about that is you \nknow if we think of \nkeyword search and a lot of keyword \nsearch engines that are out there some \nof them are kind of stuck in the mud in \nterms of using like older \nolder algorithms just because \nuh 20 15 years ago the initial code base \nwas designed and it wasn't designed \nmaybe in a super modular way so \nswitching out these ranking algorithms \nor whatever it is was difficult whereas \nwev8 is really interesting because \nvector vector search is again and \nprobably still only in its infancy you \nknow what the \nthe a n indices that we use \ntoday probably in five years will be \nwell \ncompletely outdated \nand \nthat built that that knowledge is built \ninto the the architecture of we v8 so \nthat like gives you so much confidence \nthat like if when the new latest and \ngreatest um \na n index comes out or a n strategy \ncomes out we don't need to \nwe're not going to have to like rebuild \neverything or rethink our entire \narchitecture we're just going to like \nplug and play and that's like \nthat having that confidence in the the \nsearch engine you use is like incredible \nlike it's it's so so useful to have that \nand to have that you know as a as a \ncompany that's trying to scale just to \nto to know that \nwe're not gonna have to like spend \nlike hundreds of hours of engineering \ntime again solving this problem that you \nknow when the feature is ready we'll \njust it might be like a couple of lines \nor a config yaml change just to point to \nthis new and rebuild on this new index \nso that's like you know that's that was \nsuch a win in of itself \nand then it is we're pointing out that \nyou know with the the filtering system \nthe scalar filtering system that's done \non the index is \nvery very elegant because it's it's not \na post search filter it's a pre-search \nfilter \nand how they that's that was what we \nreally wanted because we had looked at \nyou know we could have developed our own \nin-house system that did post search \nfiltering but that's not really what we \nwanted we wanted pre-search where they \nwould have an allow list and a set list \nof entities that would be allowed to be \nin the search and then rank according \nand retrieve according to that way \nbecause \nyour much higher chance of getting back \nif we ask for a thousand a thousand \nvectors or a thousand objects we have a \nmuch higher chance of getting back a \nthousand with the pre-filter rather than \nthe post so that was very important \nbecause you know if you're building a \nsearch engine you kind of want to \nguarantee that you're going to give at \nleast a page of results to a user \num so that was really that was really \nreally amazing to see that \nand then you know there's you know while \nwe're using \nrev8 primarily right now for uh the \nknowledge graph embeddings that we've \nbeen testing out some really fun um kind \nof future future projects with it in the \ntext in the tech space and you know \nthey've it's really helped us re we we \nhad this kind of crazy idea almost just \na couple of weeks ago and we're like \nokay let's see if we can spec this out \nreally fast and we know \nwith just a single weekend hack for me i \nwas able to kind of put it together and \ni kind of show an early proof of concept \njust using wev8 \nand it's because of the the module \nsystem in terms of uh you know text to \ntransformers you know that that \nentire pipeline just saves so much \nboilerplate code and so much like \nthinking that you'd have to do as a \nmachine or an engineer just to to get a \nproject up and running and you can \nreally kind of move fast \nand because because of that modular \nsystem \nit kind of has two advantages one is \nthat you can you can build a module once \nand then it just \nyou don't have to worry about like where \nthe inference is coming from and you can \ninteract with the api very humanly you \ncan just feed it in text you don't need \nto do this transformation step of \nturning that text into a vector yourself \nbecause vb8 handles that and it's \nincredible \nbut also you know \njust from an open source point of view \nthe fact that these modules can be can \nactually work just be \ncontributed as an open source \ncontribution \nyou know there's a lot of open source \nprojects out there that are open source \nin terms of the project is open source \nbut there's a team working on it the vba \nteam are open source and like \ni have to say they welcome the community \nwith open arms in a very very true open \nopen source fashion and that's very \nattractive for me \num to kind of when i'm deciding on these \nthings and and also to contribute to you \nknow it's it's been fun to contribute \nwhere i can to ev8 because it's a very \nwelcoming community \nyou know bob and etienne and everyone \nthere are very \nvery welcoming \nyeah and to stay on the ver yeah it \nreally reminds me of hugging face how \nwell you can switch out the components \nand i think just yesterday deepmind had \nreleased two papers where one of them is \na 280 billion parameter language model \nand that probably got most of the \nattention because of you know 280 \nbillion parameter model but the other \npaper they they published was about \ninformation retrieval \nplus supervised learning and so we've \neight is in my view the the perfect \nplatform for testing these ideas of \ncombining information retrieval and then \nsupervised learning so you retrieve \ndocuments and then you append on your \nquestion answering system and \nthis modularity if you want to swipe out \nthe embedding model for the information \nretrieval you just point to a different \nhugging face model path if you want to \nswipe out the a n index same idea just \ndrag and drop h sw something else and \nthen if you want to replace the \ndownstream question answering thing \nsame idea just to point to another set \nuh it's you know it's it's simple when \nyou think about it but the way they've \nimplemented it you know it they've made \nit seem simple but \nit they've really done like you know \nsome really great work to get it to that \npoint and you you can tell how much kind \nof thought has been put into the \narchitecture and then how passionate \nthey all are in in what they're working \nwith and \nit is a very good community to be a part \nof and there's not all open source \ncommunities i like that and it it takes \na lot of work to build that kind of \ncommunity and i i i really really \nappreciate it and it's very fun \nto engage with them then and to you know \nlike there have literally been \nreleases that solve \nmy problem like my specific problem \nthere was a release that fixed that and \nlike that's just incredible to to \nto feel that \nyou know i presented a uh with some sort \nof problem and then my work alongside \nethiopian \nand it gets solved via release you know \nthat that's very special to to be able \nto have that kind of help \num when when you're building with these \ntools um \nand you know it's just as you were \nsaying that in terms of yeah you can \nswitch it out you know the vector search \nis here to stay in it it's it's only \ngoing to become \nuh bigger \nso \nwe're going to need some really good \nvector search solutions and from what \ni've seen so far like vv8 is by far kind \nof the most feature-rich \nthat that there is and the the the \neasiest to interact with and that's down \nfrom like you know the api design would \nbe a graphql down to its optimization in \nits back-end you know it's \nit's written in go which is which i \nthink is a hugely under-appreciated \nlanguage in terms of machine learning \nyeah the applications in machine \nlearning \ni've thought could be really really \nuseful not maybe not in terms of \nexplicit like modeling or training but \nin terms of infrastructure and terms \nlike you know vector search like they're \ndoing i think \nthey really understand \nwhat the strengths and weaknesses or \nsomething like go around that point in \nin that world and yeah they've they've \nreally done a great job with it \nyeah if we could stay on the like \nlike go and rust and these kind of \nthings is something that i can't help at \nall because i don't know too much about \nbut if we get just like i just want to \nget a little more into the vector \nsolutions and kind of the conceptual \nidea \nof uh like the h and sw algorithm and if \nyou wouldn't mind if i could kind of \nlike explain my understanding of hsw \nfrom scratch and you could explain to me \nhow the pre-filtering thing works so \nfrom the high level overview with these \na n index algorithms we have continuous \nvector embeddings for everything in our \ndata set and we want to try to do say \nthe brute force solution is to do the \ndot product comparison with every single \nvector and obviously we want to avoid \ndoing that so we say a naive algorithm \nwould be to do a k-means clustering \nwhere you have a centroid that \nrepresents that routes you to like \nyou're most similar to this centroid so \ngo look through this \nuh you know the cluster vectors that \nproduce that centroid in the k-means \nalgorithm so the way that i understand h \nand sw is that you build up these \ncentroids and then you connect the \ncentroids in a graph \nsuch that you can use the small world \nnetwork effect to say that \ni'm likely six hops away from the \ncentroid i need to get to \nso is so that's kind of as far as i \nunderstand h sw how does the symbolic \nfiltering work with that \nyeah and so i think with in terms of the \nh and sw then what you have is on top of \nthe on top of the navigable navigable \nsmall world graph it's like it layers it \nlike an onion so it's like \nyou you can kind of it gets \nit kind of saves you time and \nkind of com compute by each level as you \ntraverse down is \nlike \nthe top levels are pretty sparse \nso because they're virus they can kind \nof find pretty quickly what the the the \nshortest distances to your to your query \nare and then every every s that like \ndownward layer starts to is more \npopulated \nso you can kind of \npick a pick a few candidates from each \nlayer of the onions so to speak and kind \nof find which one find which vectors are \nclosest to it \nand then \nkind of decide \npick on the two best routes down down \nthat avenue of uh layers and which roots \nare going to be uh are scoring highest \nand then just pick the name the \nneighbors attached below that in each \npart of the graph that's on a high level \nbut in terms of how i how i think the \nfrom what i've seen in the code and how \nthe pre-filtering is done is \nimagine \nuh in terms of post filtering you were \nto do a query and you wanted it to be \num \nif it's papers published let's say \nacademic papers you wanted papers \npublished \nfrom the year 2018 onwards well in a \npost filtering world what would happen \nis you do your do your search get back \nhere \nthe top 1000 results and then you post \nfilter you'd actually retrieve the data \nobjects \nand you'd retrieve the data objects \nand then you'd filter that set of a \nthousand to be \num \nyou'd filter that set of a thousand and \nthen you might be left with like \n200 papers um left and then \nunfortunately what's happened is you've \nasked for a thousand papers and you've \ngot 200 because you've applied your \nfilter post fact \nwith the pre-filtering \nwhat the way i think they've done it is \nyou have your query and it what it does \nis it \nyou execute your filter \nfirst in terms of okay \nthis has to have an allow like this has \nto be from the year uh 2018 onwards so \nthat creates what's called like an allow \nlist right it retrieves like a list of \nids that meet that criteria so now as \nyou start to traverse the traverse the \ngraph \nwhat you do is \nyou pick your you pick your nodes along \nthat in the in the h and sw graph from \nall the layers down and as you hit a \nnode your first test \ndoesn't meet the criteria \nand if it meets the criteria great you \ncan look at the node and all its \nneighboring nodes \nbut if not you have to you can you \npretty much add that node to like a skip \nlist and you skip it \nand you keep trying to fill up the \nresult set until you have a thousand so \nthe idea is that you're you're skipping \nones that don't meet that like allow \nlist and you're you're finding the next \nnearest ones after that because you \nhaven't asked for a filter so the filter \nmight get rid of some really relevant \npapers or results but you you do have an \nexplicit scalar filter so that's okay \nyou so you just you fill up that result \nset \nwith the next 1000 results that would \nlike \nthat would have been um kind of right \nafter that according to that filter so \nthat's why it's you know it's \nit's very powerful to be able to do that \nand as i said earlier especially when \nyou're designing like kind of a search \nengine solution like us where you're \ntrying to give as many results as \npossible and trying to keep that result \nspace um interesting \nhaving that pre-filtering super powerful \nthank you so much for that yeah i i got \ndefinitely a better sense of it now i \nthink that made it very clear i don't \nknow if that's like a perfect \ndescription of it but from what i've \nchatted with etienne about it that's \nlike the general gist but of course if \nthere's if they if they listen to this \nand they have any any extra thoughts \nplease feel free to free to contribute \nyeah yeah eddie has been explaining it \nto me and i will probably even ask him \nagain i just trying to get it you know i \ngotta keep hearing it to finally have it \nuh \ni don't know how he stores it all in his \nhead he is very uh he's very very uh \nwell read on hmsw and everything \nactually \nyeah yeah they're such a great team and \nso so to step a little away from wev8 \nand get back into scientific literature \nmining and kind of \ncould you kind of tell me like um you \nknow i also really like scientific \nliterature mining i think of what i do \nwith henry ai labs of doing paper \nreviews as being like a form of manual \nscientific literature mining and as i \nthink about it i try to think how could \ni automate these tasks i'm doing how \ncould i turn this into something that \nwould be like an automated system how do \nyou like what's motivated you to work on \nscientific literature mining in that big \npicture kind of thinking \nyeah i \ni suppose \nthe motivation \nthat i always \nkind of try and \nreally prioritize for myself \nis that \nit's as an undergrad it was really hard \nit was really hard to get started \nand and i \nthat's something we always try to \nemphasize our keynes kenius works for \nusers like we we try and design our \nproduct to be like here it's your first \nsemester of university to \nbe your your final year of your phd \num \nbut you know \nfor people early on in their academic \ncareers it can be really really hard to \nconceptualize like a space and like a a \nlike a topic or whatever it is you're \nworking on it it can be really hard to \nunderstand what that even encapsulates \nso for us \nwhat's really really exciting when we \nthink about academic search and \nresearch mining is figuring out a way \njust to \nto mine research and \nto \nto make it really intuitive to discover \ndiscover new things and you know earlier \non i brought up the kind of the \nwikipedia example where you know we've \nall been on wikipedia where \nyou go into like a black hole of \ndiscovering \ninformation about topics and \nyou can learn really fast and you can \nkind of dig down into different levels \nof granularity and that's what we try \nthat's what you know that's our north \nstar in terms of emulating that it's \nmaking like academia and topics and \nconcepts in academia \nkind of fun to explore \num \nand making that some \nmaking it so that we can enable someone \nin their first semester to get value out \nof uh out of academic publications \nbecause you know that it can \nit can be very intimidating academic \npublications can be really intimidating \nand it can be hard to look at a paper \nand to start working on it or start \nreading it or to to know even if it's \nrelevant so we feel that the sooner we \ncan get people comfortable with \ndiscovering papers and researching them \nand finding kind of the topics that \nthey're about the better you know it's \nit's it's good for researchers \neverywhere if everyone learns to kind of \nresearch a little bit better or \nunderstand what like what their own \ninterests what their field of research \nrevolves around you know \nso that's how that's kind of how we \nthink of think of it \ndo you think genius itself could become \na scientist \nlike it could have a text generation \nconnect to your system and it itself \nwould be a scientist \nyeah we've we've we've done some we've \nhad some fun with just uh text \ngeneration models just like internally \njust to play with and just to look at \neven just to the point of like abstract \ngeneration um \nit is quite cool \num i'm not sure if it's like \nif genius is ready just yet to like \ndo it itself but \nit can write some kind of like \nsemantically convincing abstracts if and \nand paper titles \num \nbut and you know there there is a \nserious use case from that and that you \ncould actually have a block of text and \nyou could suggest \nlike a title or you could suggest \num something like that off of off of a \ndocument so in that case is that \nconsidered writing science absolutely i \nwould say so you know titles are really \nimportant to finding papers but \nyeah i i think like \nprobably it's most efficient use cases \nlike just being a really good aide right \nnow to to to researchers of all kinds \nlike all levels \nand i saw one paper that was uh that \nreally stood out to me and further \ndeveloped my interest in this is titled \ncan we automate scientific reviewing and \nsimilar to what you just said they do \nthe same thing of this abstract was \nwritten by \nyou know our text generation models \nso so yeah i think especially things \nlike um survey papers literature reviews \nit does seem like something like genius \nor these models and implemented in \nkenya's are \nyou know maybe like five to ten years \naway from being able to do a survey \npaper literature review completely \nautomated \nso then so an idea that i've been \nworking on is um and i published a paper \ncalled keras burt which is where you \ntrain a language model on keras similar \nto the codex idea where you're trying to \nyou know write code with text generation \nmodels so trying to see if \nyou can plug the language model into \ncara like interface it with keras to \nwrite deep learning code and run deep \nlearning experiments \nwhere our data sets and all the ideas \nare completely digital anyways like if \nyou have to say do uh by like a biology \nexperiment where you have to have like a \nreal physical \nsay like maybe robot interacting with \nthe world i see that as being a slower \ninterface with this but as you do deep \nlearning research like the kenius ai \nscientist can write experiment code and \ndeep learning get the results and then \nlearn how to interpret the results and \nwrite papers and like be a scientist is \nthat where you think this is headed \nbecause that's that's where i think this \nis \ni i think you're right i don't think \nit's outside of the bounds of \npossibility that that's like where we're \ngoing and i i you said it earlier with \nthe systematic review that's like \nthat that to me would be \na really good \nkind of first \nattempt at like first attempt at \ntrying to see how good it is at that \ntask because \nyou want to kind of ease it into it \nright you don't want to like take on \nsomething too ambitious and you don't \nwant it to publish something that's just \nabsolute junk or just like completely \noff the bat but this is something like a \nreview a literature review that's like \nthat's manageable and like you know it's \nit's it it feels like a task where it \nwould be harder to mess that up once it \nonce it gets to that stage and \num yeah you know language generation \nstuff is getting really insane just with \nwhat it's getting i i saw that \npublication you were talking about \nyesterday i think the model is called \ngopher from deep mind and like the \noutput \nit was like the way it was like \nthe the \nin how informal it was in the \nconversation was just \ninsane um \nand so \ni think i'd be it'd be foolish to to say \nthat in the next 10 years we're not \ngoing to get \nsomewhere close to that point especially \nin terms of like a review literature \nreview i think that's kind of inevitable \nalmost with with ai text generation \nso yeah so in addition to the literature \nreviews where yeah it's like it's like \nthe product is the survey paper the \nintroduction to the topic for \nfor someone um so as someone with \nexperience building a software product \nand bringing this to like a real world \nsas kind of thing \nwhat do you think would go into say you \nknow reviewing your paper you you query \nlike the gbt3 api say or whatever \nwhatever the model is called and then \nyou're kind of building a sas product \naround automated scientific reviewing \nlike from your perspective what like and \ni think you have a different way of \nthinking about this because you have an \nactual software product and not just \nit's not just like research ideas so \nwhat do you think about that kind of \nproduct idea and what what it would take \nto bring that to life \nthat's interesting \nbecause i think \nacademics are like people are where of \ncourse people are uh creating these \nmodels and that \nthat they're you know the the advances \nhave been really good in terms of \nnatural language generation but \nacademics are also huge skeptics in \nterms of like accepting \naccepting what the output so \nthis is a trick and we've discovered \nthis you know we deal with academics a \nlot so you know you really have to prove \na \nproduct's worth in order to get it there \nso \ni don't know like i think you'd have to \nyou'd have to show that the product is \nlike \ncost saving or time saving in a really \nreally um \nin a way that's like kind of been unseen \nso whether it's like \nin terms of like reading giving \nsummaries of papers and reading them and \ngiving like um \nnot \nlike generated generated summaries \nbecause we've we've experimented with \nextractive summarization but abstract of \nsummarization is quite difficult and \nwhen we've experimented with that it's \nbeen pretty bad \num so i think \nif i if i saw in the next couple years \nthat abstractive summarization from like \nlarge language models was getting really \ngood that would be a killer use case \nbecause in that case what you're talking \nabout is you might actually be saving a \nresearcher like hours in terms of like \nhaving to dig through a papers um a 30 \npage paper and being able to like find \nits key points and letting it letting a \nresearcher like giving it a kind of deep \nnot just like an abs like not like just \nthe abstract but giving it like key \npoints from inside the paper about maybe \nlike what algorithms are being used or \nthat stuff that they could like ident \neffectively helping them identify what \nparts of a paper are relevant to their \nown research area that to me would be \nreally \nreally amazing and then you you really \nneed to figure out a metric for ranking \nthe quality of those abstractions \nand that to me that that's a lot of the \ntime what we \num always circle back to is how do you \nrank it's the relevancy like how do you \nhow do we judge a good search result and \nhow do you in this situation how would \nyou judge a good kind of abstractive \nsummary um of like 20 papers you know so \nyou'd and you just you do that based off \nof \num \nwhen you're developing a product you can \ndo that based off of like input signals \nlike uh whether it's a like button or \nthat they they cited it or whatever so \nyou just you you learn from these \nsignals what's working \nis that does that answer your question a \nbit yeah yeah and um i think i'm one of \nthe biggest fans of the research from uh \nthe allen institute with uh like what \nlucy wang and um sorry and kyle lowe \npublished two of two researchers that i \nfollow closely like from on twitter and \nseeing all the things they do with the \nallen institute and semantics scholar is \nthey've done such a good job of breaking \ndown all these tasks like you mentioned \nlike um like classifying what they call \nsite tenses like citation sentences so \nyou classify it of the intent so so yeah \nit's like again there's there's like \nabstractive summary pretty ambitious \nfirst step it might be better to first \njust like have models that classify like \nwas this experiment set up correctly \nuh do they properly \n[Music] \nyou know communicate the background so \nyeah i definitely it definitely won't be \njust right to the reviews \nand there'll be all sorts of subtests \nthat's an interesting way of thinking \nabout it because i think uh in terms of \njust actual like structure structural \nlooking for structural appropriateness \nof a product of a project because \nthere's there's been some really cool \noutput just in terms of language models \nthat you know they look at like document \nstructure um rather than like the text \nitself and i think that's a that's a \nreally nice point in terms of \num you know you could even just \nidentifying that a cert like a certain \npaper doesn't fit like the criteria of a \ncertain structure like oh you can kind \nof make an inference that maybe it's not \nof high quality if you know they haven't \nintroduced uh the the domain problem \ncorrectly \nor you know that the the citations \naren't properly done or that it doesn't \neven have a conclusion you know just \nbeing able to detect stuff there's a lot \nof you know the there's a lot of really \ngood publications out there but there's \nit's a lot easier to publish nowadays \nwithout any peer review and then the \nquality of those papers can be \num fairly variable so being able to \nassess like high quality papers through \nalgorithms like that and kind of large \nlanguage ones that would be very very \npowerful like being able to kind of put \na certificate just being able to tag a \npaper being like \nof kind of a certain \nstructural quality \nyes so interesting and um yeah like so \nwe're talking about like um scientific \nliterature mining review platforms like \ngoogle scholar is i think the famous one \nthat everyone uses to build up their \nmaster's thesis and you know semantic \nscholar as i talk about the allen \ninstitute i think in my opinion they've \nimpressed me the most with the research \noutput and almost really leading the \ntopic i'd say but um so what do you \nthink about papers with code are you \nfamiliar with that and how they organize \nit how do you contrast that with genius \nand think about like generally your \nstance on what they're building \nyeah papers where code is \nreally you know \nwe i've i look at them a lot in terms of \nlike \npresentation of the information they are \nyou know a lot of what we do is \num it just goes down to that ux end of \nthings where you actually just try and \nfind a really nice clean way of \npresenting the information and you try \nand you try not to overload the the user \ntoo much \nand i think sometimes when we're dealing \nwith these like kind of high concept ai \nproducts that element gets overlooked \nand i think it's really crucial you know \nthat's that's probably the part that we \nthink about and change up the most which \nis like how good is this ux so the \npapers were code is \nreally really good for that um and i \ni've always enjoyed going i always \nwhenever i go on to papers report i've \nalways enjoyed just just the interface \nand like navigation across the site is \nreally really good \num i suppose with us because we we \nactually extend beyond just scientific \nliterature like we we actually can we \ncan do like science and sorry like \nliterature the arts the humanities \nhistory business so for us \nyou know \nwe kind of we have to keep on with some \nmore of a generic like way of presenting \nour papers and and our publications \nbecause it can cover any field so papers \nof code kind of has the benefit of you \nknow \nit's papers with code so it it these \nthese things have a kind of you have a \npaper and you have a data set and then \nyour code presentation typically so we \nhave to abstract that down a little bit \nmore just to kind of a paper structure \nthat being said our data set does \nactually include links to code \nto code so \nit would absolutely be something we \ncould look into in the future when with \na bit more um time and manpower you know \nwhere a small team at right now \num but yeah what \njust to go back to it papers something \nlike papers or code \nthey are a shiny example of good design \nand like how good design when search \nlike go hand in hand like search search \nengine search recommendation systems \nlike it's like a 50 50 split between the \nquality of the recommendations and \nsearch results and the the interface \nfor interacting with those results and \nthat that relationship is super \nimportant \nyeah yeah super and i i love the um the \ntext editor build in i think that is \nhuge i read a paper from some google ai \nresearchers called wordcraft and it \ndocuments how they're using like a chat \nbot to help people write things and i \nthink that integration of the text \neditor is is a really cool thing that's \nin kenya that i haven't seen anything \nelse that uh does it that well and i and \ni love the plug-in with google docs i \nthink that's a really nice uh transition \nfor people so anyway so we've covered so \nmany topics and thank you so much \ncharles i you know i think this was \ndefinitely one of the most informative \npodcasts and you know it was it was a \nlot of fun to do this so thank you so \nmuch \nthank you very much this was a hell of a \nlot of fun i really really enjoyed it \nand thank you very much \nfor for having me on i really appreciate \nit \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Podcast #2: How Keenious uses Weaviate to enable semantic search through 60M+ academic PUBs", "path": "", "link":
