{"text": "See how to authenticate against Weaviate using various authentication options. See what difference (if any) it might have on ... \nhi there in this short video we'll \ndiscuss authentication from the \nclient-side perspective \nwe'll show you how you can access \nwebiate with various authentication \nsetups \nto do this we'll use the python client \nwith vva instances from vv8 cloud \nservices which is also called WCS \nbut please note that the principles are \nthe same for other clients and we get \ninstances running in other ways such as \nwith Docker or kubernetes \nlet's get started first let's take a \nlook at WCS instances that we'll be \nusing \nokay here we are at my WCS dashboard you \ncan see that I've got three wavy8 \ninstances here one of which is a \nstandard cluster and the other two being \nsandbox instances \nWCS clusters come with different \nauthentication options depending on the \ntype \nso let's click on the details button \nhere to see cluster details \nyou see a lot of useful information here \nincluding the URL and the webiate \nversion \nwhat we want is the authentication \ninformation and we can get that by \nclicking on this button here \nthat'll show the API Keys now we'll be \nusing these to log in later \nyou'll notice I have hidden mind here \nand that's because you should treat \nthese API Keys like your passwords as \nthey can be used to provide access to \nthe corresponding vv8 cluster \nnote that this cluster provides two keys \nadmin and read only you can probably \nguess how they're different but we'll \nalso show you later on \non the other hand this sandbox instant \nis is set up to not require \nauthentication this is obviously not \nsecure and it's only available for \nsandboxed instances as an option for \neasy experimentation \nlastly let's look at the other sandbox \ninstance this one is set up with \nauthentication this is the default \noption when you create the sandbox and \nif we look at the API Keys you'll notice \nthat it only includes an admin key as \nthe read-only key is only provided on \nproduction clusters \nnow that we have the authentication \ninformation let's see how we can use \nthese with a waviate client to interact \nwith a waviate server okay I've got a \nJupiter notebook here to demonstrate \nconnecting to two of the Wii V8 servers \nyou saw earlier using various \nauthentication methods we'll use the \npublic sandbox and the production \ninstance that requires authentication \nwe'll Define the URLs here like so \nand let's start with the anonymous \naccess \nthe public instance requires no user \ncredentials so all we need to access it \nis the URL which we defined earlier and \nthe client should be ready to go \ngreat \nnow what happens if we try the same \nthing on a non-public instance \nyou can see the client throws an error \nas it's not able to access the server \nand if we look through the error message \nwe see that it's due to lack of login \ncredentials \nso let's take a look at how we can \nprovide these credentials \nwe'll create multiple instances of the \nclient here so we can compare them at \nthe end \nthe first option we'll look at is using \nthe API key \nwhen we're passing login credentials we \nneed to pass an additional argument \nthrough the auth client secret parameter \nfor the API key you should use the auth \nAPI key class as shown here \nand the key specified as a string \nhere I've got it saved as an environment \nvariable but you can pass it in any way \ngenerally it's more secure to have your \nscript read keys or passwords like this \nor from a file so that they're not \nexposed in scripts or notebooks that \nmight be shared \nand now we're able to access the \ninstance unlike before where there was \nan exception \nlet's try the same with username and \npassword \nthis uses a standard protocol called \noidc or open ID connect which is a \nlittle more complex under the hood \nIE instances and WCS are configured to \nauthenticate users based on their WCS \ncredentials so you can just pass them on \nlike so \nnotice here that I'm using a different \nclass called auth client password and \npassing on my WCS username and password \nthese credentials could be used for any \nof my WCS instances whereas each API key \nwill be unique to that particular web \ninstance only \nand lastly let's instantiate a client \nusing a read-only key you saw earlier \nthat production instances come with a \nread-only key so that's the key that I'm \nusing in this example you can see that \njust as before the client is ready to go \nlet's test them out to see if they all \nwork as they should we'll begin with a \nsimple query we'll set up a dictionary \nof the client instances that we've \ndefined flu can Loop through them \nand here we'll just go through the loop \nto retrieve one object with each client \ninstance \nand you can see that each one is able to \nretrieve data from waviate now we'll try \nwriting to aviate using the same process \nhere I've got a helper function defined \nso we can create a class and just \nconfirm that it's been added \nwe delete it again once I've confirmed \nthat it's been successfully added \nwe'll run this function in the loop here \nI've also set it up to catch any \nexceptions that might get thrown and \nwhen we run the cell we see that it \nworks for three out of the four \ninstances that we've built but one of \nthem throws an exception \npredictably it's the read-on decline \nthat's drawn the exception because as \nthe name suggests it's not allowed to \nmake modifications to aviate server \nthat's it for our demo showing you how \nto log into or authenticate against \nwebiate with the python client \nas you saw it's important that you use \nthe correct authentication configuration \nto match how the server is set up and by \nusing the right configuration classes \nand keep in mind that different \nidentities can have different levels of \nauthorization or permissions so make \nsure to authenticate with the \nappropriate credentials for more \ninformation you can also take a look at \nour documentation to see I can use \ndifferent clients for authentication or \nto learn how to create instances on WCS \nthanks for watching see you next time \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Authentication: A client-side perspective", "path": "", "link":
