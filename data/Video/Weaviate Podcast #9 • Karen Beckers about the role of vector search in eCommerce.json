{"text": "Karen Beckers, Data Scientist from Squadra Machine Learning Company, gives insightful information about how to use vector ... \n[Music] \nthank you so much for checking out the \neighth episode of the we va podcast \ntoday i'm joined with karen beckers a \ndata scientist at squadron machine \nlearning company karen thank you so much \nfor coming on the podcast can you tell \nus about how you're using the we vv8 \nvector search engine \nyeah thank you for having me i'm really \nexcited \nas you said i'm a data scientist it's \nquite a machine learning company \nand we're a company that provides \ncustomers with ai and data science \nsolutions on one hand we have our own \nproducts \num and we focus on \nsuppliers wholesalers and retail \nand with those products we provide \nsolutions for smart product data \nmanagement \nsupply chain optimization and as we like \nto call it ai commerce instead of \ne-commerce but on the other hand \nwe do projects \nand these projects we provide data \nscience solutions \nfor any specific \ntask that a customer might have so and \nthis is actually where viviate comes in \nbecause for one of our customers an \ne-commerce customer we're building a \nsearch engine \nand we're doing this a little bit \ndifferent than the \nmore \ntraditional methods of search so \nactually um \nbuilding the search engine based on the \nimage relevance \nso we started out with the proof of \nconcept of only a thousand products \nuh just to see if it was actually \npossible can we \nget relevant results \num \nresults are relevant to the query based \non the images \nand at that point we were just brute \nforcing it so we were just we calculated \nthe vectors which is brute forcing \nthe the vector similarity \nand of course that doesn't scale if \nyou're going to larger data set so we \nhad to transfer uh transform to a \ndifferent platform \nand um so that's when we we stumbled \nupon wev8 and um \nsince then it's it's been so much easier \nthe whole process has been so much \neasier and yeah it's really it's really \ngreat to be to use with yet \nyeah i think that that idea of using an \nimage to search for products is so \ninteresting and i've seen uh demos of \nsay like the fashion mnist data set to \ngive kind of like a illustration of what \nthis looks like where you say take a bag \nand then hit the data set of bags to \nfind the most similar looking bag \nwhat so what kind of data sets are you \nusing to kind of uh bring that to the \nreal world to say like maybe pinterest \nhave an api or like how do you get the \ndata set of real world uh these \necommerce kind of pictures \num so the the data that our customer \nuses he um they they scrape the \ndata from \nfrom brands that they they are selling \nand we're using a \nzero shot model that is actually able to \nmap \ntextual texts and images to the same \nvector space \num \nand for search that actually works \nworked well and we're also using it for \nclassification \num \nbut for classification you can do some \nlike after the vectorization you could \ndo a linear probe to \nyou know match the \nthe vector a bit more a bit better to \nthe categories \nthat sounds so interesting like that \npipeline of um so for so you could have \nan image image search a text to image \nsearch and then you can also append a \nclassifier with the high level discrete \nvariables of \nbag shoe or maybe brands like nike \nadidas or \nthat kind of thing so what kind of um so \nwith the text to image search and the \nimage to image search what kind of are \nthe two different things that go into \neach of those things \num \nso for \nthe thing if you use text to image then \num \nyou can also expand that to text to text \nand then combine those \nand the difference with image to image \nis that you only have that image and \num \n[Music] \nso we're using the model that i just \nmentioned that maps text to the same \nvector space as images but we're also \nusing only text models \num \nso if you if you do text to image then \nyou can use both but if you do image \nimage then you only have that image \nmodel so you only can make use of the \ninformation that is stored in the image \num \nwhich is also a challenge but that's \ninteresting of course \nyeah it's so interesting you can also uh \nlike label it with like you know the \nsymbolic metadata that describes the \nimages as well to have that kind of \nmaybe sanity checking for the image \nimage search i'm curious about how you \nevaluate the um do you annotate say like \nthe top k and you have annotations of \nthe best nearest neighbor for images or \nhow do you kind of evaluate an image \nsearch system at scale \nyeah that's that's difficult um because \nwe don't have a golden standard of \nlike a set of queries that we we know \nthat these products have to come up in \nthe top 10 results we don't have that so \nthat's difficult \num \nbut we're now using a \ntool called cupid \nwhere you um \nwhere you can they the tool lists your \ntop 10 results and you can \nannotate them yourself with either \nbinary battery uh \nmeasurements or on a scale \nand then as you update your algorithm \nand different results come come up then \nthat automatically updates as well so \nyou at least have a quantitative idea of \nhow good the results are \nyeah that's so interesting \nthe um \nso cupid is a labeling software is that \ncorrect i'm really curious about these \nkinds of things and uh can you tell me a \nlittle bit more about what cupid does \nyeah i'm actually just getting into \ncupid myself \nwe started on that uh i think two weeks \nago \nso that's all that's very new \nbut um \nit's not not in that sense a labeling \nsoftware it's \num \nit's maybe more relevancy tool \nfor any search engine so it's actually \num \n[Music] \nit's pre-built for solar or \nelasticsearch \num but we just \num \nrewrote our our weavit output so that it \nlooks like elastic output so that the \ntool can actually interpret that \num \nbut i think just for any search engine \nyou need \na tool to um \nto score your results to say okay how \nhow well is my my system actually doing \nand cupid is just one of those tools \nthat that can help you with that \nyeah thanks so much for that i i love \nfollowing along with these labeling \nsoftwares and i see like the big name \nthings like say um scale ai and snorkel \nai the things that i think most people \nare aware of but also been looking into \nthings like rubrics and learning more \nabout these tools i think it's such an \ninteresting uh \npart of this so the next question that i \nlove to ask on the web podcast and i \nthink especially for image to image and \ntext to image search is such an \ninteresting different angle is usually \nwe're talking about text to text search \nwhere we have all these say sentence \ntransformers and the hugging face model \nhub i'd say is you know mostly geared \ntowards natural language processing but \nso how well does say using a resnet 50 \ntrained on imagenet uh just right off \nthe shelf taking those pre-trained \nembeddings and then using that to image \nto do image to image search in the \ntransferring domain from you know the \nthousand or so classes in imagenet into \ne-commerce how's that off-the-shelf \ntransition from pre-trained model into \napplication \num \nthat's a good question \num \nyeah so \nthe the model that we're using it's not \nnot the pre-trained resonant or it is \num one of the versions actually resonant \nbased \num \nbut this one is it's just trained on the \nbasically what they say is like whole \nwikipedia whole internet \num with the images and the labels the \nmetadata labels that are with the images \num \nso \nthat \ngives you a whole like a very broad \nbroad scale of what what the the model \nactually knows so that's that's really \ngreat \nbut um \nfor a really funny example actually what \nwe saw that the \nmodel was trained up until \ni think \nmaybe 2019 so \npre-covered \nand so it doesn't recognize face masks \nso that's actually very funny \nbut of course now face mask you can't \nyou see them everywhere there's such a \nnormal \nnormal view on the street and the model \njust doesn't know those so that's that's \ndifficult \nwow that's such an interesting part of \nthe um the updating information and \nthat's one of my favorite things about \ndecomposing deep learning tasks into \nretrieve and then read because uh when \nyou separate it into a separate \nretrieval task you can easily update the \ninformation compared to having one \nrunning supervised learning model and \nyou just try to like update the \ninformation by doing further gradient \nupdates with some uh new data set but i \nlove how you could just \njust you know drop in a new retrieval \ndata set with the face mask to have that \nadaptation \nand yeah i think that's such an \ninteresting part so it so is this the \nopen ai clip model that you're using \nyeah and yeah exactly \nyeah i really like this paper it's uh \nthey use this weight space ensembling \ntechnique where they go from the uh from \nthe zero shot generalization of clip \ntrain on all of the internet and then \nthey fine tune it on particular data \nsets and these are like academic \nbenchmarks it's not like quite like uh \ne-commerce product matching but they \nshow that if you do that weight space \nensembling along the path from the \npre-trained clip checkpoint into the \nfine-tuned representation \nthen you get like the both the zero shot \nflexibility as well as that like in \ndistribution \nfine-tune things so do you have uh like \nparticular ways of evaluating that that \nidea of the out-of-district like the how \nyou would say how flexible it is how \nrobust it is compared to the evaluation \non the fine-tuned data set \num no that's actually \nvery difficult \nright now \nbecause we we don't have we haven't \nfine-tuned clip ourselves \nmainly because we don't have a large \nenough data set that's actually labeled \nthat was also \num \nthe challenge that brought this customer \nto us their data isn't labeled \num \nand \nwe had a we had a a blog on medium \nactually about image classification uh \nso that's how they came uh came to us \num \n[Music] \nso that was already a challenge for us \nokay we we can do image classification \nbut it's difficult if we don't have any \nlabeled data so that's why we we turned \nthe clip and then that that \nthat actually turned out to to work \nreally well \num \nand we're all we're also yeah we're \nconstantly thinking um \nabout how can we how can we improve back \nwhen we we fine-tune the model but if we \ndon't have any any labeled data then \nthat's really difficult so \nyeah i see the um like the idea of using \ntransfer learning to label data for some \nother domain or say um \nyeah like this idea of maybe you might \ncall it programmatic labeling where you \nhave the pre-trained model that you're \nnow using to label data it kind of \nreminds me of say like semi-supervised \nlearning as well yeah you know propagate \nit and go label the unlabeled data and \nyeah this is one of the things like uh \ncoming back to these say like uh open \nsource labeling software tools the \nrubrics framework has a great interface \nfor \nuh this this idea that we're describing \nif you use the clip model to label your \nunlabeled data set and i think that's \nsuch an interesting topic with like \nbootstrapping unlabeled data sets and \nthen maybe pushing those to say like the \nhugging face data sets or something \nwhere people can collectively use them \nand build on them \nwhat kind of a vision and language data \nsets like inspire you to work on them \nmaybe like visual question answering or \nvisual common sense reasoning i see \nmaybe like a lot of vision based \nrobotics where the labeling is uh like \nfollow instructions through some kind of \nthing something like that what kind of \nvision and language data sets interest \nyou the most \num \num i have to say like except for \nwe're not doing a lot of vision \nvision projects right now so we're \nmainly using using clip for that we we \ndo use a lot of language models \num \nthere was this project um where we \ntrained the team the google \nt5 model \nand we we use it to train a paraphraser \num \nand we have we've been using a \nbird \nscentsy bird uh \num \n[Music] \nso um \ni think yeah maybe those are maybe the \nmore standard models but um \ni think right now the model that that \nhas the most promise um that has been \nproven to be the most promising for a \nlot of projects that we're we're working \non is probably sentence bird \nyeah sentence bird is so cool i love \nthese like the siamese architecture of \nthe decomposition of bird into just \nsomething that's \nintentionally producing embedding so \nso the um yeah the text description so \nwriting some kind of description that \ndescribes the product is that kind of \nit's an interesting thing to me is \nwhether you want to take like an image \nof the shoe that you've seen on on maybe \nyou're watching a tic toc video and you \nsee a shoe that you like and you want to \njust take a picture of it and use that \nto index \nlike amazon or \nor whatever to get the product but \ncompared to writing a language \ndescription of the thing you're looking \nfor do you think the \nthe language description is maybe a more \nuh \nsay like robust path for search than \nimage based search \nnot sure actually because \nyou know \nas they always say like a picture says \nmore than a thousand words \ni think that probably \nuh \ni think that probably \nis true for this as well right um you \ncan \nyou always describe the the image or the \nproduct \num from your own imagination and if that \ndoesn't really match \num \nor is just differently nuanced from \num \nhow it's represented in vector space \nthen that um \nthat could could be problematic and \nmaybe maybe an actual image is more \nrobust \nand you could you could probably do both \nas well right like have the um you send \nthe image and then maybe it's like just \ninspiration and you're trying to \nlike um i like this sneaker but maybe \nsomething that's more so \ni don't know what kind of textual \ndescription would expand on this \nparticular sneaker but the combination \nof language and text to search for \nsomething how would that kind of thing \nwork \nyeah that's really interesting i thought \num i read an article \na while back they're saying that google \nis actually working on that right now \nthat you can upload an image and \nuse a textual description \num i'm really interested to see how that \nhow that would work \num \ni don't have any experience with that \num i am i imagine \nyeah i \nmaybe you can combine the vectors in \nsome way \nsay if you if you would would map the \nvectors to the same vector space \nand maybe \nyou can calculate an average of the two \nvectors combined that has the \nthat both information \nthe information of both both entities \ncombined \ni'm very interested to see how that \nwould work \nyeah i love that idea and like also \nmaybe combining it with like the \nsymbolic annotation which i want to ask \nabout next but uh yeah i love the google \nsay the landmark detection competition \nthey host on kaggle i think they host \nthat every year where \nyou have an image of say eiffel tower \nand then you index their database to \nfind the other image of the eiffel tower \nand i think this is one of the most uh \nlong running nearest neighbor open \nsource competitions on kaggle and you \nhad such an interesting idea of adding \non the text to further enhance that like \nimage image text image kind of search \nthing so i want to talk about symbolic \nfilters and like symbolic search seems \nto be basically solved where if you have \nthe \nyou know symbolic annotation on the \nproducts and the query you can just \nexactly match them and say they're \nexactly matched \nso could you extract the symbolic \nfilters um from the text description so \npeople don't have to be \nuh like entering their schema and have \nthis kind of fixed schema whereas they \ncan just write natural language \ndescriptions and then from there you can \ncreate a symbolic kind of tagging from \nit \nyeah we we do um we do that in in some \nsense um where we have \none of the products actually that we we \nhave at the machine learning company \nis a feature extraction tool where you \ncan upload a product description \nand then \nyou also upload \nyour your data model so you you know \nthe the whole taxonomy you know what \nfeatures there are and what the possible \nvalues are and then the algorithm \nextracts um those features from from the \ntext \num \nso we're also doing that for this \ncustomer as well and we're trying to \nenhance it with \nimage feature extraction \nso um where we accept for example color \nuh you have a list of colors and then \nyou can say okay what color matches this \nuh product best \nthat's super cool that because that kind \nof adds like the symbolic filtering of \nsay regular expression matching in text \nto images where you can you know find \nthe color exactly by using the um by \nhaving just the pixel that appears in \nthe thing uh can you so can you tell me \na little more about yeah this mapping \nfrom like unstructured data like \nyeah images or just a language \ndescription you describe your product \nwith into structured data where you have \nthat data schema you have that kind of \npredefined model of what your data looks \nlike how does that mapping from \nunstructured to structured data look \num \nso on text based we we mainly use \nregular expressions \nbut \n[Music] \nof course \nyou can also provide a list of synonyms \nand then you have a really elaborate \nsystem that can um extract those those \nelements from the text but then of \ncourse there's also the possibility when \nthey're the the product is actually red \nshoes but then the description says you \ncan also pair this really well with your \nblue jeans so then extract red and blue \nand for that we actually \nagain use some vector representation to \ndetermine which color is actually best \nfitted to the product so use the context \nof the whole text to determine which \nvalue is actually true \nyeah i love that dimension of adding \nsymbolic filters even within the same \ndata domain so so for like searching for \nimages if you search not just for say \nanother shoe but like then a whole \noutfit to be returned and you add the \nsymbolic filter on to what's being \nreturned and this is kind of like one of \nthe more technical details in wv8 that i \nreally like talking about is the um like \nthe pre-filtering step on h sw where \nthey actually cook these symbolic \nfilters into this massive vector index \nthat can do something like search for \nthrough 100 million vectors of pictures \nof shoes and e-commerce products i think \nit's so interesting though uh so on that \nalso though coming back to symbolic and \nstructured data and we talked about \nfusing embedding spaces of image \nrepresentations and language \nrepresentations could we form say using \ntechniques like contrastive learning or \nmaybe mass auto encoders representations \nof the structured data as well and then \nhave that further embedding space \nalignment between images language and \nthen the structured data as well through \nsome deep learning technique to encode \nthe structured data \nthat's a very interesting idea \num \n[Music] \ni think if if we can that would of \ncourse be very helpful because \nwith the symbolic data you're almost \nall \nrestricted to to keywords or \na list of synonyms and that's never \ncomplete so if we can actually \nuh have some kind of embedding space \nthat incorporates everything \num that would that would be awesome of \ncourse \nyeah yeah i think like the multimodal \nlearning the ability to combine all \nthese different kinds of data i i think \nthat's what's driving like what's on the \nfrontier of what will drive so much \nprogress in this technology kind of so \nwith these advances in deep learning for \nsearch and e-commerce can you maybe tell \nme some things that uh \nnot to name any particular e-commerce \nplatforms but some of the things that \nare missing that really need to be added \nor on the like the front the cutting \nedge of like uh new features in \ne-commerce \num \n[Music] \nwith with deep learning well actually i \nthink \num \nmaybe what we're doing and what we're \ntrying to do right now and retrieving \nproducts based on the images um \ni think that would help a lot if that uh \nof course it's still an ongoing process \nand it's very difficult to to tune it \ntune it well and and get the proper \nresults because sometimes you do need \ntextual \nfields to get the actual good results \nbut if if we can um \nalready establish a baseline based on \nthe images that i think a lot of uh \ne-commerce platforms \nuh could benefit from that that \nif their suppliers uh provide the data \nthen of course there's always noise in \nthat \nand supplier maybe some suppliers they \ndon't provide the data in the correct \nformat and so if we can enhance that \nwith the images or some some automated \nuh \nin an automated fashion then that would \nreally be a helpful thing \nyeah i love the idea of say when you see \nsome funny thing at home goods and you \ntake a picture of it and then it indexes \nlike etsy ebay amazon and you have this \nwhole like um \nthat idea of going from an image into \nthe whole catalog of all the things on \nthe internet i think is like such an \ninteresting topic with things that might \nbe on the frontier and like new ideas in \ne-commerce so so i wanted to ask you \nabout what you think about kind of open \nsource generally and the idea of say \nproviding demonstrations of what your \ntechnology can do on say hugging face \nspaces and how there are these easier \ninterfaces to build and share user \ninterfaces with tools like say \ngradio or streamlit as well as kind of \nthe general topic around say \nopen sourcing data sets and publishing \npapers \num \ni'm actually not familiar with with \ngradio streamlit but in general \nopen source datasets and openness models \nand the whole open source community i \nthink it's it's it's actually for us \nit's great because a lot of times we get \ncustomers that like they're not \nuh \ntheir company isn't that large so they \ndon't have \nthat that a great amount of data \nand the data is often not not structured \nwell or it's it's really noisy \nso that is always difficult \nyou know that there is an ai solution \nthat will work for them but if you don't \nhave the data to train that model \nyourself then that's very difficult so \num using those open source models and \nbeing able to to \nbase \nlike have a foundation based on those \nand then being able to fine-tune it with \nthe the smaller set of data that you do \nhave that that is really helpful \nyeah that like collection of pre-trained \nmodels and like coming back to the \npre-trained uh siamese bur sentence bert \ni'm not sure what the s stands for in \nesper i think it might be sentence for \nbut yeah \nbut but yeah like the the boom in the \npre-trained architectures it enables \nsuch a like starting point and also like \nkind of in taking down the cost of \ntraining these models because you have \nthe pre-trained checkpoint so you don't \nneed even with your smaller data set \ngenerally you don't need to \nuh tune it for as long do you see the \ncost as being one of the other like big \nselling points of these pre-trained \nmodels \nyeah exactly could we uh if you would \nfor example gt2 or even gp3 that's not \neven realistic to train it yourself with \nwith \nthe data and the the cost \nwe can we can have \num so yeah if we if we don't have to do \nthat ourselves and that that's \nthat's really helpful that's that's \ngreat \nwe can we can't use that we can't \nmimic that ourselves as a as a smaller \nsmaller company not not one of the the \nlarge larger tech companies in the in \nthe us of course \nyeah the cost of it is such an \ninteresting part of deep learning \nbecause it's \nyeah to push the cutting edge of it you \nneed to really have expensive computers \nand you know distributed computers and \nall the \npretty interesting stuff have any recent \ntrends and kind of efficiency gains in \ndeep learning been interesting to you \num \nyeah \num \nthere comes one model to mine i actually \nforgot its name \num \nyeah let me think about it i thought it \nwas really really interesting because of \ncourse with all the bigger models that \nare out there right now um \nthere's a lot more computational cost a \nlot of more \nin that sense electricity use and all \nthe data centers that are constantly \nrunning and \num \nyeah we're trying to be a little bit \nmore environmentally friendly but data \nscience isn't really and so i read about \nthis this model that um \nthat uses a lot less capacity um that is \nactually \num \ni thought it was was a multitask some \nmultitask model but it would only um \nactivate those \nneurons that i would actually use and \nthen and that way it it \nuse a lot less computational uh \npower \ni'm yeah i forgot the name about it but \ni thought that was very very interesting \nif we could \num \nfrom a data science \nperspective be a little bit more \nenvironmentally friendly as well \nyeah i think you're talking about the um \nthe lottery ticket hypothesis and the in \nthe masks that they put on the \non the network and it shows that you \nonly need to say the sparse sub network \nto \nuh achieve the same performance as the \nfull dense network \nand yes i think as cool as that sparse \nmasking idea is i think they still have \nsome like hardware optimizations before \nyou can really completely realize the \nefficiency gains of applying the masking \nonto the dense architecture because i \nthink right now you're still doing the \nsame computation you just add the mass \nto it no okay \nso i think there's still uh some \ninteresting things to be developed in \nthat kind of idea so \nkind of more broadly with like um data \nscience and then like we v8 vector \nsearch and i think it's really \ninteresting maybe this transition and \ndatabase technology from sql relational \ndatabases into nosql the flexibility of \njson kind of data the way that it lets \nyou just adaptively update your schema \nand now into wev8 where we have the \nflexibility of nosql but plus this deep \nlearning functionality what do you think \nabout this kind of trend in this tooling \nfor data scientists \nuh yeah i think it's really helpful uh \nespecially since we're \ngenerally in data science we're moving a \nlot more towards \nusing vectors than than any other \ntype of data \nso having the infrastructure to actually \nuse that and make because the \ni think the previous \ngeneration of databases \nthey're they're they're very they're \nreally well established and you they're \nthey're great to use \num so \ngoing into that new area of vectors \nis they may be a bit more tricky in the \ndatabase sense so using a tool like like \nwe've a way \nwhere you can actually \nuh have a solid base um \nfor your data then that that's that's \nreally great \nmove \nforward yeah i think there's a lot of \ninteresting topics with um how data \nscientists will use vector search \nfunctionality and as particularly as \nwe've been talking about the idea of \nusing unstructured data more so where \nyou just have \nimages or just freeform language \ndescriptions of whatever data you're \ntrying to describe maybe and then you \ncould go into all sorts of things like \naudio video biological data graph \nstructured road networks all these like \nunstructured kind of data sources that \nyou can use now for \nstandard kind of data science do you \nthink the downstream functionality as we \nsay describe like nearest neighbor \nsearch as retrieve and then read being \nyou take the retrieval part and then use \nthat as input to some kind of supervised \nlearning model do you think supervised \nlearning models will become a more \ncommon tool for data scientists i know \nwe maybe do things like regression \nanalysis and look at the coefficients of \nregressions and do the correlations do \nyou think maybe things like say \nretrieving from your data and then using \na text-to-image model to \ngenerate some kind of say visualization \nof your data or any kind of these \ncreative supervised learning \napplications do you think that will \nbecome more popular with say \njust like the average data scientist who \nisn't necessarily like a machine \nlearning research scientist \num \nwould you maybe rephrase that i'm not \nsure i understood it \nyeah like um the idea of labeling pairs \nof data for like labeling x y pairs and \ntrying to bootstrap some \nsome kind of task \ndo you think that's something that could \nbecome more common with like a typical \nday in the life of a data scientist or \nin comparison to maybe say um \nusing mostly say like descriptive \nstatistics looking for \nlike statistics in the distributions of \ndata and the kind of say traditional \nsort of \nproducing charts and that kind of \nobjective of data science \noh in that sense yeah i do think uh that \nwill become more um \n[Music] \nwe will see that a lot more \nbecause i also think that um the models \nthat are out there and the tooling that \nis out there to use the models is \num \nhow do you say it's more accessible than \nit was before \nso not only for actual data scientists \nbut also for people \num they're not really data scientists \nbut they're more accessible to use um \ni actually had a header id once that \nmaybe in the future there will be like a \nplug-in in in excel where you you load \nyour data and you just you push a button \nin excel and say okay they're now now \ntraining gradient descent \ntraining simple regression model or even \nan ensemble \nmethod um that and then maybe not even \npeople who know about the data science \ncan use those those methods \noh i love that idea even people who \ndon't even know about data science like \nyou could just have a natural language \nvery fuzzy description of what you're \ntrying to do with your data and and it \ncould interpret that and map it into a \nfunction \ni've seen um hugging face added to \ngoogle sheets and yeah that kind of \nintegration i think is so interesting of \nadding deep learning functionality into \nsay just like excel spreadsheets but \nthen also as we talked about integrating \nthe unstructured data as well which i \nthink is such an interesting part of of \nthe weevie because with wva you can \nstill have your structured csvs if you \nwant to look through that and have that \nkind of json data but then you can also \nadd \nimages and \nlanguage and things that are \nmore uncommon to this so so with your \nuse of uh we v8 how has that been do you \nhave any things that like you know maybe \nyou wish were added to ev8 \num well \nthere were actually already a couple of \nthings that um when we started out with \nwev8 i think it was the end of november \num \nsome functionalities that we really \nneeded weren't there yet so \nfor example the the openai click model \nthat we were using they um didn't have \nit \nout of the box in in we've yet yet so we \nof course we could import our own \nvectors and then use a new vector search \nwith that \num but then the downside is that for \nevery query we would have to vectorize \nthe query ourselves so send an api \nrequest to our api send it back and all \nthe latency issues that come with that \num so that um they already that the clip \nmodel is actually integrated in with it \nright now so that's already great that \nthat's really helpful \num \nbut also what we're i've heard that \nthey're that they're not currently \nworking on the beam 25 integra \nimplementation so we're really looking \nforward to that because \nas you said we we can use the symbolic \ndata to filter \num \nbut \nthen the integration of doing actual \nkeyword search retrieving results based \non keyword search and then combining \nthat with the image results \nis currently very difficult because \nthere's no score coming from the keyword \nsearch and um \nthere is a score from the image search \nbut then how how you have to combine it \nin some way how they're doing that if \nyou don't have scores for both so we're \nreally looking forward to that to that \nimplementation \nbut i've heard they're working on it \nright now so \nyeah that's so interesting and uh kind \nof the first thing you said the the \nmodularity of the different vectorizers \nor the different embedding models how \nyou have the open ai embedding model in \nembedding models like clip or say the um \nthe latest cpc code cpc text and how you \ncan put the model into eva so you don't \nneed to have two separate apis and then \ni love this idea of the combination of \ndifferent retrieval models in the same \napi so you can have the bm25 and you can \nhave your dense esper representation all \nin that same api and then you start \ngetting into this really interesting \ntopic of how do we interpret this kind \nof fuzzy distance and combine the \noutputs of tfidf bm25 these lexical \nsparse retrievals with dense \nesberg how how are we supposed to fuse \nthe outputs of them \ndo you have any further ideas on this \nmaybe say like um coming back to the \nlabeling software maybe we could use \nlabeling software to start annotating \nthe uh the different scores that come \nout of our model and then have like \nanother neural layer on top of that that \nuh interprets the outputs from say five \ndifferent retrievals where it could be \nuh tf idf bm25 and then say three \ndifferent variations of training your \nesber model because the the ways that \nyou fine tune it right could lead to \ndifferent behavior too many ideas on i \nlike how we can combine those outputs \nyeah that's actually \nvery difficult and we we've been stuck \non that for quite a while now um \nbut it's very interesting what you're \nsaying we also have that idea that we \nhave all these different components so \nwe have \nthe image image results but we're also \ndoing a \ntext similarity on the product names and \nwe can do text similarity on ever any \nother field that we have but then also \ndo the keyword search \nand then all those different components \nhow are we going to combine those and we \nactually had an idea of training maybe \njust a very simple random forest and use \nthose weights \num actually \nthe or the \nthe the feature importances of that \nmodel uh to use as weights for for all \nthe different components \num \nbut uh \nright now we don't have a fixed solution \nyet so if you haven't have any then \nideas always welcome because it's a very \ndifficult topic and it's still ongoing \nand it will probably be ongoing for a \nwhile i don't think it will be solved \nvery soon \nyeah i've discussed this with some uh of \nthe we vva team and we love this maybe \ncalling this human computer interaction \nthis idea of how we interpret these \nfuzzy distances from neural searches \ncompared to as bob describes the binary \noutput of when you search for something \nin a traditional search engine it either \ncontains it or it doesn't compare to \nthis where it's like this is 80 similar \nto what you said and you're like okay so \nwhat do i make of this and i i love what \nyou said with the random forest layer i \nthink maybe in my studying of deep \nlearning i become like overfit to this \nidea of putting a neural network onto \neverything but \nwhen you just have these uh you know \nfive different outputs you could \nprobably just use a simpler \nlike uh just a random force or uh \nlike really like um \nnot not using a neural network \nimmediately because um \nthe well the whole the whole field of ai \nwhere \nespecially the past couple of years \neveryone's really focused on neural \nneural techniques \nbut um \nit's easy to forget the diff the other \nother techniques are more traditional \ntechniques that are actually very good \nas well \nand they are very easy to train do not \nhave use so many computational \ncomputational capacities so that that's \ni always like the ideas of keeping it \nsimple \nand then having a model that actually \nworks \nyeah actually worked is important \nlike \ni think it's because of like the \nthe appeal of using unstructured data is \nso appealing with deep neural networks \nthat you forget that like once you have \na tabular structure once you have a \nsymbolic schema now say like xgboost is \nthe new state of the art and um \nand deep learning is going to be like \nharder to adapt and maybe you have \nthings like missing values all these \nother things that come with \nlike these more traditional kind of data \nscience tools and that \nthinking on that kind of aspect of it \nso i think we've covered a ton of \ninteresting topics from uh image search \ntext search and the frontier of applying \ndeep learning for search into e-commerce \nplatforms uh is there anything else sort \nof that we might have missed with the \nparticular application domain of \ne-commerce with deep learning for search \num \n[Music] \nwell what's interesting in the in \ne-commerce is that um so many of the the \nmodels the language models right now \nthey're trained on \nlarge stretches of text but \noften in e-commerce you don't have that \nespecially if you look at the queries \nthey're generally \nlike two three words and that's it and \nthat's that's also interesting to look \nat if the i know i know there are some \nmodels that are more trained on on \nshorter stretches of text um \num \nbut there there that is also a challenge \nfor e-commerce there isn't really \na standard language model that is \nespecially trained for e-commerce yet so \num that will be interesting in the \nfuture if someone would \nbe able to train that i think that would \nhelp a lot of \npeople yeah i love that thinking about \nthat like um style shift it's like kind \nof an abstract concept i mean it's very \nconcrete when you describe style as \nshort sequences of text compared to long \nsequences of text but as we've uh been \ndoing the po we va podcast say um you're \ntraining a \nchatbot model and you're going from \nreddit conversations into \nreal podcast conversations and kind of \nthat style shift from the underlying \ndomain is such an interesting thing and \ni guess like with my kind of like \nacademic side of this i i think these \ndata augmentation techniques could be \nreally interesting as i've kind of \npresented this idea of maybe learning a \nstyle transfer model so like a textile \ntransfer model that could \naugment your data set by using \nby using this kind of generative model \ni know a lot of people who really build \nthese systems for real are kind of \nskeptical about that idea of adding \nanother model into the pipeline of \ngenerating training data what do you \nthink about synthetic data and data \naugmentation as a technique to improve \nthese models \num \n[Music] \ni \nthink \num \nit's an interesting idea and \ni think in many cases it can work really \nwell but um \ni always think it's a bit tricky um \nif your your data isn't \nuh great or it isn't isn't that clean \nand \nit's very difficult to um \nwell if you keep training with the data \nthen uh it will only become more noisier \nso \nthat yeah i think that that's definitely \nsomething that you have to look out for \nbut in general \num \nyeah \nusing some data augmentation techniques \ncan be really really helpful of course \nyeah \nyeah i think especially if you're trying \nto use say generative adversarial \nnetwork scans for data augmentation then \nyou have this problem of mode collapse \nand then if you sample from that you're \njust adding that mode collapse bias and \nclustering your your data even more on \nthat one point so it \nand then just generally that idea of \nlike compounding errors of your \ngenerative model makes an error and now \nyou put it into your discriminative \nmodel and it just runs away with the air \ni like techniques like maybe variational \nauto encoders or these diffusion models \nthat maybe have these explicit \nobjectives around encouraging diversity \nin the generative model i think with \nthese language models the way that you \ndo the tree structured decoding like how \nwith like open ai's codecs they \ngenerate like a thousand different \npotential generations and they call this \nrepeated sampling where they traverse \nthe generation tree several times and \nthen put that into the compiler to see \nwhat doesn't like have an error because \nthis is a model that generates code so \nthese kind of maybe tree structured \ndecoding strategies could be a way to \nachieve that diversity in the generative \nmodel \nyeah that's very interesting \nyeah \nyou know that like idea of the \ngenerative model but i think also just \nlike the way that retrieve then read \nadds that interpretability is also such \nan important part of building these \nsystems and \nso are you \nlike inspired by say these recent \nadvances like deepmind's retro model \nmaybe facebook's internet augmented \ngeneration or openai's web gpt where \nwe're seeing maybe less hype around this \nidea that like let's just build trillion \nparameter language models and maybe more \nof a recent idea into let's decompose \nthe task into information retrieval and \nthen supervised learning yeah i think um \ni think in general maybe i'm not such a \nbeliever in like one \ngreat ai that solves everything i think \num \ndividing it into subtasks it will be a \nmuch more effective \nthan uh \nthan one one that \none-size-fits-all \nyeah it kind of comes back into this \nlike end-to-end like people like this \nend-to-end idea where \nyou know instead of featurization and \nlearning we just put it into one \npipeline and maybe \neverything could be end to end but maybe \nsometimes we need to have a task \ndecomposition and \nsay like multi-task learning doesn't \nreally always work that well maybe if \nyou have things like as you mentioned \nthe t5 framework that unifies these \ntasks into at least you kind of have \nlike a similar gradient scale when \nyou're trying to do multi-task learning \nthat idea of like decomposing \nthe end-to-end pipeline into subtasks \nwhat do you think about that kind of \nidea of just like let's make this whole \nthing end to end make everything \ncontinuous anything discrete let's put a \ncontinuous relaxation on it and just try \nto do gradients through this whole thing \nuh \ni'm not sure i don't it would be cool if \nit works but i i \nuh i have my doubts actually \ndo you have similar doubts in that kind \nof scope of one model that performs all \nthe tasks to the idea of off-the-shelf \npre-trained embeddings like one model \nthat say covers all the distributions of \ndata do you think those two kind of \nideas are the same the idea of \nend-to-end i can learn every task this \ngpt-n is the language model that does \neverything and then this idea that say \nlike clip and is the embedding model for \neverything \num \n[Music] \nwell one of what i've learned from my \nexperience with clip is that \nit is very useful \nas you as i said we don't have the data \nbut \num \nif you have any labeled data and you can \nfind units for your specific task it's \nalways better in my in my experience \num but it's it's it's very useful to \nhave the the general general model \ngeneral embeddings as a baseline um \nbut if if you can fine-tune it to any \nspecific task then yeah that would \nalways have my my uh \nmy preference \nalso for example the gt3 model i think \ngt3 is amazing and all the the \nall the capabilities it's really great \nbut um \nwith with the prompt engineering it's \nit's very difficult if to \nto steer it in your exact direction \nit can do so much \nbut um what we've seen a lot a lot of \ntimes that it \num it will generate great texts that are \nlike you can't tell if they're they're \nhuman written or ai written \nbut um it will also just make up stuff \nand since it's so well written you don't \nknow that it's actually made up \nbut \na lot of times information is not true \nand then there's a is the problem like \nhow are you gonna check if it's not true \nor if it is um and \nso it's it's difficult with such models \nto to steer it in into a \ndirection that you you actually want \nso if you can fine-tune anything of \ncourse you can now find your gp3 as well \nand i think that that's also a great \nmove forward to \nstill leverage the capabilities of the \nmodel but then actually steer it into \nyour direction \nyeah that topic of fine-tuning language \nmodels \nor steering yeah i like that steering \nword too it's really a really nice way \nof like trying to think of like ah move \nthis big powerful towards some \nuseful direction and yeah i like maybe \nlike two techniques like as we mentioned \nthis idea of like generating a massive \ntree of potential decodings and then \nputting a discriminative model that \nparses that tree or maybe we've seen \nrecent advances from openai on \nusing reinforcement learning to train a \nreward model and then use that to kind \nof fine-tune the model or maybe you \ncould just have supervised learning \nwhere you have some sequence to sequence \ndata set and you um fine-tune it on that \nbut i wanted to come a little bit back \nto this idea of \nfine-tuning versus off-the-shelf models \nparticularly with these embeddings and i \nwonder like if you think that maybe \nthere is a fine-tuning bias where as we \nsay that like having labels it generally \nimproves it but is that maybe because \nlike the train test split is from the \nsame distribution of labels and that \nmight kind of bias your thinking into \nsaying that well clearly i have this \ntrain test split and it's better on my \ntest set once it's been fine-tuned on \nthis train set compared to maybe \nsacrificing the robustness and the zero \nshot flexibility that is kind of like \nmaybe like the key advertisement of \nthese models like as you fine-tune it \nand you evaluate it and you say these \nlabels have made it better is that \nbecause you know you're evaluating it on \nthe same distribution of labels and \nyou're not really doing say like data \naugmentation corruption tests or \nwhatever like a domain shift test you \ncould like i don't think there even are \ngreat tools for that do you think like \nyou're not like maybe people aren't \nproperly evaluating how robust their \nmodels are when they say that the fine \ntune model is better than the \noff-the-shelf model \num \nwell i think i agree with what you're \nsaying that of course if you're you're \nfine-tuning then you're you're losing \nsome of the the zero or the few shot \ncapabilities \num \nyeah of course that's true um \ni've never actually \nlike \nfine-tuned on a general data set that \nwasn't specific to a task so i don't \nknow if \nthat would have helped \nlike \nstill like maintaining the zero shot \ncapabilities um \nbut i think \num if you're fine-tuning for a specific \ntask then that's \nuh if you you lose that the the other \ncapabilities then um \n[Music] \nof course you should be aware of that \nbut i don't think that should be \nproblematic um \nbut yeah you should definitely be aware \nthen that if you're functioning for it \nfor one task it won't scale to a \ndifferent task yeah that's that's the \nthat's something you will lose yeah \ndo you think maybe those the \noff-the-shelf way to then the fine-tune \nmodel could be combined in that \nabstraction layer where we talked about \nputting a random forest layer on top of \ndifferent outputs of retrieval or do you \nthink \nlike yeah like having some kind of \nrandom forest on top of the two \nfrom the off the shelf and the fine tune \ndo you think that would be useful or is \nthat just reaching for something \num so \nthen you would put the embeddings in a \nrandom forest and \nmaybe i think i think even \njust the output of the distance to the \nquery maybe like as we talked about just \nhaving like five distances returned from \ntfi fbm 25 and the esper it's like the \ntwo distances of the pre-trained and \nthen the fine tune is it earlier i \nmentioned the weight space ensembling \ntechnique i think this paper was from \nthe allen institute in the university of \nwashington maybe others i'm i don't \nexactly remember but it's like this idea \nthat you do \nan ensembling of the weights as you go \nalong that path from the clip \npre-trained checkpoint that open ai \nreleases down into this \nfine-tune thing and you could have some \nway of combining the outputs from each \nof those two checkpoints \nand maybe generalizing that with our \nidea of the random force abstraction on \ntop of these retrieval models \nyeah it's a very interesting idea not i \ni'm not really sure how that would work \nactually but um \n[Music] \nyeah i i think \nit would yeah it would be interesting \ni'm not i'm not really visually \nvisualizing it right now \nyeah \ni think those diagrams and maybe the \nretrieval pipelines it's like maybe they \nneed to be interactive diagrams or you \ncan like yeah press plus and add more \nretrievals and stuff like that \nso as we've covered so many topics i \nhave maybe like a meta question for you \nis just asking like um what are your \nfavorite sources of information your \nfavorite strategies to improve your \nskills as a data scientist \num \nwell there are a lot actually i i really \nlove \nworking with with people for example now \nfor this customer that we're building a \nsearch engine we're working with people \nfrom all over the world and people who \nhave a lot of experience in search and \njust being able to work with those \npeople and get the knowledge from them \nuh doing some pair programming uh \nsessions with them and that that helps a \nlot and that's that's very interesting \nand i think that that's maybe my my \nfavorite way \nbut also just um \nlike reading vlogs on on medium or \num what watching the videos of the scale \nai conference for example i think that's \nthat's very interesting as well so \nyeah i think the i prefer it to be like \nin person that that's my my favorite way \nbut they'll there are so many ways to to \nget new knowledge and it's \nit's unending \n[Laughter] \nyeah i agree the in-person thing \ndefinitely adds like having a conference \nor definitely adds a lot to it and it's \nfunny also mentioning the scale ai \nconference that was such a superstar \nlineup of uh talks they had this year it \nreally was if people are looking for \nmaybe something to watch that scale ai \nconference you have like clement de lang \nrichard sacha like a lot of these \nleaders of these massive companies that \nwe're talking about most of the time \nso yeah that was a super cool thing so \nthank you so much karen i learned so \nmuch from uh talking to you about all \nthese topics and uh good luck with these \nprojects on ecommerce such an \ninteresting application the squadron \nmachine learning company it all sounds \nso exciting and cool \nyeah thank you very much connor \n[Music] \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Podcast #9
