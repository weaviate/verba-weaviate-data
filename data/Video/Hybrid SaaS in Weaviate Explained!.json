{"text": "Hey everyone! Here is a clip from our newest Weaviate podcast with Farshad Farahbakhshian, Gen AI specialist at AWS and ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching we've yet on YouTube we have a \nsuper exciting new podcast announcing \nweeviate on the AWS Marketplace to kick \nthings off I think this is a really \ninformative clip from Eddie and delocker \nCTO and co-founder of weeviate \nexplaining how hybrid SAS works we \nstarted off with this conversation topic \naround different uses of multi-tenancy \nfrom separating different Cloud \ninstances from each other to users \nwithin a weeviate instance so with that \nsaid let's dive into it here's edian on \nhybrid SAS yeah so with tenancy because \nI talked about multi-tenancy before but \nin a very different context so it's kind \nof a a difficult term because before \nmulti-tenancy referred to our users \nhaving multiple users in this case now \ntenancy refers to assert the isolation \nboundaries within AWS so \num so so let's say our chat bot \napplication from before is an AWS \ncustomer they don't want their data to \nbe mixed up with competing chatbot \napplication but still within sort of \nthis single tenancy setup they might \nhave multiple users so it's an a term \nused in multiple settings nevertheless \nthe concepts are exactly the same for us \nso data that shouldn't leave a certain \nrealm and this is this is something \nwhere \num the the sort of again those using the \nsame term the single tendency nature of \nyour own bv-8 deployment in your private \nVPC in your Cloud tenant \num that that gives you the capability to \nstay completely in control so um touch \nupon this at the very beginning \num if you want just something fast up \nand running just use her VBA cloud \nservice or you bv8 cloud service in in \nthat definition of tenancy is \nmulti-tenant so that means other \ncustomers that use the VBA cloud service \nrun in the same AWS project for example \non our cloud service if you have these \nrequirements for for strict isolation \nyou can run it in your own \num yeah we say in your own VPC and the \nVPC is in your Cloud tenant so it's \nbasically whatever kind of boundaries \nyou you want to Define and you can do \nthis this is something that we're we're \nlaunching right now as we're recording \nthis it's not public yet maybe it will \nbe when we're uh depends on depends on \nhow long it takes to edit this or if \nwe're just about to launch on the VV uh \non the AWS Marketplace we're launching \nDV8 on the AWS Marketplace \num and it's a one-click deployment kind \nof setup where we can do exactly that so \nif you have an existing VPC you can \ndeploy into that VPC if you're starting \nfrom scratch you can create a new VPC \nand this is the the kind of setting \nwhere you can make sure that because \nyour data that's contained in vv8 is \nthen wherever E8 is deployed so exactly \nthe same concept it can never be \naccessed by anyone else it can never be \nmixed up with someone else no one else \nhas access you are completely in control \nif you tomorrow you decide you want to \ntear it down you want to delete the \ndisks you are in in that kind of kind of \ncontrol which is great for for all kinds \nof yeah security compliance Etc settings \nuh the the downside basically is that \nit's it's potentially a bit more \noperations effort because now you're \nrunning vb8 and this is where our hybrid \nSAS idea comes in so with hybrid SAS \nbasically the vva team helps you run \nthis so depending on how much data data \nyou're willing to give away for example \none thing that you could opt into is \nsaying like hey I want to push my \nmetrics to the vva team then what we can \ndo is monitor the metrics so you can say \nlike hey you're about to run out of XYZ \nor we see a pattern here there or maybe \nif something happens \num then then and you're reaching out for \nfor support to us and we can say like \nokay we we have the kind of Diagnostics \nuh tools that we need or another option \nis like even if you can't even share \nmetrics then we can also in the in the \nsort of uh least common denominator \nwould be we can jump on a zoom call and \nmaybe there's maybe a sort of figure out \nwhat's going on together so you get like \nvarious levels of of support contracts \nand support uh settings in that that \nkind of hybrid SAS setting where \num yeah the the sort of underlying thing \nis you own your data and we help you \nwith the operations part as much as you \nwant \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Hybrid SaaS in Weaviate
