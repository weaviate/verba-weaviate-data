{"text": "Hey everyone, thank you so much for watching the 52nd episode of the Weaviate Podcast with Yana Welinder! Yana is the ... \nhey everyone thank you so much forwatching the wevia podcast I'm superexcited to welcome Yana wellender theCEO and founder of craftful craftful isone of the Chachi BT plugins that hascaptured my imagination on what thiskind of thing could look like it'sreally shown me uh what this kind ofidea of a product manager kind ofcompressed into prompt templates and allthese things so I'm so excited towelcome you all into the podcast I alsouh so I reached out to you on thatasking if she joined the podcast to talkabout craftful and also did some moreresearch on Yana and you have such anamazing background in uh in Stanford lawschool and all these cool things that Ithink you'll offer you know so muchinformation to the podcast and ourlisteners hopefully so Jana thank you somuch for joining the podcast thanks forhaving me really really excited to behere awesome so could we maybe startwith maybe like the overview of uhcraftful and then I think we could divemore into the product management the thecomponents of it and then maybe comeback into the chat gbt Marketplaceabsolutely yeah so so craftful we'rebuilding this complete copilot forproduct managers and other productBuilders but this idea thatum our number one place where we startis to help you make sense of all thedifferent user data that you're gettingfrom various sources uh we also help youunderstand kind of how to do productmanagement really well that's reallywhere where our plugin comes into playum but over time we want to be thatco-pilot for for product Builders to toautomate away all the tedious tasks sothat's uh folks can focus on the stuffthey're really really passionate aboutlike building building awesome productsusing all of this informationyeah it's amazing I mean I because to meit's like the the the workflows thecommon skills that are used acrossproduct management that you'veabstracted into prompts can you kind oftalk a little bit more like I know userfeedback is one example I saw oncraftfulyeah absolutely so I think user feedbackis really kind of like one of the mostimportant roles of a product manager isto really understand the user andunderstand the user needs and so thatinvolves collecting user feedbackum but also you know deciphering thatfeedback right from from lots ofdifferent sources so that's that's bothqualitative user feedback like userinterview notes and and surveys andquantitative so usage data uh analyticsthat kind of stuffum but on the qualitative side I wouldsay kind of the best PMS tend to notjust use the stuff that they get fromum from surveys and user interview notesbecause you usually with that you'reGathering a small group of people andyou're asking them lots of questions soit's not necessarily superrepresentative of your uh user base andeven even if you can manage to get itvery representative it's it tends to bequite detached from The Experienceitself you also have thisumvolume of user feedback that that thecompany gets through various channelsthat can sometimes be much more in inthe flow of a user actually using aproduct and having an experience andgiving you feedback on that so that'sthings like obviously App Store reviewsbut also support tickets sales calltranscripts all of thatbody of feedback you really want to beable to incorporate into the productdevelopment process but then of coursethe PM then has all of these otherthings that they're supposed to be doingthat that's much morethat's much more uh you know in theirday-to-day like it's communicating withstakeholders uh coordinating the devTeam all of those individuals areconstantly kind of like screaming at thePM the users are not doing that in thesame kind of way where it's visiblewhether you listen to the users or youdon't right so that tends to get almostde-prioritized even though it's the mostcritical component of product managementand and so I so there are some kind oflike typical best practices for managinguser feedback that say like you knowprofessional product managers wouldwould study and so so are these thencompressed into prompts and then that solike the chat gbt plug-in is it like aset of problems for you know here's aCSV uh with data about like a userinterview study we did and then so theThe Prompt is like how to analyze thedata and um and like chat with with youknow Conor the product manager yeahum so I guess what one thing that Ishould kind of uh clarify up front iswhat what our plugin does today is justa subset of what craftful does whichactually does not include analysis ofuser feedback as it is todayum that's and I can talk about kind ofwhy why we made those product choices uhand uh there's there's a lot that wentinto kind of the defining scope of theplug-in versus the full product but inthe full product and that's exactlyright and so we we really are applyingcertain prompts to user feedback to getthe kind of insights you would want toget out of the feedback to be able toum to make the product betterspecifically we're we're trying to getat the the feature requests what peoplelove about the product what theycomplain uh about the productum and then we've designed the flowwhere you get by default these kind ofGeneral product topics and then you candive deeper and we tell you what kind ofquestions you may want to ask to get atmore kind of insightful informationspecific to your products in featuresout of all of the body of user feedbackcan we do that with the chat that haskind of a personality or or thereasoning of a product manager so thatit it's not exactly like chat that it'sit's just a different personality whichis like it's not as chatty it's not asfun it's much more of a PMyeah that's so interesting so it's likea it's like a role-playing you have likerole-playing prompts where you you addsome extra context like because Iremember like being like in thebeginning of um chat GBC people be likeyou are young lacun like famous AIscientists and it would result in abetter response by kind of protecting itthat way I mean so so I guess so I guessthe other thing like we think about alot about like retrieval augment togeneration at webva Vector databaseslike you know how do you take yourspecific information and then you take asearch query retrieve the specificinformation pass the language model youknow to get better responses is thatkind of a part of craftful as well as iscreating like this you know informationstore of product management bestpractices so that so that you kind ofyou know and then you offer that as theproductwe have we kind of have two essentiallytwo flows one is one is around userfeedback analysis and the other isaroundum looking at all the different productbest practices that are out the internetis a very noisy place when it comes toproduct in particular because everyonesort of think of themselves as a kind ofperson so there's just so muchinformation out there that if you justask ask this question to the internet orask it to the internet via chat gbtum you're not likely to get veryinsightful answers or they may seeminsightful but they're not necessarilygoing to be and so we really try toalmost curate what is what are theactual best practices that what is thethat body of feedback so that we canguide you uh through that and thenultimately we want those twoumthose twofeatures to meet in the middle whereactually the analysis is leveraging thebest practices so that we can uh otherthan just our best practices that wealready kind of uh um built into theproduct to constantly evolve based onall of the different kind of thedifferent flows in in channels thatwe're gettingit's amazing it's like so amazing how uhyeah you take such a complex algorithmlike you know being a product managerand then you compress you turn it intosoftware in this new kind of Paradigm ofthat I think there are so manyinteresting things that the first ofwhich that I want to break apart is thisconcept of like you know you you'vecurated this information do you thinklike the value going forward of having ahighly curated set of information willincrease over time because of productslike this and the chat gbtyeah I mean I think I think generallyjust like classifying what is highquality and what is not I think overtime just based on the usage there'sprobably going to be lots of data therethat will help determine what what's awhat's a high quality Source versus alow quality Source I don't I don'timagine this being kind of like therelevancyumalgorithm in Google but somethingbecause that too is not necessarilydoesn't give you some a real sense ofquality necessarily it just it's a senseof popularityum but I think this some something likethat I think over time I imagine being apart ofum both specific tools like ours andalso just generally kind of like Chachipity anotherum chat Bots that they become better atgetting a sense of what's what's goodand what's bad over time based on youknow just having humans in the loop andinteracting with the with the feedbackyeah it it makes me think a lot aboutlike the future of kind of like contentcreation kind of and like how youinteract with people's content like youknow I trust your advice for productmanagement so like whatever you'recurating like as it is now it's like sayyou know you had a YouTube channel whereyou were kind of like saying here's thenews about here's here's the new stuffand and now it's like instead of justkind of creating like videos or blogposts and stuff now you create like thisuh this thing that is like uh it's likea it is like software from yourknowledge kind of is it is to me it'slike a new kind of course almost likeit's like it is yeah like the evolutionof like information products it I thinkit's quite passing with this thing somaybe pivoting topics I really wanted toget your perspective on kind of the chatgbt Marketplace and you mentioned thatcraftful so it sounds like you're you'reon both sides of the fence where the APIlives in craftful which is like yoursoftware and then you also bring it tothe plug-in Marketplace how are youseeing these two things yeah so in on onour side on the craftful side weobviously we leverage a lot of differentmodels so it's a combination of bothboth the turbo model which is really theonly thing that that our plugin gets tointeract with but also uh gpt3 and gpt4and you know we have various ways tocombine that together to be able toum interact with something that's a muchlarger than the context window that wewould be able to to leverage directlyinto activity so that's a very differentand that's kind of what we need to havefor this like body of feedback whereyou're constantly feeding supporttickets right like that's going to bethat's gonna be a ton of dataand then on the other side of that in inthe pluginum so we were actually very very earlywith developing our plugin I think wewere on the first cohort of developersdeveloping ours we we launched we werein the first group of folks launching itin in the in the plugin storeum and in fact that was sort of aninteresting aspect in its own rightbecause when we lunch there wasn't awhole lot of users that had access toplugins so we weren't getting feedbackjust in the very early days and thenwell people adopted and started gettingfeedback on it but um one thing thatwe've been really mindful of uh whendesigning our Plugin or thinking throughwhat's what what features should weoffer today that's not that's not to saythat's over time it's not going to havemuch more of what what craft was todaybutum the the kind of uh things we'rethinking about is what does that userexperience look like and what's easy fora user to do through a plugin I thinkthere I was very much leaning on and ina prior life prior to craftful I washead of product at ift or IFTTT ifyou've heard about any any of thosenamesum and uh in in and so obviously we werethisum Integrations platform where userswere enabling uh Integrations betweendifferent products via ift and the bigobservation for me was always thatauthentication was really the drop-offin the user experience and so any pointwhere you have to authenticateum and then second to that was any kindof settingsum and so we really were mindful of thatthat this is this is a very new userexperience that's going to be reallytricky for people to kind of understandokay chat GPT in itself is new thenplugins on top of that are newusers are going to struggle with that soif if we on top of that add on anythingthat requires authentication uh and thenhave you know specific settings that youkind of need to have for for the kind ofexperience we currently have on craftfulproperum that's probably going to mean that noone's going to use that plugin soum so we're just sort of just thinkingthrough out of all the things thatcraftful is what can we bring to chatgbt that's actually going to be valuablepeople will useand so that's where the product coachwascame into place was like that's youdon't need to authenticate anything uhyou don't you can really just startusing it and ask it questions and andabout best practices and uh and I thinkso far it's turned out to be true likepeople have had lots of use of itbecause it's been so easy to usecompared to you know some some of theother plugins because it's just it'sit's it's complicated it's going to geteasier over time but it is so far it'scomplicated to useyeah yeah that's so powerful I think umit makes me think uh like I don't knowif this is too much of a like too muchof a stretch to compare it to say likehow you kind of tailor your content todifferent uh like social media platformslike to Twitter I write a short you knowdescription of text Medium right alongarticle like and so it's like you'veyou've taken apart a particular part ofyour product that fit that can live onthe plug-in Marketplace but then the theyour website has more functionality andso maybe I think even a better betterknowledge that's a great analogy butthen the other thing is sort of like howyou've previously would be designingyour product to be to live on the web inone context because that's where you'resitting next to your computer or it's onyour phone right that you're on on thego you're gonna want things more shortform that's kind of why Twitter is shortform tooum and sort of there's already examplesof that where you're developing productsfor different platforms uh and and youkind of have to take into account what'sthat user experience look likeyeah that's definitely a better exampleyeah um so I think so with but when youdo have user data you can get a muchbetter experience because you you knowit becomes like a data managementplatform so as so can you walk methrough a little more about how the fullcraftful Works how it collects all thedata and sends that to chat gbt and justkind of how you think about that kind ofsystem design yeah absolutely so on oncraftfulum usersum sign in and then the very first thingthey're invite us to because we reallywant you to have that aha moment asquickly as possible is to connect yourdata sources and so you can you can dothings like uh connect your supporttickets that's usually an oauth uh welluh or you can select an app from uh fromiOS or or Android apps and then you loadApp Store reviews for for that app uh oryou can upload CSV files or uh or just atech stock to analyze that's usually forthings like user entry notes or or callall transcripts and then we run acombination of prompts on all of thatfeedbacks we pull we pull in on all ofthat feedback we break it down when it'sa large volume of feedback and we kindof we do what we call it kind ofsummaries of summaries where we runtypes of prompts to summarize it incertain ways and then we apply theseproduct prompts uh on on this data toget product insights from themum and then on top of that we in withwith that we use a combination of gbt3gpt4 and actually also turbo becausebecause it does make sense in certaincontextsum and then and then then there's twothings you can do with that one is youcan you can chat with some race offeedback on top of that to kind of learnmore Beyond specifically what we the theinsights that we pulled out for youautomatically and then the other thingyou can do is to use something that wecall our reverse analysis where we weactually do the opposite wayumAssociates summaries that we got kind ofthe product specific summaries that wegot to the original feedback so that youcan read that feedback in context andlearn more about what the user actuallywanted or what you know kind of like alittle bit more about what what'sactually their problem Beyondspecifically what they're asking foryeah there's um so I think a couplethings apart is firstly I think thatthat kind of like summarization promptsI think just hearing again your like howyou are using it is just a testimony tothe power of that prompt like you knowsome problem like please summarize thefollowing documents you'll receive themone at a time as well as a summary sofar and just looping through that Ithink that problem has added so muchvalue in so many waysum so I I definitely want to ask thiskind of topic of like prompt engineeringuh like this kind of idea of tweakingyour prompts how much do you kind oftweak these problems did is it aboutlike discovering totally new Conceptslike the summaries or you mentioned it'skind of like invert the feedback kind ofis that like a prompt as well or is itjust like linking it is so we've I wouldsay like the the origin the first uhprompts uh the earliest prompts uh forfor what we have on craftful I kind ofwrote back in like early 2020 and sincethen they've evolved so so so many timesI probably have lost track ofum so it's a constant Evolution and thatis that that's a combination of how themodels have evolved because back thenprompt engineering is actually so muchmore complex than it is todayum and so we like you had to have muchmuch more complex prompts to getsomething something meaningful at alland at some point in much less problemengineering and you can kind of cut downon a lot of the additional stuff thatyou did to reason in certain waysum so that's one one kind of evolutionuh of our prompt engineering the othertype is just as we connected differenttypes of sources some that are uh richwith product insights like say userinterview notes uh versus some that arenot so rich with with product insightslike support tickets or or calltranscripts we've learned a lot fromuh those different types ofum user feedback sources and how toapply different types of prompts to getto get product insights out of themright because we're not actually justsummarizingum the the feedback we are really justlooking for very specific types ofinsights in in all of that that feedbackum so that's that's been the kind of theother kind of evolution and then andthen on top of that is sort of like thisadditional piece around okay but nowwe're also building new features andthose new features need a completely newset of prompts to enable things likereverse analysissoum well I I guess the other like a quicknote before coming back to the promptengineering topic is um I think inaddition to that summarization chain theother thing is like mapreduce chainwhere you apply like um so like doesthis product review mention let's sayref is like a weba feature like doesthis product review mentioned rough toback and it just applies that on eachchunk of user review and then takesthose answers and then Aggregates themwith another problem but yeah I thinkanother just another I think likesummarization chains and mapreduce thoseare like two of the most like ubiquitousprompts and then you have the specificexample of and but so so you mentionedstarting in 2020 so you you know musthave been an early believer in likebecause you know I've been also workingin AI like you know I was in my PhD thistime not like working with you like umyou know 2020 I don't I don't think itwas you know clear that this was gonnasucceed like this like you could justtell it to do a task and it could do thetest yeah so so what made you kind of anearly believer in just being able toprompt itso I think I I wasn't necessarily anearly believer[Music]problems I've myselfit's very first time I got to playaround with this technology that's thethat's this is the very problem Iapplied it toum and and I think actually my takeawaywas that it didn't do a great job of itback then the first prototype I builtwasn't wasn't summarizing feedback in agreat way but I could I I started seeingthe promise there and so I continuedcoming back to it I would say you knowit wasn't actually we didn't have it inproduction until 2021um and before that we had much more sortof like an analytics productum uh that analyzed interaction datamuch more so than than the the userfeedback so it it was much more of aexperimentation to see can can I solvethis problem that I've had as a productmanagerum you know in in have been trying toumsolve through you know thematic analysistools and really not been uh happy withwith that outcomeum and so when I when I when I gotaccess to to to experiment with uh withgpt3 back then that's kind of the firstthe first thing I applied it towell you know that's that's reallyreally interesting um I mean yeah the Iremember just so like the few shotprompting where you give a few examplesmaybe yeah wow that's so interesting umso pivoting topics a little bit I'mcurious aboutum like your use of user data at craftfoam design of the product like do youdo you think about training your ownlarge language models or like you knowmaybe fine-tuning it for your particularproblem or like you know Connor usingyeah yeah absolutely so I think we'redefinitely going to be fine-tuning a lotover time I don't imagine that'snecessarilyum training our own model though maybemaybe we will over timeum I think you know the the the pacewith which this is developingum it just doesn't seem like a reallygoodum use of time um our team's timespecifically uh because after all we arenot we at least we don't think ofourselves as an AI company we do thinkor a product we do think of ourselves asa product management product solutionrightum and so theum but I do think that definitelyfine-tuningum so I mentioned that we you know ourchat behaves like a product manager andthat's in some senseum a uh conceptually what we want ourproduct to do so we want it you know tothe extent that all large languagemodels are behaving more and more like ahuman over timeum or able to do more and more of humantasks we want our product to to do thetasks we're asking it to do more andmore like a product manager or more andmore like a product manager at aspecific company as opposed to a youknow uh customer support representativerightum that's just a different type of wayof analyzing data and we want uh to tokind of fine-tuneum the model over time to be to toperform more like that and in the way weplan on doing that is just to have usersprovide feedback justum not directly but by interacting withthe summaries and in all of the insightsthat they're getting through craftful inas they uh Mark certain summaries foruse that's a good indication for us thatthat's a good summary right andeverything that they didn't interactwith well that's an indication that wedon't want to have these kind ofsummaries over time so I think there'sthis is just a natural component wherewe can fine tune over time just based oninteraction datayeah it's super interesting and um likebecause kind of wearing the product hatof the product that is craftful and sothe feet so tweaking craftle meanstweaking the prompts that in thesummarization chain rather than tweakingrather than like having this whole mlOps Pipeline and because I think that'san extremely interesting kind ofdevelopment with the few shot zero shotlearning abilities of the models andyeah like how it enables you to do thatkind of thingum yeah maybe I don't know if this wouldbe too like pivoting too much but I'mcurious I'm curious a little furtherlike what you mean by um you know aparticular way of looking at data from aproduct management maybe if we couldtalk about like your the experience ofyour team like and how and kind of sortof like is that you know I I I'm not aproduct manager like what what does itentail generally yeah I mean I thinklike uh one uh just to give you give youkind of a concrete exampleum so we uh yetby applying various prompts we get listsof feature requests and then we getlists of complaints right andum and oftentimesum to a non-product manager theywouldn't necessarily know you knowwhat's a what you know what's whatspecifically is a complaint versus Whatspecifically is a feature requestum they may know but I think if you wereto askum uh your support team to produce twolists you may see a mix of things on onthose listsum and it's going to be kind of veryvaried I think if you ask a productmanager it's going to be pretty you willget pretty solid lists on like here'syour feature requests and here's yourlist of complaints you know that mayvary based on organization there may besome specific things that are consideredone thing and not the otherum and so what we can imagine doing iswhen we present these two lists to aproduct manager you user that is lookingat those lists and when they then selectthe features that they find interestingand they don't select the features thatthey do not that they find uninterestingand that we can see is there like maybea match between those features and somethings that have ended up on thecomplaints listum that's that's a good indication to usthat actually that's why right like sothere's there may be some some thingsthat we can do around how a PM interactswith the output that we can then use tofine-tune the model to behave more likethat PM in the futureit's so fascinating just like um youknow like I working in technology Istruggle enormously with how the thetree of things I could do expands andtrying to like you know prioritize andrank like what which of these like youknow you you can do all these thingswhich ones should you do so like howlike so so conducting that res you knowyou have a list of 10 features and thenyou're thinking okay I think we onlyhave time to do like three of these yeahand then so how do you rank yeah likehow would someone like you think abouthow do you rank that so that's that'sone one aspect of why we created thatreverse analysis was really to give youa sense of a how frequently that each ofthese things come up uh and then B soyou can go back to the original feedbackand that's over time we'll have thingslike if if that's coming from your CRMdataum it may have indications of the typesof customers that are requesting OneThing versus another so it gives youkind of all the different things thatyou normally balance when you try tomake sense of the data and uh and get asense for okay this is a frequentlyrequested feature but it's from all theusers who are not gonna ever pay for ourproduct right[Laughter]bring upyeah I mean yeah I really wanted I I hadyou know I had written down CRM becauseI really like because it seems likethese AI tools are surely about to buildbring a revolution in CRM and how wemanage relationships we you know werecently published this article aboutthis idea of using large language modelsto say right customize advertisementsfor you know in in this blog post we'retalking about like you know you takeAirbnb listings and you like synthesizea text description with the largelanguage model then you write a customreview for like Connor because like youknow I travel with my dog whereas Bob helikes to weight lift so he needs to knowwhere the gym is so like you write thesepersonalized summaries and it's likethis kind of CRM do you think a lotabout like because it seems like you'rein a similar space it's not like quite aCRM but it is kind of yeah I mean Ithink there's in in our case there'sgoing to be other things where we we docustomizehow we then like the you know you canimagine once you have all of thesesummaries you may then want to writeyour jira tickets with them that'sthat's the thing that's that we'reworking on right nowlike right uh stakeholder communicationyou don't necessarily want PMS to begoing around and talking with everyonewhere that could easily have beenhandled and could be actually much morekind of sensitive to that specificpersonlike that politics that is unnecessaryum so I think there's there's a lot ofthose kind of aspects that we will haveover time that's kind of what I mean bythat whole product workflow uh there'sso many things there that can beum can be uhcustomized uh or I should say automatedand then customize to this each specificindividualyeah that's a really interesting book Imean like just kind of my own intuitionit's like sometimes like regardless ofwhat I think might have the best payoutit's like well what do I want to do kindoffor sure yeah yeah I mean like um I'mcurious what you think about this ideaof like so pivoting topics a little bitagain is like multi-aging systems whereyou have multiple large language modelsplaying roles so like I'm the productmanager role-playing large languagemodel and then these are like eightengineer role-playing large languagemodels marketing role-playing like whatdo you think about these kind of systemsI think this is quite ayeah yeah I I honestly don't think thatthat's how uh or for a while that's howteams are going to operate I think likewhen you know when it gets close to likeAGI yes but I think in on on the paththere I'm much more envisioned the worldwhere uh you have you know the AIenabled PM interacting with the AIenabled engineer and the AIuh marketer and all of them areessentially just like AI operators atthat point right like no they're youhave no code writers and you have noword writersbut but I do still think that there'sthere like on at least as far as productdevelopment there's there's there is acertain aspect ofum human intuition that is going to bepretty difficult to replace until we arevery far alongum and so I don't I think it's probablygoing to be less of a kind of an agentrole-playing uh development process fornowyeah I agree I guess I just find theidea to be well I I find it to be reallyfascinating especially with the you knowlike the software engineering kind ofpart where I think a lot about how thelanguage models can write code and alsokind of like test the code that I thinkthe way that they can change it test itthat's the part that reallyinspires my imagination because I yeahlike this kind of feature uh requestthing where it's like if I have 10features they can eat each languagemodel could take one and in parallelstart prototyping it and testing it andseeing how difficult it's going to beandyeah yeah I think I think that so that'sa really interesting idea I thinksomething like that is probably gonnawhen I think about sort of like the AIenabled PM like what is that AI enablingthat PM thenum that there could beum like thethe piece that is writingum the products spec right the AI That'swriting the products back can then bechallenged by the AI That's analyzingthe user feedbackum and you can have that thatinteraction I do imagine uh we'dprobably have to kind of get tosomething that's that's betterum so as it is today right like theum the writing of the spec is alreadyinfluenced by the user feedback right sothere is there's already that happeningbut you can imagine it's also kind ofjust like being more adversarial andchallenging and um and maybe that willget at an even better outcomeyeah amazing um so I I kind of um youknow be stepping back into the highlevel again about the kind of you likeyou're you've prompted chat gbt to havea specific skill set of a productmanager do you see like like a lot ofrelated skills like that like promptedMark like because it sort of sorry letme set the context a little more like asyou're on the plug-in Marketplace so I'mpretty sure Crawford was like one of themost popular apps on there do you likelook at the um you know the cohorts ofwho else is like doing successfully onthe plug-in Marketplace and sort of seewhat they're building and what thetrends are in successful plug-inMarketplace appsum we can't really do that other than wecan see you know we we do we do we keepbeing listed just on Twitter as like oneof the one of you know one of the betterplugins out there like one of the top 10plugins or top 20 plugins and that'sreally the only Insight at this pointwhat's the other one you can see who'sthe other ones on the listbut so far there's very limitedanalytics that we get by being uh on onthe plugin store we've built upanalytics just around you know how muchhow much questions are we gettingum that sort of stuff just to see whatwhat's what does the usage look like butwe don't really have a sense on kind ofit's just early days yeahit is pretty early days still right belike I know we have ABA uh gbt plug-inand I you know I don't work on thatpersonally so I don't really know whatit is but I like I don't know too much Iwould say I we've done like a hackathonaround us I've seen people trying tobuild this thing but we still have it'sstill not quite like app store of it'stoo it's too early to say right at thiscurrent time but but you would prettylike the prediction is like would thisbe like a App Store type ofthing like what's your sentiment on thatmyself is that there's something somesomething like that yes I do think thatthere's probably going to be somethingumsome interface that people interact withall of their different you know agentsor or apps yeah and I I think over timeI imagine it's probably not going to bechat I would think it's you know itwould be something combination of voiceand in some visual interface or you knowsome something that is a little bit moreintuitiveum kind of like I think what we alwayswhat we always dreamed for likesomething like an Alexa but youabsolutely never went in that directionright but but I think yes I I thinkthere's something like that is comingand I do think that the the promise isthere but it's just like very very earlydays so farand I think you'll probably again have abetter analogy for this but like the theiPhone app store to me it has like themoat of like it's on the iPhone that'swhat enables all the apps really and youwould say maybe the language model isthat type of effect but then you cantake the API and disentangle it from theyou know the app the iPhone so that'swhere I think is a little of course youcould like run on Android but is thatand then I see the other side where it'slike just kind of like a marketing playlike kind of like how you know sayproduct hunt has like a list of productsand so like I see it as like either justthe marketing like I did I know aboutcraftful because I go to the plug-inMarketplace and I click on the apps andyou know it's ranked it's high so do yousee those kind of things as being theright way of thinking about it I thinkso yeah I mean I I think that it is itis very possible that there isn't goingto be another way to interact with likeapps or products or websites other thanjust going through something like chatgbt or or the chat GPT and interactingwith plugins and and that that would bethe app interactionum and so in that sense it would beanalogous too it would be in one oneanalogy is the App Store another analogywould just be like that's the browserumwhat what actually is going to be is alittle bit of an up in the air right nowI think like the the folks who aredeveloping in this space will all kindof have to be prepared for just going indifferent directions and and being okaywith that and kind of preparing the teamthat yes you're developing this butactually it may end up looking like thisorum you know like thinking of everythingasum being as much API enabled as it canbe because that makes it also easy toswitch between different Platforms in indifferent kind of just like yourspecific uisum but yes I do think that most likelythere will be some sort ofum chat like chat GPT like experiencethat we'll be interacting with and doyou think that the App Store is sort oflike probably a good good analogy tothat or the app store or the iPhone orthe browser yeah yeah brilliant I thinkthat's all a really great analysis andso sort of wrapping up the podcast I youknow personally this has really inspiredmy interest in craft fall I'm definitelygonna go play with it right after thisand you know I hope a lot of ourlisteners are people you know buildingthings with we V8 and you know AI appsand could could maybe like you do theoverview so like someone listening who'sbuilding some kind of AI product can youmaybe do the introduction to craftful ifit's not yeah so yeah so so craftful asI think you you summarize really well inthe beginning for a co-pilot for productmanagers and product Builders it'sreally at this pointum the way to summarize all of thedifferent user feedback that you getfrom from from different sources so ifyou have um user feedback in app storereviews but also in zendesk supporttickets or intercom or various docs orCSV files that you need to summarize youcan then go in in summaries at all incraftful but specifically with thisproduct angle and be able to connect itso that we're constantly then pullingthat data and analyzing it and sendingit to your mailbox so you don't have toworry about it and you can kind of justcollaborate with your team on all of thefeedbackyeah and I think just the um like thethe the skill of how to do userinterviews is quite interesting like Iyou know I did a computer science degreeand was just hacking with like I imaginea lot of people who listen to thispodcast are also just like computerscientists and don't think about likehow to conduct user interviews and savethis kind of data so I think all thatyeah the the angle of this this this isone of the like skill skills workflowscompressed into like a charge EBT basedapp that has really captured myimagination more than anything else soalso uh kind of in the spirit of podcastcan you maybe tell people like how tokeep up with you and updates and maybeany announcements coming up absolutelyyeah so probably the best the best wayto to keep up with me is I'm very activeon Twitter I'm Jana tweets uh thereum also uh can keep up with withcraftful there our handle is justgrappleum and that probably is the the easiestway to both keep up and and you knowreach out to me and connect with meum the the next few things we have inthe pipeline is just lots and lots ofadditional features obviously you areusing craftful for craftfulourselves been overwhelmed with thatwhich isum we do roll out new things pretty muchevery every week and so a lot of that isnew Integrations new ways of analyzingthe data new ways of summarizing it thejira tickets uh writing functionalitythat kind of alluded to that's coming uhsoon too so lots lots and lots ofexciting stuffawesome Diana thank you so much for yourperspectives on all these things Ilearned so much and yeah it all soundsso excitinghaving me really a fun conversation", "type": "Video", "name": "Yana Welinder on Kraftful - Weaviate
