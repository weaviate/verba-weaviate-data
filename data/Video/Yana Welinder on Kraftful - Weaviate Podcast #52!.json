{"text": "Hey everyone, thank you so much for watching the 52nd episode of the Weaviate Podcast with Yana Welinder! Yana is the ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching the wevia podcast I'm super \nexcited to welcome Yana wellender the \nCEO and founder of craftful craftful is \none of the Chachi BT plugins that has \ncaptured my imagination on what this \nkind of thing could look like it's \nreally shown me uh what this kind of \nidea of a product manager kind of \ncompressed into prompt templates and all \nthese things so I'm so excited to \nwelcome you all into the podcast I also \nuh so I reached out to you on that \nasking if she joined the podcast to talk \nabout craftful and also did some more \nresearch on Yana and you have such an \namazing background in uh in Stanford law \nschool and all these cool things that I \nthink you'll offer you know so much \ninformation to the podcast and our \nlisteners hopefully so Jana thank you so \nmuch for joining the podcast thanks for \nhaving me really really excited to be \nhere awesome so could we maybe start \nwith maybe like the overview of uh \ncraftful and then I think we could dive \nmore into the product management the the \ncomponents of it and then maybe come \nback into the chat gbt Marketplace \nabsolutely yeah so so craftful we're \nbuilding this complete copilot for \nproduct managers and other product \nBuilders but this idea that \num our number one place where we start \nis to help you make sense of all the \ndifferent user data that you're getting \nfrom various sources uh we also help you \nunderstand kind of how to do product \nmanagement really well that's really \nwhere where our plugin comes into play \num but over time we want to be that \nco-pilot for for product Builders to to \nautomate away all the tedious tasks so \nthat's uh folks can focus on the stuff \nthey're really really passionate about \nlike building building awesome products \nusing all of this information \nyeah it's amazing I mean I because to me \nit's like the the the workflows the \ncommon skills that are used across \nproduct management that you've \nabstracted into prompts can you kind of \ntalk a little bit more like I know user \nfeedback is one example I saw on \ncraftful \nyeah absolutely so I think user feedback \nis really kind of like one of the most \nimportant roles of a product manager is \nto really understand the user and \nunderstand the user needs and so that \ninvolves collecting user feedback \num but also you know deciphering that \nfeedback right from from lots of \ndifferent sources so that's that's both \nqualitative user feedback like user \ninterview notes and and surveys and \nquantitative so usage data uh analytics \nthat kind of stuff \num but on the qualitative side I would \nsay kind of the best PMS tend to not \njust use the stuff that they get from \num from surveys and user interview notes \nbecause you usually with that you're \nGathering a small group of people and \nyou're asking them lots of questions so \nit's not necessarily super \nrepresentative of your uh user base and \neven even if you can manage to get it \nvery representative it's it tends to be \nquite detached from The Experience \nitself you also have this \num \nvolume of user feedback that that the \ncompany gets through various channels \nthat can sometimes be much more in in \nthe flow of a user actually using a \nproduct and having an experience and \ngiving you feedback on that so that's \nthings like obviously App Store reviews \nbut also support tickets sales call \ntranscripts all of that \nbody of feedback you really want to be \nable to incorporate into the product \ndevelopment process but then of course \nthe PM then has all of these other \nthings that they're supposed to be doing \nthat that's much more \nthat's much more uh you know in their \nday-to-day like it's communicating with \nstakeholders uh coordinating the dev \nTeam all of those individuals are \nconstantly kind of like screaming at the \nPM the users are not doing that in the \nsame kind of way where it's visible \nwhether you listen to the users or you \ndon't right so that tends to get almost \nde-prioritized even though it's the most \ncritical component of product management \nand and so I so there are some kind of \nlike typical best practices for managing \nuser feedback that say like you know \nprofessional product managers would \nwould study and so so are these then \ncompressed into prompts and then that so \nlike the chat gbt plug-in is it like a \nset of problems for you know here's a \nCSV uh with data about like a user \ninterview study we did and then so the \nThe Prompt is like how to analyze the \ndata and um and like chat with with you \nknow Conor the product manager yeah \num so I guess what one thing that I \nshould kind of uh clarify up front is \nwhat what our plugin does today is just \na subset of what craftful does which \nactually does not include analysis of \nuser feedback as it is today \num that's and I can talk about kind of \nwhy why we made those product choices uh \nand uh there's there's a lot that went \ninto kind of the defining scope of the \nplug-in versus the full product but in \nthe full product and that's exactly \nright and so we we really are applying \ncertain prompts to user feedback to get \nthe kind of insights you would want to \nget out of the feedback to be able to \num to make the product better \nspecifically we're we're trying to get \nat the the feature requests what people \nlove about the product what they \ncomplain uh about the product \num and then we've designed the flow \nwhere you get by default these kind of \nGeneral product topics and then you can \ndive deeper and we tell you what kind of \nquestions you may want to ask to get at \nmore kind of insightful information \nspecific to your products in features \nout of all of the body of user feedback \ncan we do that with the chat that has \nkind of a personality or or the \nreasoning of a product manager so that \nit it's not exactly like chat that it's \nit's just a different personality which \nis like it's not as chatty it's not as \nfun it's much more of a PM \nyeah that's so interesting so it's like \na it's like a role-playing you have like \nrole-playing prompts where you you add \nsome extra context like because I \nremember like being like in the \nbeginning of um chat GBC people be like \nyou are young lacun like famous AI \nscientists and it would result in a \nbetter response by kind of protecting it \nthat way I mean so so I guess so I guess \nthe other thing like we think about a \nlot about like retrieval augment to \ngeneration at webva Vector databases \nlike you know how do you take your \nspecific information and then you take a \nsearch query retrieve the specific \ninformation pass the language model you \nknow to get better responses is that \nkind of a part of craftful as well as is \ncreating like this you know information \nstore of product management best \npractices so that so that you kind of \nyou know and then you offer that as the \nproduct \nwe have we kind of have two essentially \ntwo flows one is one is around user \nfeedback analysis and the other is \naround \num looking at all the different product \nbest practices that are out the internet \nis a very noisy place when it comes to \nproduct in particular because everyone \nsort of think of themselves as a kind of \nperson so there's just so much \ninformation out there that if you just \nask ask this question to the internet or \nask it to the internet via chat gbt \num you're not likely to get very \ninsightful answers or they may seem \ninsightful but they're not necessarily \ngoing to be and so we really try to \nalmost curate what is what are the \nactual best practices that what is the \nthat body of feedback so that we can \nguide you uh through that and then \nultimately we want those two \num \nthose two \nfeatures to meet in the middle where \nactually the analysis is leveraging the \nbest practices so that we can uh other \nthan just our best practices that we \nalready kind of uh um built into the \nproduct to constantly evolve based on \nall of the different kind of the \ndifferent flows in in channels that \nwe're getting \nit's amazing it's like so amazing how uh \nyeah you take such a complex algorithm \nlike you know being a product manager \nand then you compress you turn it into \nsoftware in this new kind of Paradigm of \nthat I think there are so many \ninteresting things that the first of \nwhich that I want to break apart is this \nconcept of like you know you you've \ncurated this information do you think \nlike the value going forward of having a \nhighly curated set of information will \nincrease over time because of products \nlike this and the chat gbt \nyeah I mean I think I think generally \njust like classifying what is high \nquality and what is not I think over \ntime just based on the usage there's \nprobably going to be lots of data there \nthat will help determine what what's a \nwhat's a high quality Source versus a \nlow quality Source I don't I don't \nimagine this being kind of like the \nrelevancy \num \nalgorithm in Google but something \nbecause that too is not necessarily \ndoesn't give you some a real sense of \nquality necessarily it just it's a sense \nof popularity \num but I think this some something like \nthat I think over time I imagine being a \npart of \num both specific tools like ours and \nalso just generally kind of like Chachi \npity another \num chat Bots that they become better at \ngetting a sense of what's what's good \nand what's bad over time based on you \nknow just having humans in the loop and \ninteracting with the with the feedback \nyeah it it makes me think a lot about \nlike the future of kind of like content \ncreation kind of and like how you \ninteract with people's content like you \nknow I trust your advice for product \nmanagement so like whatever you're \ncurating like as it is now it's like say \nyou know you had a YouTube channel where \nyou were kind of like saying here's the \nnews about here's here's the new stuff \nand and now it's like instead of just \nkind of creating like videos or blog \nposts and stuff now you create like this \nuh this thing that is like uh it's like \na it is like software from your \nknowledge kind of is it is to me it's \nlike a new kind of course almost like \nit's like it is yeah like the evolution \nof like information products it I think \nit's quite passing with this thing so \nmaybe pivoting topics I really wanted to \nget your perspective on kind of the chat \ngbt Marketplace and you mentioned that \ncraftful so it sounds like you're you're \non both sides of the fence where the API \nlives in craftful which is like your \nsoftware and then you also bring it to \nthe plug-in Marketplace how are you \nseeing these two things yeah so in on on \nour side on the craftful side we \nobviously we leverage a lot of different \nmodels so it's a combination of both \nboth the turbo model which is really the \nonly thing that that our plugin gets to \ninteract with but also uh gpt3 and gpt4 \nand you know we have various ways to \ncombine that together to be able to \num interact with something that's a much \nlarger than the context window that we \nwould be able to to leverage directly \ninto activity so that's a very different \nand that's kind of what we need to have \nfor this like body of feedback where \nyou're constantly feeding support \ntickets right like that's going to be \nthat's gonna be a ton of data \nand then on the other side of that in in \nthe plugin \num so we were actually very very early \nwith developing our plugin I think we \nwere on the first cohort of developers \ndeveloping ours we we launched we were \nin the first group of folks launching it \nin in the in the plugin store \num and in fact that was sort of an \ninteresting aspect in its own right \nbecause when we lunch there wasn't a \nwhole lot of users that had access to \nplugins so we weren't getting feedback \njust in the very early days and then \nwell people adopted and started getting \nfeedback on it but um one thing that \nwe've been really mindful of uh when \ndesigning our Plugin or thinking through \nwhat's what what features should we \noffer today that's not that's not to say \nthat's over time it's not going to have \nmuch more of what what craft was today \nbut \num the the kind of uh things we're \nthinking about is what does that user \nexperience look like and what's easy for \na user to do through a plugin I think \nthere I was very much leaning on and in \na prior life prior to craftful I was \nhead of product at ift or IFTTT if \nyou've heard about any any of those \nnames \num and uh in in and so obviously we were \nthis \num Integrations platform where users \nwere enabling uh Integrations between \ndifferent products via ift and the big \nobservation for me was always that \nauthentication was really the drop-off \nin the user experience and so any point \nwhere you have to authenticate \num and then second to that was any kind \nof settings \num and so we really were mindful of that \nthat this is this is a very new user \nexperience that's going to be really \ntricky for people to kind of understand \nokay chat GPT in itself is new then \nplugins on top of that are new \nusers are going to struggle with that so \nif if we on top of that add on anything \nthat requires authentication uh and then \nhave you know specific settings that you \nkind of need to have for for the kind of \nexperience we currently have on craftful \nproper \num that's probably going to mean that no \none's going to use that plugin so \num so we're just sort of just thinking \nthrough out of all the things that \ncraftful is what can we bring to chat \ngbt that's actually going to be valuable \npeople will use \nand so that's where the product coach \nwas \ncame into place was like that's you \ndon't need to authenticate anything uh \nyou don't you can really just start \nusing it and ask it questions and and \nabout best practices and uh and I think \nso far it's turned out to be true like \npeople have had lots of use of it \nbecause it's been so easy to use \ncompared to you know some some of the \nother plugins because it's just it's \nit's it's complicated it's going to get \neasier over time but it is so far it's \ncomplicated to use \nyeah yeah that's so powerful I think um \nit makes me think uh like I don't know \nif this is too much of a like too much \nof a stretch to compare it to say like \nhow you kind of tailor your content to \ndifferent uh like social media platforms \nlike to Twitter I write a short you know \ndescription of text Medium right along \narticle like and so it's like you've \nyou've taken apart a particular part of \nyour product that fit that can live on \nthe plug-in Marketplace but then the the \nyour website has more functionality and \nso maybe I think even a better better \nknowledge that's a great analogy but \nthen the other thing is sort of like how \nyou've previously would be designing \nyour product to be to live on the web in \none context because that's where you're \nsitting next to your computer or it's on \nyour phone right that you're on on the \ngo you're gonna want things more short \nform that's kind of why Twitter is short \nform too \num and sort of there's already examples \nof that where you're developing products \nfor different platforms uh and and you \nkind of have to take into account what's \nthat user experience look like \nyeah that's definitely a better example \nyeah um so I think so with but when you \ndo have user data you can get a much \nbetter experience because you you know \nit becomes like a data management \nplatform so as so can you walk me \nthrough a little more about how the full \ncraftful Works how it collects all the \ndata and sends that to chat gbt and just \nkind of how you think about that kind of \nsystem design yeah absolutely so on on \ncraftful \num users \num sign in and then the very first thing \nthey're invite us to because we really \nwant you to have that aha moment as \nquickly as possible is to connect your \ndata sources and so you can you can do \nthings like uh connect your support \ntickets that's usually an oauth uh well \nuh or you can select an app from uh from \niOS or or Android apps and then you load \nApp Store reviews for for that app uh or \nyou can upload CSV files or uh or just a \ntech stock to analyze that's usually for \nthings like user entry notes or or call \nall transcripts and then we run a \ncombination of prompts on all of that \nfeedbacks we pull we pull in on all of \nthat feedback we break it down when it's \na large volume of feedback and we kind \nof we do what we call it kind of \nsummaries of summaries where we run \ntypes of prompts to summarize it in \ncertain ways and then we apply these \nproduct prompts uh on on this data to \nget product insights from them \num and then on top of that we in with \nwith that we use a combination of gbt3 \ngpt4 and actually also turbo because \nbecause it does make sense in certain \ncontexts \num and then and then then there's two \nthings you can do with that one is you \ncan you can chat with some race of \nfeedback on top of that to kind of learn \nmore Beyond specifically what we the the \ninsights that we pulled out for you \nautomatically and then the other thing \nyou can do is to use something that we \ncall our reverse analysis where we we \nactually do the opposite way \num \nAssociates summaries that we got kind of \nthe product specific summaries that we \ngot to the original feedback so that you \ncan read that feedback in context and \nlearn more about what the user actually \nwanted or what you know kind of like a \nlittle bit more about what what's \nactually their problem Beyond \nspecifically what they're asking for \nyeah there's um so I think a couple \nthings apart is firstly I think that \nthat kind of like summarization prompts \nI think just hearing again your like how \nyou are using it is just a testimony to \nthe power of that prompt like you know \nsome problem like please summarize the \nfollowing documents you'll receive them \none at a time as well as a summary so \nfar and just looping through that I \nthink that problem has added so much \nvalue in so many ways \num so I I definitely want to ask this \nkind of topic of like prompt engineering \nuh like this kind of idea of tweaking \nyour prompts how much do you kind of \ntweak these problems did is it about \nlike discovering totally new Concepts \nlike the summaries or you mentioned it's \nkind of like invert the feedback kind of \nis that like a prompt as well or is it \njust like linking it is so we've I would \nsay like the the origin the first uh \nprompts uh the earliest prompts uh for \nfor what we have on craftful I kind of \nwrote back in like early 2020 and since \nthen they've evolved so so so many times \nI probably have lost track of \num so it's a constant Evolution and that \nis that that's a combination of how the \nmodels have evolved because back then \nprompt engineering is actually so much \nmore complex than it is today \num and so we like you had to have much \nmuch more complex prompts to get \nsomething something meaningful at all \nand at some point in much less problem \nengineering and you can kind of cut down \non a lot of the additional stuff that \nyou did to reason in certain ways \num so that's one one kind of evolution \nuh of our prompt engineering the other \ntype is just as we connected different \ntypes of sources some that are uh rich \nwith product insights like say user \ninterview notes uh versus some that are \nnot so rich with with product insights \nlike support tickets or or call \ntranscripts we've learned a lot from \nuh those different types of \num user feedback sources and how to \napply different types of prompts to get \nto get product insights out of them \nright because we're not actually just \nsummarizing \num the the feedback we are really just \nlooking for very specific types of \ninsights in in all of that that feedback \num so that's that's been the kind of the \nother kind of evolution and then and \nthen on top of that is sort of like this \nadditional piece around okay but now \nwe're also building new features and \nthose new features need a completely new \nset of prompts to enable things like \nreverse analysis \nso \num well I I guess the other like a quick \nnote before coming back to the prompt \nengineering topic is um I think in \naddition to that summarization chain the \nother thing is like mapreduce chain \nwhere you apply like um so like does \nthis product review mention let's say \nref is like a weba feature like does \nthis product review mentioned rough to \nback and it just applies that on each \nchunk of user review and then takes \nthose answers and then Aggregates them \nwith another problem but yeah I think \nanother just another I think like \nsummarization chains and mapreduce those \nare like two of the most like ubiquitous \nprompts and then you have the specific \nexample of and but so so you mentioned \nstarting in 2020 so you you know must \nhave been an early believer in like \nbecause you know I've been also working \nin AI like you know I was in my PhD this \ntime not like working with you like um \nyou know 2020 I don't I don't think it \nwas you know clear that this was gonna \nsucceed like this like you could just \ntell it to do a task and it could do the \ntest yeah so so what made you kind of an \nearly believer in just being able to \nprompt it \nso I think I I wasn't necessarily an \nearly believer \n[Music] \nproblems I've myself \nit's very first time I got to play \naround with this technology that's the \nthat's this is the very problem I \napplied it to \num and and I think actually my takeaway \nwas that it didn't do a great job of it \nback then the first prototype I built \nwasn't wasn't summarizing feedback in a \ngreat way but I could I I started seeing \nthe promise there and so I continued \ncoming back to it I would say you know \nit wasn't actually we didn't have it in \nproduction until 2021 \num and before that we had much more sort \nof like an analytics product \num uh that analyzed interaction data \nmuch more so than than the the user \nfeedback so it it was much more of a \nexperimentation to see can can I solve \nthis problem that I've had as a product \nmanager \num you know in in have been trying to \num \nsolve through you know thematic analysis \ntools and really not been uh happy with \nwith that outcome \num and so when I when I when I got \naccess to to to experiment with uh with \ngpt3 back then that's kind of the first \nthe first thing I applied it to \nwell you know that's that's really \nreally interesting um I mean yeah the I \nremember just so like the few shot \nprompting where you give a few examples \nmaybe yeah wow that's so interesting um \nso pivoting topics a little bit I'm \ncurious about \num like your use of user data at craft \nfoam design of the product like do you \ndo you think about training your own \nlarge language models or like you know \nmaybe fine-tuning it for your particular \nproblem or like you know Connor using \nyeah yeah absolutely so I think we're \ndefinitely going to be fine-tuning a lot \nover time I don't imagine that's \nnecessarily \num training our own model though maybe \nmaybe we will over time \num I think you know the the the pace \nwith which this is developing \num it just doesn't seem like a really \ngood \num use of time um our team's time \nspecifically uh because after all we are \nnot we at least we don't think of \nourselves as an AI company we do think \nor a product we do think of ourselves as \na product management product solution \nright \num and so the \num but I do think that definitely \nfine-tuning \num so I mentioned that we you know our \nchat behaves like a product manager and \nthat's in some sense \num a uh conceptually what we want our \nproduct to do so we want it you know to \nthe extent that all large language \nmodels are behaving more and more like a \nhuman over time \num or able to do more and more of human \ntasks we want our product to to do the \ntasks we're asking it to do more and \nmore like a product manager or more and \nmore like a product manager at a \nspecific company as opposed to a you \nknow uh customer support representative \nright \num that's just a different type of way \nof analyzing data and we want uh to to \nkind of fine-tune \num the model over time to be to to \nperform more like that and in the way we \nplan on doing that is just to have users \nprovide feedback just \num not directly but by interacting with \nthe summaries and in all of the insights \nthat they're getting through craftful in \nas they uh Mark certain summaries for \nuse that's a good indication for us that \nthat's a good summary right and \neverything that they didn't interact \nwith well that's an indication that we \ndon't want to have these kind of \nsummaries over time so I think there's \nthis is just a natural component where \nwe can fine tune over time just based on \ninteraction data \nyeah it's super interesting and um like \nbecause kind of wearing the product hat \nof the product that is craftful and so \nthe feet so tweaking craftle means \ntweaking the prompts that in the \nsummarization chain rather than tweaking \nrather than like having this whole ml \nOps Pipeline and because I think that's \nan extremely interesting kind of \ndevelopment with the few shot zero shot \nlearning abilities of the models and \nyeah like how it enables you to do that \nkind of thing \num yeah maybe I don't know if this would \nbe too like pivoting too much but I'm \ncurious I'm curious a little further \nlike what you mean by um you know a \nparticular way of looking at data from a \nproduct management maybe if we could \ntalk about like your the experience of \nyour team like and how and kind of sort \nof like is that you know I I I'm not a \nproduct manager like what what does it \nentail generally yeah I mean I think \nlike uh one uh just to give you give you \nkind of a concrete example \num so we uh yet \nby applying various prompts we get lists \nof feature requests and then we get \nlists of complaints right and \num and oftentimes \num to a non-product manager they \nwouldn't necessarily know you know \nwhat's a what you know what's what \nspecifically is a complaint versus What \nspecifically is a feature request \num they may know but I think if you were \nto ask \num uh your support team to produce two \nlists you may see a mix of things on on \nthose lists \num and it's going to be kind of very \nvaried I think if you ask a product \nmanager it's going to be pretty you will \nget pretty solid lists on like here's \nyour feature requests and here's your \nlist of complaints you know that may \nvary based on organization there may be \nsome specific things that are considered \none thing and not the other \num and so what we can imagine doing is \nwhen we present these two lists to a \nproduct manager you user that is looking \nat those lists and when they then select \nthe features that they find interesting \nand they don't select the features that \nthey do not that they find uninteresting \nand that we can see is there like maybe \na match between those features and some \nthings that have ended up on the \ncomplaints list \num that's that's a good indication to us \nthat actually that's why right like so \nthere's there may be some some things \nthat we can do around how a PM interacts \nwith the output that we can then use to \nfine-tune the model to behave more like \nthat PM in the future \nit's so fascinating just like um you \nknow like I working in technology I \nstruggle enormously with how the the \ntree of things I could do expands and \ntrying to like you know prioritize and \nrank like what which of these like you \nknow you you can do all these things \nwhich ones should you do so like how \nlike so so conducting that res you know \nyou have a list of 10 features and then \nyou're thinking okay I think we only \nhave time to do like three of these yeah \nand then so how do you rank yeah like \nhow would someone like you think about \nhow do you rank that so that's that's \none one aspect of why we created that \nreverse analysis was really to give you \na sense of a how frequently that each of \nthese things come up uh and then B so \nyou can go back to the original feedback \nand that's over time we'll have things \nlike if if that's coming from your CRM \ndata \num it may have indications of the types \nof customers that are requesting One \nThing versus another so it gives you \nkind of all the different things that \nyou normally balance when you try to \nmake sense of the data and uh and get a \nsense for okay this is a frequently \nrequested feature but it's from all the \nusers who are not gonna ever pay for our \nproduct right \n[Laughter] \nbring up \nyeah I mean yeah I really wanted I I had \nyou know I had written down CRM because \nI really like because it seems like \nthese AI tools are surely about to build \nbring a revolution in CRM and how we \nmanage relationships we you know we \nrecently published this article about \nthis idea of using large language models \nto say right customize advertisements \nfor you know in in this blog post we're \ntalking about like you know you take \nAirbnb listings and you like synthesize \na text description with the large \nlanguage model then you write a custom \nreview for like Connor because like you \nknow I travel with my dog whereas Bob he \nlikes to weight lift so he needs to know \nwhere the gym is so like you write these \npersonalized summaries and it's like \nthis kind of CRM do you think a lot \nabout like because it seems like you're \nin a similar space it's not like quite a \nCRM but it is kind of yeah I mean I \nthink there's in in our case there's \ngoing to be other things where we we do \ncustomize \nhow we then like the you know you can \nimagine once you have all of these \nsummaries you may then want to write \nyour jira tickets with them that's \nthat's the thing that's that we're \nworking on right now \nlike right uh stakeholder communication \nyou don't necessarily want PMS to be \ngoing around and talking with everyone \nwhere that could easily have been \nhandled and could be actually much more \nkind of sensitive to that specific \nperson \nlike that politics that is unnecessary \num so I think there's there's a lot of \nthose kind of aspects that we will have \nover time that's kind of what I mean by \nthat whole product workflow uh there's \nso many things there that can be \num can be uh \ncustomized uh or I should say automated \nand then customize to this each specific \nindividual \nyeah that's a really interesting book I \nmean like just kind of my own intuition \nit's like sometimes like regardless of \nwhat I think might have the best payout \nit's like well what do I want to do kind \nof \nfor sure yeah yeah I mean like um I'm \ncurious what you think about this idea \nof like so pivoting topics a little bit \nagain is like multi-aging systems where \nyou have multiple large language models \nplaying roles so like I'm the product \nmanager role-playing large language \nmodel and then these are like eight \nengineer role-playing large language \nmodels marketing role-playing like what \ndo you think about these kind of systems \nI think this is quite a \nyeah yeah I I honestly don't think that \nthat's how uh or for a while that's how \nteams are going to operate I think like \nwhen you know when it gets close to like \nAGI yes but I think in on on the path \nthere I'm much more envisioned the world \nwhere uh you have you know the AI \nenabled PM interacting with the AI \nenabled engineer and the AI \nuh marketer and all of them are \nessentially just like AI operators at \nthat point right like no they're you \nhave no code writers and you have no \nword writers \nbut but I do still think that there's \nthere like on at least as far as product \ndevelopment there's there's there is a \ncertain aspect of \num human intuition that is going to be \npretty difficult to replace until we are \nvery far along \num and so I don't I think it's probably \ngoing to be less of a kind of an agent \nrole-playing uh development process for \nnow \nyeah I agree I guess I just find the \nidea to be well I I find it to be really \nfascinating especially with the you know \nlike the software engineering kind of \npart where I think a lot about how the \nlanguage models can write code and also \nkind of like test the code that I think \nthe way that they can change it test it \nthat's the part that really \ninspires my imagination because I yeah \nlike this kind of feature uh request \nthing where it's like if I have 10 \nfeatures they can eat each language \nmodel could take one and in parallel \nstart prototyping it and testing it and \nseeing how difficult it's going to be \nand \nyeah yeah I think I think that so that's \na really interesting idea I think \nsomething like that is probably gonna \nwhen I think about sort of like the AI \nenabled PM like what is that AI enabling \nthat PM then \num that there could be \num like the \nthe piece that is writing \num the products spec right the AI That's \nwriting the products back can then be \nchallenged by the AI That's analyzing \nthe user feedback \num and you can have that that \ninteraction I do imagine uh we'd \nprobably have to kind of get to \nsomething that's that's better \num so as it is today right like the \num the writing of the spec is already \ninfluenced by the user feedback right so \nthere is there's already that happening \nbut you can imagine it's also kind of \njust like being more adversarial and \nchallenging and um and maybe that will \nget at an even better outcome \nyeah amazing um so I I kind of um you \nknow be stepping back into the high \nlevel again about the kind of you like \nyou're you've prompted chat gbt to have \na specific skill set of a product \nmanager do you see like like a lot of \nrelated skills like that like prompted \nMark like because it sort of sorry let \nme set the context a little more like as \nyou're on the plug-in Marketplace so I'm \npretty sure Crawford was like one of the \nmost popular apps on there do you like \nlook at the um you know the cohorts of \nwho else is like doing successfully on \nthe plug-in Marketplace and sort of see \nwhat they're building and what the \ntrends are in successful plug-in \nMarketplace apps \num we can't really do that other than we \ncan see you know we we do we do we keep \nbeing listed just on Twitter as like one \nof the one of you know one of the better \nplugins out there like one of the top 10 \nplugins or top 20 plugins and that's \nreally the only Insight at this point \nwhat's the other one you can see who's \nthe other ones on the list \nbut so far there's very limited \nanalytics that we get by being uh on on \nthe plugin store we've built up \nanalytics just around you know how much \nhow much questions are we getting \num that sort of stuff just to see what \nwhat's what does the usage look like but \nwe don't really have a sense on kind of \nit's just early days yeah \nit is pretty early days still right be \nlike I know we have ABA uh gbt plug-in \nand I you know I don't work on that \npersonally so I don't really know what \nit is but I like I don't know too much I \nwould say I we've done like a hackathon \naround us I've seen people trying to \nbuild this thing but we still have it's \nstill not quite like app store of it's \ntoo it's too early to say right at this \ncurrent time but but you would pretty \nlike the prediction is like would this \nbe like a App Store type of \nthing like what's your sentiment on that \nmyself is that there's something some \nsomething like that yes I do think that \nthere's probably going to be something \num \nsome interface that people interact with \nall of their different you know agents \nor or apps yeah and I I think over time \nI imagine it's probably not going to be \nchat I would think it's you know it \nwould be something combination of voice \nand in some visual interface or you know \nsome something that is a little bit more \nintuitive \num kind of like I think what we always \nwhat we always dreamed for like \nsomething like an Alexa but you \nabsolutely never went in that direction \nright but but I think yes I I think \nthere's something like that is coming \nand I do think that the the promise is \nthere but it's just like very very early \ndays so far \nand I think you'll probably again have a \nbetter analogy for this but like the the \niPhone app store to me it has like the \nmoat of like it's on the iPhone that's \nwhat enables all the apps really and you \nwould say maybe the language model is \nthat type of effect but then you can \ntake the API and disentangle it from the \nyou know the app the iPhone so that's \nwhere I think is a little of course you \ncould like run on Android but is that \nand then I see the other side where it's \nlike just kind of like a marketing play \nlike kind of like how you know say \nproduct hunt has like a list of products \nand so like I see it as like either just \nthe marketing like I did I know about \ncraftful because I go to the plug-in \nMarketplace and I click on the apps and \nyou know it's ranked it's high so do you \nsee those kind of things as being the \nright way of thinking about it I think \nso yeah I mean I I think that it is it \nis very possible that there isn't going \nto be another way to interact with like \napps or products or websites other than \njust going through something like chat \ngbt or or the chat GPT and interacting \nwith plugins and and that that would be \nthe app interaction \num and so in that sense it would be \nanalogous too it would be in one one \nanalogy is the App Store another analogy \nwould just be like that's the browser \num \nwhat what actually is going to be is a \nlittle bit of an up in the air right now \nI think like the the folks who are \ndeveloping in this space will all kind \nof have to be prepared for just going in \ndifferent directions and and being okay \nwith that and kind of preparing the team \nthat yes you're developing this but \nactually it may end up looking like this \nor \num you know like thinking of everything \nas \num being as much API enabled as it can \nbe because that makes it also easy to \nswitch between different Platforms in in \ndifferent kind of just like your \nspecific uis \num but yes I do think that most likely \nthere will be some sort of \num chat like chat GPT like experience \nthat we'll be interacting with and do \nyou think that the App Store is sort of \nlike probably a good good analogy to \nthat or the app store or the iPhone or \nthe browser yeah yeah brilliant I think \nthat's all a really great analysis and \nso sort of wrapping up the podcast I you \nknow personally this has really inspired \nmy interest in craft fall I'm definitely \ngonna go play with it right after this \nand you know I hope a lot of our \nlisteners are people you know building \nthings with we V8 and you know AI apps \nand could could maybe like you do the \noverview so like someone listening who's \nbuilding some kind of AI product can you \nmaybe do the introduction to craftful if \nit's not yeah so yeah so so craftful as \nI think you you summarize really well in \nthe beginning for a co-pilot for product \nmanagers and product Builders it's \nreally at this point \num the way to summarize all of the \ndifferent user feedback that you get \nfrom from from different sources so if \nyou have um user feedback in app store \nreviews but also in zendesk support \ntickets or intercom or various docs or \nCSV files that you need to summarize you \ncan then go in in summaries at all in \ncraftful but specifically with this \nproduct angle and be able to connect it \nso that we're constantly then pulling \nthat data and analyzing it and sending \nit to your mailbox so you don't have to \nworry about it and you can kind of just \ncollaborate with your team on all of the \nfeedback \nyeah and I think just the um like the \nthe the skill of how to do user \ninterviews is quite interesting like I \nyou know I did a computer science degree \nand was just hacking with like I imagine \na lot of people who listen to this \npodcast are also just like computer \nscientists and don't think about like \nhow to conduct user interviews and save \nthis kind of data so I think all that \nyeah the the angle of this this this is \none of the like skill skills workflows \ncompressed into like a charge EBT based \napp that has really captured my \nimagination more than anything else so \nalso uh kind of in the spirit of podcast \ncan you maybe tell people like how to \nkeep up with you and updates and maybe \nany announcements coming up absolutely \nyeah so probably the best the best way \nto to keep up with me is I'm very active \non Twitter I'm Jana tweets uh there \num also uh can keep up with with \ncraftful there our handle is just \ngrapple \num and that probably is the the easiest \nway to both keep up and and you know \nreach out to me and connect with me \num the the next few things we have in \nthe pipeline is just lots and lots of \nadditional features obviously you are \nusing craftful for craftful \nourselves been overwhelmed with that \nwhich is \num we do roll out new things pretty much \nevery every week and so a lot of that is \nnew Integrations new ways of analyzing \nthe data new ways of summarizing it the \njira tickets uh writing functionality \nthat kind of alluded to that's coming uh \nsoon too so lots lots and lots of \nexciting stuff \nawesome Diana thank you so much for your \nperspectives on all these things I \nlearned so much and yeah it all sounds \nso exciting \nhaving me really a fun conversation \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Yana Welinder on
