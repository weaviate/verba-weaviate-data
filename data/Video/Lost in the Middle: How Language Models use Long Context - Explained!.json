{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching this explanation of \"Lost in the Middle: How Language Models use Long Context\" ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching Wii vid on YouTube this video \nwill explore a super exciting new study \ninto retrieval augmented generation \ntitled lost in the middle how language \nmodels use long context lost in the \nmiddle is used to describe this U-shaped \ncurve where we're exploring the impact \nof search result quality on the language \nmodel's ability to reason across the \nsearch results that have been put into \nthe input so we asked a question like \nwhat is ref devec what is the atomic \nnumber of oxygen what are cross encoder \nranking models and we take that query \nand then we hit our search engine get \nsearch results and then we pass the \noriginal question plus the search \nresults to the language model so there \nthis has been something that's just \nsuper popular in application Builders \nhackers but there hasn't been too much \nexperimental findings I just you know \nthe nuances of how exactly you're going \nto append search results into the input \nlike this so this is a super exciting \npaper that has this interesting u-shaped \nfinding that is asking this question of \nwhere is the relevant information so if \nwe return you know 20 documents is the \nanswer in the first stock document the \n5th 10th 20th so on and then also what \nis the impact of how many documents \nwe're going to return to then pass the \nlanguage model you know say we give 5 10 \n20 and so on so this is a really fun \npaper to read I hope you enjoy this \npaper summary video really exciting to \nsee more research more understanding of \nretrieval augmented generation so \nquickly before diving into the \nexperiments to give a quick background \non retrieval augment to generation we \nhave questions that we want to ask a \nlanguage model like about our particular \ndata whether we have you know some kind \nof particular software we're building \nlike in the case of weviate and reftubec \nor whether it's your legal contract your \nparticular data to analyze your email so \non so we wanna instead of having the \nlanguage model just be able to answer \nquestions about our data we're going to \nretrieve from a search engine and then \nput the information into the input to \nthen help the language model region \nacross it so whereas it would say what \nis ref to vac and it says hey I have no \nidea what that is if you then give it \nthe context where you you know you've \nretrieved this text Chunk from the \nvector database and it says wevia 1.16 \nintroduced of the back module blah blah \nand then it's able to reason about what \nref to back is so this is broadly the \nsetup where we're going to retrieve \ninformation to put into the input to \nhelp answer the question so the key \nquestion the authors are exploring in \nthis paper is how does search quality \nimpact generation in this initial \nexample this is an example of the Oracle \ncontext where you have just the perfect \ncontext for answering the question what \nis ref to vac you know it gives you the \nperfect definition of it but in the real \nworld retrieval systems are a little \nmessier than this we can't guarantee \nthat the first result is going to be you \nknow the perfect answer to the question \nso the question is then like what does \nthat error how does that error then \nimpact the generation level so you know \nsay the breath say this particular \ninformation about reptavec was the third \nsearch result and the first was you know \nI don't know something about cross \nencoders the second was something about \nreplication or so on and so what is the \nimpact of the needed information not \nbeing at the first but at the third \ntenth so on and you know as you saw lost \nin the middle the more it gets to the \nmiddle the less the the language model \nis able to reason across it so then \nthere are two key experimental controls \nto study this phenomenon how many \ndocuments are retrieved in the input and \nthen where in the retrieved documents is \nthe answer so they're going to be \nfirstly they're going to control this to \nshow exactly the impact of it by using \nthe natural questions data set and more \ndetails that we'll get into but the key \nfinding being that when the you know \nwhen you have this Oracle type of thing \nwhere you have the perfect answer it's \nright there you have really high \nperformance and way better than the \nclosed book just language model \nanswering the question and this is on \npretty general questions so you know you \nimagine if it's reasoning about your \nemails or whatever obviously the closed \nbook would have no way of reasoning \nacross your \nemails or whatever so you know if it's \nin the first position we get massively \nsuccessful result but then if it's in \nthe fifth or the 10th in the case of the \ntenth it actually performs worse than \nnot having any retrieved contacts so \njust a super interesting finding odd \nthing about retrieve augments generation \nreally emphasizes the value of good \nsearch quality but let's get a little \nfurther into the experimental details \nbefore coming back into that so let's \ndive a little further into the \nexperimental setup so as you can see \nhere you know you ask a question like \nwho got the first Nobel Prize in physics \nand then you have the relevant document \nso in this case the correct answer is in \nthe second position so you see how you \nretrieve you know three documents \nanswers in a second so the first \nquestion is about how many are we going \nto be retrieving so you see the \ndifference between retrieving three \ncompared to retrieving you know five in \nthis case and then the next question is \ncontrolling where the relevant \ninformation is going to be and again I \nthink another detail about this paper \nthat I really like is that they're \nthey're controlling the experiment they \nhave the ground truth and you know it's \nnot about like just the messiness of \nreal world data although we will see \nthey did an experiment on that as well \nwhich is really interesting but you know \nthey're gonna they have the answer and \nso they're going to be controlling where \nit is one two three four so on and \nthat's how we were able to study this so \nhere's the first interesting set of \nresults we have the impact of the number \nof documents and the position of the \nanswer exploring uh six different models \nuh anthropic Cloud anthropic cloud with \n100K context gbt 3.5 turbo and then gbt \n3.5 Turbo with 16k uh input lengths the \nMPT 30 billion instruct model and \nlongchat 13 billion parameters with 16 \n000 input links so the most interesting \nthing is seeing the kind of lost in the \nmiddle thing probably in the middle you \nsee that when you only have 10 you you \nkind of see it with the five but the 20 \nreally shows it well as is a 30. so \nanyway so you see this Con this kind of \nconcept of like if the answer is the \n10th document out of 20 you get way \nworse search results compared to if it's \nlike one or two as you see towards the \nleft and I mean it's amazing to see that \nif it's one like the impact of perfect \nsearch would be just massive for \nretrieval augmented generation yeah I I \nmaybe say maybe pause this if you want \nto look through it a little further for \nme just kind of seeing the U shape and \nseeing it come from 10 20 30. so the \nnext really interesting thing explored \nis the impact of the number of documents \nso again these are you know gbt 3.5 \nTurbo with 16k input lengths Cloud 1.3 \nwith a hundred thousand input length so \nyou know these are pretty uh long \ncontext window models so you know one \nquestion would be can we just you know \ngive it a ton of search results because \nthen you know we recall at 30 becomes a \nlot easier than recall at one recall at \nfive but what they're showing is that in \nthe current state of the models you know \nthe more you give it the lower the \naccuracy and this is um averaged across \neach of the positions so you know when \nyou see this plot this point for uh 10 \nthat's the average of when the relevant \ndocument is one two three four across \nthe entire question answering data set \nyou know 30s so you get idea so the two \nkey takeaways from these experiments are \nmodel performance is highest when \nrelevant information occurs at the \nbeginning or interestingly end of its \ninput context you saw that u-shape that \ncomes back up at the end I think that's \nkind of interesting that like as it's \nattending if it's at the very end it \ngoes back up so that's just one of those \nkind of quirky things about these \nlanguage models and deep learning so \nthen the second thing is model \nperformance substantially decreases as \ninput contacts grow longer so \nyou know we're not going to kind of \nsolve this problem by you know in the \ncurrent state we're not going to solve \nthis problem by just giving it more \nsearch results and then hoping that by \nyou know increasing the window we get \nthe relevant Target that way sort of \nalso in the context of the final results \nI think it's really interesting to just \nlook at this table of the closed book \nversus the Oracle the Oracle being you \nknow the information is search result \nnumber one so this is the case where we \nhave we've solved search and we get \nperfect search results but you see this \ndifference like with the MBT 30 billion \ninstruct going from 31.5 to 81.9 or \nTurbo 56.1 to 88.3 just a huge potential \nin kind of improving search and then \nwhat that would mean for the the \nImprovement on this and it's worth \nnoting that this this data set natural \nquestions will get a little more into it \nin a second but you know this is like \ngeneral knowledge if this was about you \nknow again it maybe set it to death but \nlike your particular Discord chat or \nslack or emails or whatever then there's \nlike no chance at all at the Close book \nbut \nyou know you still could fine-tune the \nlanguage model on your information and \nthen I think you'd be in a similar kind \nof Camp as this so you know this kind of \nI think even with fine-tuning on your \ndomain you still would want this \nretrieval and then you know I mean we'll \nsee as these experiments continue to \nevolve and it's also interesting but \njust this table right here you see the \ninput the impact answering these general \nquestions the having the first search \nresult is just an enormous Improvement \nso one other interesting detail with \ntheir experimental results found in the \nappendix are some experiments with gpt4 \nso gpt4 is you know the pink one that's \nat the you know performing better than \nall these other models and you still \neven see that U-shaped curve with gbt4 \nso I think the deal I read a little bit \nabout in the appendix is that they do \nyou know you see it in the in the title \nof the plot is that they do 500 \nquestions to sample so I think it hasn't \nbeen as fully tested as the other models \nmaybe details with the API access I \nthink gbt4 is still kind of a newer \nthing at the time of recording this \nvideo so you know just you still see the \nu-shape Curve even in like the most \npowerful I you know I don't want to pick \nfavorites but I think I think gbt4 is \nwidely regarded as one of the world's \nmost powerful language models at the \ntime of this recording so as mentioned \nearlier the current results we've been \nlooking at have been in a really \ncontrolled experiment where the authors \nhave the ground truth answer and they're \nexplicitly moving it you know one two \nthree four but now let's see what this \nlooks like in a more realistic \nuncontrolled retrieval augmented \ngeneration setup so the next experiment \nis going to be using the natural \nquestions open data set which contains \nhistorical queries issued to the Google \nsearch engine and then human annotated \nanswers extracted from Wikipedia but in \nthis case instead of you know \ncontrolling the system by explicitly \nmoving where the answer is we're just \ngoing to look at what happens with the \ncontriver embeddings retrieval system so \ncontriver is one of these you know dense \nembedding models it's been fine-tuned on \nMs Marco and so we're going to be \nretrieving with that model uh to then \nyou know have the input and so it's a \nlittle more you know uncontrolled in the \nsense that you know where the correct \nanswer is could be like eight three \nseven like whatever the performance of \nthe retrieval model is so this is the \nresult that we find from that so \nI think it's important to firstly start \nwith what this uh orange curve at the \ntop is this is the recall so uh so as \nyou retrieve fifth it makes a ton of \nsense that like recall at 50 is really \nhigh you've retrieved 50 documents so \nrecall is like is the correct answer in \none of the retrieved documents or is it \nfive it looks like it's a little under \n70. so then what you're seeing \nunderneath that is the performance of \nthe models when these documents are then \ngiven as input so you see that you know \nfrom 5 10 20 the performance saturates \nit doesn't continue to improve and some \nof the models you know see like this \ndrop from 30 to 40 in the MPT and and so \non so it's a pretty it's a it's more \nmessy because it's more uncontrolled \nbecause you could have um you know \nexamples where the input or where the \nanswer just isn't in the context at all \nso that's what kind of makes it \ndifferent from the original uh \nexperiments okay so now that we've \nexplored this u-shaped impact of where \nthe relevant information is and how much \ninformation we give to the language \nmodel the authors then want to explore \nkey value retrieval to answer the \nquestion of to what extent and can \nlanguage models even retrieve from their \ninput context so what that means in this \ncase is we're going to be giving it key \nvalue pairs of randomly generated uuids \nso like if you're using weeviate you \nknow that this is the ID that you give \nto each of your data objects so you have \nthis key value and then so the task then \nbecomes key you know 9f for a so and \nthen to Output so you're trying to \nmeasure just how well it can copy what's \nin the input so similarly to the \ndocuments retrieved in question \nanswering we can also vary where the key \nvalue pair is going to be in the list \nlike say it's the sixth key value pair \nand then as well as how many key values \nthere are so you know this these are \njust showing kind of that difference \nbetween you know you have a lot of them \nor you have a few of them and then how \nyou can control where where the query is \ngoing to be and then where it is in the \ncontext so here are the results of the \nkey value experiments so shown on the \nfar left we have again this thing this \nU-shaped curve where when the key is in \nthe 25th or 50th it doesn't perform as \nwell as when it's the first key or the \nlast key kind of well the last key is a \nlittle funkier with this and also \ninterestingly though we do see that some \nof the models are really good at this \nwhereas others not as much so maybe this \nis another kind of test for you know \nwhich of these language models you're \ngoing to be using but you know we see as \nwe you know in in effort of trying to \nbreak it this model the brown one the \ngbt 3.5 turbo 16000 once we scale that \nup to 300 key value Pairs and then we \nput the key to be reasoning about in the \n200th position then we get to around 45 \nit looks like so so you know it it seems \nto do a better job at this than the than \nthe other task which is pretty \ninteresting I think being able to just \ncopy that there's a lot of like learning \nto copy with lstms and recurrent Network \nwork that kind of this these kind of \nexperiments have been you know tested \nbefore but anyway so these are the \nresults of again finding some U-shaped \ncurve in this kind of experiment as well \nto further investigate these details the \nauthors are also going to explore the \nimpact of architecture comparing decoder \nonly models with encoder decoder \nexperiments with query aware \ncontextualization and the effective \ninstruction tuning so to start off with \nencoder decoder versus decoder only an \nencoder decoder Transformers you first \nencode all the input into a vector and \nthen you would put that Vector into the \ndecoder that then attends over that \nVector encoded by the encoder so it \nmakes sense to hypothesize that you know \nwhen you're encoding everything into a \nvector maybe it has the you know the con \nthe context of looking at the entire \nretrieve search results and that way \nit's able to see that even if it's in \nthe 10th position you know as we've been \nseeing with this U-shaped curve it can \nstill attend over when it's decoding \nonly but so they're going to compare the \nflan T5 XXL model with the flan ul2 I'm \nnot super familiar with these models I \nput a little bit with the flan T5 series \nwhen we were you know looking at you \nknow this before the like the chat gbt \nthing came out we were exploring these \nkind of models pretty heavily but so \nanyway so the interesting thing here is \num you know they don't really find that \nthis encoder decoder decoder only thing \nimpacts that too much but another really \ninteresting nugget that I think is \nreally interesting for prompt design is \nthis query aware contextualization so \nwhen you're decoding only the model only \nlooks into sorry only looks at the past \nif it doesn't like attend to the Future \ntokens so if you're saying you know \nplease answer this question based on the \ncontext and then you don't give it the \nquestion yet then it's just kind of like \nforming this representation of what it's \nlooking at without any without the \nquestion to actually like help kind of \nguide its reasoning through the search \nresults so they're showing that a pretty \nbig Improvement by just putting the \nquestion in the beginning of the decoder \nonly models \nso that way it can you know look at what \nis reasoning about as it's building up \nthe representation so I like this quote \nparticularly with that key value \nexperiment gbt 3.5 Turbo with the 16k \ninputs with query aware \ncontextualization achieves perfect \nperformance when evaluated with 300 key \nvalue pairs in contrast without it it \nachieves the lowest performance of 45.6 \nso the difference between you know what \nis the value of the key and then that \nkey like 9f 4A B2 if you remember that \nthe difference between giving that \nbefore you then show the key values \ncompared to you see the key values and \nthen you ask this question like that \nkind of thing so I think that's pretty \ninteresting for the prompt design for \nretrieval augments generation so the \nnext thing is this really interesting \nthing of \ntrying to highlight maybe the bias of \ninstruction tuning so you know thinking \nthat with instruction tuning that you \nknow maybe it's bias towards the answer \nbeing right there because that's kind of \nhow the instruction tuning might look \nlike so they compare the MPT 30 billion \nthe language model with the instruction \nfine-tune checkpoint so I think there \nwas a lot of confounding here because \nthe language model is uh you know not as \ntuned as the instruction models \ngenerally are and that's why I think you \nsee the accuracy is so much lower with \nthe just the pure language model but I \nthink what is really interesting is \nyou're seeing the impact of Mosaic ml \nopen sourcing the language model as well \nas the instruction tune this is one such \nexperiment I think there are so many \nexperiments that we can do by exploring \nthe different fine-tuning routes from \nthat MPT 30 billion base model so I I \ndidn't really take anything away \npersonally from this but I just I love \nseeing this kind of like MPT 30 billion \nversus the instruction checkpoint and \nhow that's been open source I I think \nthat's all super interesting so finally \none last thing the authors present is \nthe c real position effect the U-shaped \ncurve we observe in this work has a \nconnection in Psychology known as the \nserial position effect that states that \nin free association recall of elements \nfrom a list humans tend to best remember \nthe first and last elements of the list \nso you know maybe that there's something \nto that \ncomparing how language models recall \nthings as well as how humans do so to \nconclude here are some of my Reflections \nfrom reading this paper lost in the \nmiddle how language models use long \ncontext the first of which is the \nimportance of search so kind of you know \nbefore The Branding of vector databases \nthis was referred as a vector search \nengines or vector search databases this \nkind of looking into information \nretrieval literature following along \nwith you know what search practitioners \nare doing and the practices behind \nsearch has always been core to wevia and \njust as an example we get 120 the latest \nrelease at the time of recording this \npodcast uh sorry video introduces cross \nencoder re-rankers Auto cut and new \nhybrid search rank Fusion now you've \nseen like the you know how you can \ncombine bm25 with Vector search and \nleviate so search has always been first \nclass Citizen and we V8 alongside that \nVector index and the database scaling \nand all that kind of stuff so \nquickly let me take you through these \nthree new the three like latest features \njust to show you a little further how we \nV8 helps you get that better search that \navoids that u-shape and hopefully gets \nyou that Oracle context so here we are \nin the weeviate documentation to look at \nAuto cut re-rankers and new hybrid rank \nFusion so I think autocut is probably \nthe most interesting one for this paper \nwe've seen this other paper called uh \nlarge language models are easily \ndistracted by irrelevant context and \nthat's all kind of motivated you know \neven just human Searchers want this kind \nof thing where basically the idea is if \nwe see a jump in Vector distance so we \nsearch something like what is reftubec \nand the first text Chunk has the vector \ndistance \n0.1899 then 0.1901 0.191 and then we \nhave a jump 0.21 autocut is a new \nfeature in weeviate that's going to look \nat these uh slopes and so cut it that \nway so you know it interpolates a line \nbetween the vector distances if you you \nknow plot them on an axis of just X \nbeing where the search result is and \nthen y being the distance you \ninterpolate that line and you look for \nvery steep slope changes in the distance \nand so you'll cut that kind of thing so \nwhen you're searching weevier you have \nnear text Concepts you know this animals \nand movies that was turned into a vector \nand then if you pass in Auto cut one \nthat means the first steep jump detected \nit will cut the search results and this \nis a great way to only pass in the top \nthree results the language models \nprobably the best solution for \nyou know this kind of uh the findings \nbehind lost in the middle so another \ninteresting thing then is um you know \nre-ranking search results so we also \nhave the re-ranker modules that were \nintroduced in uh 1.20 so we have re-rank \nour cohere as well as re-rank our \nTransformers so re-rank our Transformers \nbetter for say local development you \nknow uh the hugging face sentence \nTransformer libraries they've open \nsourced cross encoder models cross \nencoder models sorry to set the stage a \nlittle more they take as input the query \nand then each candidate document so say \nyou have five you know five potential \nsearch results it would take the query \nand then that first result the query and \nthat second result and then output a \nhigher capacity score so you're trading \noff speed for a more accurate ranking \nand as we've seen with lost in the \nmiddle that more accurate ranking could \nend up being super impactful for \nretrieval augmented generation so with \nweavate 1.20 we have you know two ways \nof doing this you can either use the \nlocal sentence Transformers or you can \nget an API key and use the cohere model \nso cohere their you know off offering \ncross encoder ranking models as a \nservice as an API so \nyou know just really interesting stuff \nfor the you know search quality and so \nfinally with hybrid search you know we \nV8 has bm25 built in and Vector search \nso you can combine the uh the scorings \nof documents of these two algorithms and \nso when we first released this we just \nhad rank Fusion where you're just \nlooking like you know it's okay it's \nranked third in the bm25 and it's ranked \nsecond in Vector search so just combine \nit based score it based on the ranks \nwhereas now we have an actual uh score \nFusion so score Fusion you're like \nlooking at the particular score that \ncame out of bm25 or similarly to autocut \nyou're looking at that like distance \nthat came out of the vector search so \nyou know more ways of how we combine \nthese results and overall deliver that \nyou know hopefully that Oracle uh search \ncontext the second key takeaway for me \nis I want to see this testing other \nkinds of context so right now what we \nsaw is this setup where you know k out \nof the end results are relevant but I \nthink in this whole you know argument of \nhow do large language models use long \ncontext I I've been just super inspired \nby the Llama index idea where you're \nretrieving from different indexes so you \nknow in we V8 we separate data objects \nkind of like categories of objects into \nclasses so you have blog posts podcast \ntranscriptions a code repository or like \nWikipedia so I think the interesting \nthing in Long context is to retrieve \nfrom each of these sources so you know \nagain I ask you what is reftubec you \nmight want to retrieve Snippets from \nblog posts you know Wikipedia entry or \nlike say a knowledge graph that has like \nyou know these tuples to give \ninformation about reftubec as well as \npodcast transcripts like how is reftubec \nused in conversation and then maybe like \ncode Snippets of seeing it in action in \nsome way but this idea of retrieving \nfrom different sources I think that's \nalso a huge part of this conversation \nand not just you know only k out of the \nend results are relevant but you know of \ncourse that's a huge part of it and then \nyou have the compounding effective as \nyou retrieve from these other things \nthere could be irrelevant things as well \nand that's why I think this whole \nre-rankers autocut hybrid brand Fusion \nit's also exciting of trying to you know \nretrieve from all these sources and make \nsure that you get that number one result \nis a good result so then finally \nyou know I think a lot of these you know \nwe have these extractive question \nanswering where you're you what is the \natomic number of oxygen eight and I \nthink generally it'll be more \ninteresting to explore the impact of you \nknow where the relevant information is \nhow much is retrieved in abstractive or \nyou know summarization where you have to \nwrite these like long responses to \nbizarre questions that you can't just \nkind of like give a factual answer \nquickly too so it makes the controlling \nof the experiment much more difficult \nbut you know it's just kind of the \nevolution of this space you know \nevaluating \nGenerations broadly is quite difficult \nbut I think you know it just that is \nwhat I would predict is the evolution of \nthese kind of experiments thank you so \nmuch for watching this video explanation \nof Lost in the middle how large language \nmodels use long context I thought this \nwas such an interesting paper so cool to \nsee these experimental findings on the \nimpact of where the relevant information \nis in the retrieval augmented generation \nsetup as well as how many documents are \ngoing to be then handed to the language \nmodel I love seeing the key value \nretrieval the expiration across \ndifferent models from the gbt models the \ncloud models you know MPT and longchat \nit was overall just a really cool paper \nto read so if you enjoy these paper \nsummary videos please subscribe to \nweviate
