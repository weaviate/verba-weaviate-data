{"text": "This video shows how to use the Weaviate python client. A simple example dataset of ABC News Headlines is used. The video ... \nhello welcome to this um \npresentation of the vva python client \nand \nyeah i'm set out here to um just give a \nlittle bit of an introduction into the \nclient and also \nto show how a vba project how is such a \nsemantic analysis or \nyeah some some kind of interesting \nproject using vvate \ncould start out in a python environment \nand \nobviously we have to start with getting \nsome data in so i \nchose this data set here a million news \nheadlines \none reason is that it's very simple so \nyou're going to be able to follow along \nvery easily and it is also not \num from the sheer size of it not too big \nso we're not going to sit here forever \num and it's uh yeah \nso obviously in a production environment \nwe could just scale up vv8 and \nget also much much more data in but in a \nlocal environment i think this is a \nnice starting data set \nso yeah let's get right into it the \nfirst thing we want to have is \nobviously we would need to import vv8 we \ncan just pip \ninstall it with a vv8 client \nand then we need to get the data in and \nlet's have a look at this data frame \nand we see right away we have two \ncolumns \none is really just a news headline \nand one is a publish date so \nwhen we think about the semantic \ncontext of a news headline uh there \nthere is actually a little bit of a \nproblem depending on how the newspaper \nworks \nthe headline itself might not really \nindicate \nwhat the article itself is really about \nso \num in a more yeah \nmore serious attempt to maybe get \ninformation out of news sites or news \narticles \nwe probably want to add much more than \njust the headline to \nbuild a bigger context and get much much \nmore concrete \ninformation and just help to build a \nway bigger context so the more data the \nbetter \nusually all right but this out of the \nway let's just \nget in so the first thing we want to \nhave is obviously we need a client \nso we're just going to use so we have \nvv8 imported here so \nwe can use it \nand get a client object \nclient so \nand i have this running on the local \nhost \nand just to see what's running here \nwe gonna get the meter in point \nand as you can see i run 22.19 at the \nmoment \nand i'm running on this contentionary \nenglish contentionary \nso i'm running the most current version \nthat is currently out there \nat the time i'm recording this \nand yeah so now we have a pipe \na client object and the client object is \nactually \ncreated in a way where you can \nfind all the um yeah \napi groups directly under it so \nfor example with a schema we have query \nvery things like batching and \nclassification and obviously the data \nobjects to just add and \nremove things so \nthe ide that is a little bit \nhelping you with uh showing you \nvarious functions that are available you \nshould be \nvery very quickly get into it or \notherwise you can obviously check out \nour \ndocumentation it's very elaborate on how \nthe client works \nall right the next thing we need is a \nschema \nand yeah i created a small schema here \num let's have a look at this it \nactually just creates one class \nand i call this news for for the moment \nit doesn't really matter \nand then we have \none property text with the headline \nand the headline is obviously very \nimportant for us at this in this \nexample because we have um it the \nheadline itself gives the \nuh context of the entire class and \nbecause it's the only \nreal text value and then we have \num a year and a month so we see here the \ndate which is \num yeah this uh number \num it's formatted as a as an integer \nso we're gonna split this up in \nin in the year in the month and \nwhen we have this stick created so we \ncan just use a \nnative python dict because it's so \ncompatible to \nto the json format it shouldn't be a big \nproblem \nto use this and then we can go with \nclient \ndot shima dot create \nand then add the schema and \nthere we go so we have loaded the schema \nand yeah now the next thing is we want \nto get some data in so we want to get \nthis data frame just that we don't have \nto scroll all the time let's just open \nit here again \nso we want to have the headlines in \nthere and we want to split \nthis date up into the year and the month \nso yeah i'm gonna use batching for this \nbecause \nwe just want to speed up the loading \nprocess so \nlet's create a batch and \nfor the batching we have this special \nbatching object that just collects \nsingle things and then we can commit \nthis in in one go \nto vb8 and load everything in one go so \nthat's um a things batch request \nlet's create another object of this and \nthen let's say we \nhave a batch size \nof maybe a thousand so \nthis is a little bit depending on how \nbig your objects are actually are \nand and since i'm on a local machine \ni can choose a very big batch size and \nif you \nchoose a two big batch size in a in a \nmore productive environment you might \nwanna \nuh you might run into timeouts or \nsomething like this then you can either \nadjust the timeout settings or you have \nto reduce your pet size a little bit \nso or you horizontally scale \nand just make smaller batch sizes and \nhorizontally scale it out something like \nthis \nall right and then the next thing we \nwant to do is we want to go over each of \nthese \nrows and create um an object for that \nright so \nlet's just go for index and row \nin data frame dot eater \nrows \nand then we go we we gonna create a \ndictionary that represents this object \nso \nit's gonna need like a headline a year \nand a month all right \nand we call that news \nso headline \nand we can actually just um \nget actually this headline \nand yeah for the year and a month i'm \ngonna just copy this in now because it \nit's not too interesting when i'm typing \nso what i'm gonna do here is just i \nuse the publish date and then i'm gonna \nuse the first \nfour digits for the year and then \nlike the middle two here um \nfor the month all right and then we have \na new stick so this is our \nthing that we want to add and then we \nhave to add it to the batch so \nlet's add thing and then \nwe're gonna take the news \ndict and also \num say the class so this is just here we \ncall this class news so \ni'm gonna also say that this is of type \nclass news right \nall right and that's basically it now we \njust have to commit the batch every once \nin a while \nso let's go ahead and say the patch size \nof every 1 000 batches uh every 1000 \nthings \ni mean we're gonna \nprint the index and then we're gonna \nclient dot \nbatch dot create \nthings and then \nalso add our patch and \nyeah then we're gonna create a new batch \nbecause \notherwise we're gonna just append on the \nsame page over and over again and that's \nobviously not what we want we want to \nhave a new batch \nand then also when this is because we \nare not finishing on a perfect \nuh part of 1000 so let's just \nrun this commit message again \nyeah and that should do it let's run \nthis and we see it's loading \nand the loading is going to take a while \nso \ni'm just gonna jump ahead \nand see you in a few seconds when this \nis loaded \nalright so we are back now and \neverything is loaded \nand yeah so we see here the output of \nthe last batch actually \njust a quick note on this obviously \nthere is much more to this function so \na lot of these client functions they \nhave optional properties that \ntry to set sensible default values but \nobviously you can \ncustomize all kind of things and also we \ndon't do a lot of \nactually we don't do any error \nmanagement here or checking of the if \nthe \nloading was actually successful we just \nassumed that and it's also pretty safe \nto assume since the \ndata set is very yeah \nlimited and also our schema and \neverything is very limited so there is \nnot a lot of space for error \nbut yeah obviously you could in a in a \nmore productive environment you want to \nwant to check if everything \nwas successful as you assumed so now \nlet's have a look at \num what we want to do next so we want to \ngo \nand query this data and here we have uh \nthe query we're going to use so actually \nwe're going to \nsay all right we um want to have this \nour things we just loaded and \nwe want to be able to filter them based \non \nyear and month so we want to have a \nmonthly base \nand yeah we gonna \nalso do an explore search so so to find \nthe \nclosest things that are um \nconnected to this concept so i chose the \nconcept dancing here and we see \num on the right that we actually get \nsomething about ballet \nballet and uh dance production but we \nalso see already a problem with our data \nset so \nfor example it seems that this one \nheadline here is loaded twice \nso um there might need to be a little \nbit so we work a little bit with dirty \ndata here that \nmight need some cleaning up actually \nall right and also with the data set \nlet's let's say um this is a little bit \ncherry picked here we see there is \nactually something connected to dance \nbut if we let's look at the next month \nso \nwe see there is no real connection to \nthen so it's choosing something that is \nstill connected to dancing as a concept \nso something like arts or music \num are still pretty close to dancing but \nobviously those are not things that are \ndirectly \nover um dancing itself so um \nyeah we we see that the confidence \nor certainty in this this case also \ngoes down um to reflect that these \nuh things are not con that deeply \nconnected to our concept \nall right so how can we get this \nquery in here so \nto create the wear and explore filter we \njust gonna \ntranslate these filters directly into a \npython dict \nso we're gonna say operator this is just \nbecoming a string and it's becoming a \nstring this is \nstaying a list of strings and so we can \nbasically want to one translate that \ninto a python filter \nuh a python dict and yeah how this is \ngonna look like it's just \nlet me copy this in here so \nthis is just really one to one these two \nfilters \nand then i'm gonna package those into a \nnice function \nand that is gonna allow us to search for \na concept based on the year and the \nmonth \nand now we're gonna connect these \num actually we're gonna build this \nentire query here \nusing a query builder so we're gonna go \nwith the client again \nand query and then we gonna get \nthings \nand here we wanna have the news class \nand we gonna say so \nlet's have a look in into this again so \nget things \nnews class and then we're gonna state \nwhat we want to have here so here we \nhave everything year month headline and \nthis underscore property certainty but \nfor our python code here we got just \ngoing to be interested in the certainty \nand then we say we want to have this \nwith an explorer \nand we're gonna add our explore filter \ndict and then we also want to have a \nwith where \nand we're gonna add the where filter and \nwe're gonna also \nsay limit this to the top 100 \num results and then we're gonna \nexecute with do and since this is a \nfunction \nwe wanna turn uh \nreturn this entire thing that is coming \nfrom this query all right \nlet's uh just try this out \nexplore headlines \nlet's stay with them thing \nthen \nand 2008 we had \nand march \nand then we see this is how a result \nlooked like so \nwe have this um \njson level here and data get \nthings news and then we just have a long \nlist of results \nwith the certainty so \nand then i created a small \nfunction that is using this long list \nhere \nand creates an average of it so let's \nremove this and \npaste this function in so we have get \naverage certainty \nwhich calls our just created query \nand yeah we just gonna \nsum this up and then return \nthe average all right \nand in the next step we're gonna \ndo this for all the years and months in \nthis data set so we're gonna go \nthrough the years and through the month \nand then you get the average certainty \nand we just gonna put this into a new \npython \num pandas data frame \nso that we can easily explore it and \nplot it so yeah the \num i use this \nconcept here global finance crisis banks \nreal estate \nit doesn't really matter how the words \nare ordered \nit's just about the concept they create \nthe kind of space they create \nand yeah then we can have a \nlook at this data frame and we see then \nwe have now for every month so \nbecause we convert here the date into uh \nthis pandas date it says just as the \nfirst of every \nmonth but we know it's an aggregation of \nthe entire month \nso and then we have the average \ndistances \num to the concept to this concept here \nall right and if we now plot this \nthen hopefully we see that there is \nactually quite a spike \nin uh yeah 2007 2008 \nwhere this is the headlines are much \nmore \nconnected to um yeah this kind of \nconcept \nobviously because there was the global \nfinancial crisis \nbased on real estate speculations \nand yeah but we see still quite some \nproblems here so for example this is \nquite noisy \nwe also see that there are two uh \nkind of low peaks and um i investigated \nthis \na little bit in beforehand so for \nexample what happens here \non these two peaks uh is that those \nparticular month have much less data \nthan uh the other months so \nin this case uh what happens here is \nmaybe there is just \nless news articles so it's not really \nabout \nsince we create an average we would \nstill um \nshould still get kind of dissimilar but \nmaybe just the the \neconomic section is missing right so if \nthe economic section \nheadlines is missing completely then we \njust get things that are kind of \nconnected to \ni don't know maybe uh maybe crisis or \nbanks as it can be any anything in any \nuh other um yeah \nsection and then we get these kind of uh \nproblems so we see that data set is \nmaybe not \nideal for this kind of analysis so we \nwould have to clean this up a little bit \nfind out what what the problems are here \nand then \nwhen we have like a very nice noisy area \nhere \ni would say this is probably because we \njust use headlines our context is made \nout \nby very small settings and as i said \nbefore let's \nlet's imagine somebody is speaking here \nactually about the crisis but the \nheadline is something like \nhow we gonna go forward from this or um \nthe unexpected winners of our current \nsituation \nthis kind of headlines don't really \nsay anything about the text \nabout the the article itself even though \nfor the people at that time \nit might have made sense because it was \nin the context of the time \nbut yeah for us it would be very helpful \nif we would have really the entire text \nbut then this \ndata loading and the example would be a \nlittle bit more elaborate also the \nschema gets more complicated \nso i just wanted to have this small um \nthing to get started and i hope this \nshows you how quickly you actually can \nget to kind of a graph to to get an \nexploration of your \nuh data and to see that actually the \nclient is very very straightforward so \njust uh \nusing the api groups just uh yeah \nusing it how how you would uh in native \npython \npython so i hope that you \nenjoyed this and i hope you give vv8 a \ntry in the python client \nand i'm really interested for your \nfeedback so \nleave a github issue or \njoin our community slack or \njust write something on stack overflow \nwe are very active on all these \nthings so um yeah thank you for watching \nand see you soon \n", "type": "Video", "name":
