{"text": "Hey everyone, thank you so much for watching the 51st episode of the Weaviate Podcast with Greg Kamradt and Colin Harmon! \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching the wevia podcast I'm super \nsuper excited about this podcast we have \nGreg kamrat and Colin Harman these two \nare both uh prolific entrepreneurs in \nthe space of llm Agents uh Greg has made \nall sorts of amazing content about Lang \nchain and different examples of uh prom \nsays AI early signal series and uh Colin \nhas given this really impressive lecture \non hallucinations and how that is \nmanifested in agents and how to fix it \nat the haystack conference so I thought \nit would be so exciting to bring these \ntwo together and just hash out \neverything with our current \nunderstanding of Agents laying chain \nllama index and just how this whole \nSpace is evolving uh so firstly guys \nthank you so much for joining the \npodcast \nabsolutely thanks for having us \nhappy to be here \nawesome so could we do a round of intros \nuh Greg can you tell us about like how \nyou came to be working in this space \nyeah absolutely so my background is \nactually on the B2B products side of the \nhouse so I used to run a growth team \nover at Salesforce for sales and service \ncloud and then I was the first \noperations hire at digits which is a \nseries C fintech company and I have a \nhistory of teaching people how to do \ndata analysis and build data products \nbut this year my focus has been teaching \npeople how to use AI tools to build AI \nproducts and it's just a fascinating \nspace right now because not only is the \napplications evolving but even the tools \nare evolving themselves and so it's \nreally a turbulent time which is fun to \nbe in \nyeah amazing I think um I can't speak to \nenough of how much your videos have \nhelped me understand Lang chain and it's \nvery cool hearing the Salesforce \nbackground because that that uh write \n100 sales emails with the Y combinator \nvideo you did I can't wait to dive into \nthat because I think that's such an \ninteresting topic with how this like you \nknow personalized retrieval augmented \ngeneration can impact that kind of thing \num so before we dive into it any further \nColin could you also kind of tell the \nstory of like how you can be working in \nthis space \nyeah absolutely so a few years ago I was \nworking as a machine learning engineer \nand um \nhad some exposure to natural language \nprocessing and kind of decided to go all \nin on that and that was it turns out a \npretty good time to make that decision \num and then you know my in my current \nrole I'm the head of Technology at Nash \nwhich builds uh Enterprise search and \nautomation applications for heavy \nIndustries so upon starting there also \ngot really into the information \nretrieval side of things and \num as both of you know both of those \nConcepts have kind of exploded in the \npast year two years so it's been a great \ntime to be in that area and and you know \nfollowing content like \num Connors and Greg's has been super \nhelpful and um it's very important so uh \nyeah that's how I ended up here and and \nnow just trying to you know find the \nfuture of how do you put these things \ninto products and and understand it \nproperly yeah fascinating I think maybe \nalso to kick things off if we could do a \nround of just like how are we each \nthinking about \nlike Lang chain llama index Chad gbt \nMarketplace just generally the space of \nlike large language models using tools \nthis General concept of agency like like \nhow how would you define it to someone \num yeah I'll get i'll get started with \nthat but really I think my my opinion on \nit is a little \num \nmaybe a little more old school basically \num I I've been asking myself this \nquestion okay we're talking about AI a \nlot right and a year ago what did an AI \nteam do and what what did you need to \nprovide value with AI and the answer to \nthat was basically you needed a \nsignificant amount of talent you needed \na significant amount of data and you \nneeded in many cases a lot of compute \nresources as well right so that's what \nAI was \num however not with language models if \nyou want to be AI you want to do \nlanguage models you don't need any of \nthose things right thanks to people like \nyou guys anyone can figure out how to \nuse these and you don't need compute to \ndo it you can use it like a software \ntool so I'm thinking of language models \nnow as a type of software just another \nBlock in the software stack this is not \nAI it doesn't require special talent \ndoesn't require special data right \nbecause the data comes with the tool \num so broadly I think of of Agents as a \ntype of \napplication that uses language models \nright and I think I think you're \nstarting to see some hints of that from \nentities like Microsoft talking about \nthings in that way as well this is just \nthe new normal and it's going to be part \nof you know every not every system but a \nlarge large proportion of systems out \nthere so um agents in particular if I \nwere to make that more specific I'd say \nagents are aspects of those applications \nthat choose and use \nvarious subsystems so I'll leave it at \nthat and we can iterate on it a bit \nyeah and then just to join in on there I \n100 agree I think that we're seeing a \npattern here where you see an early \niteration of a tool that's just clearly \ngoing to be what the future is going to \nlook like now the the other side of that \ncoin is that the reliability piece and \nso you're seeing things like the baby \nAGI and the auto GPT \nis it a question that they're going to \nbe that's going to be the model for the \nfuture without a doubt it won't be the \nexact same thing but that sort of \nframework is going to be prevalent for \nsure we aren't quite there yet because \nwe're solving a whole bunch of other \nproblems that come with it but \num I am all in on agents I'm a Believer \ncount me in for it \nyeah I think those are both great uh you \nknow great overviews from just the \nconcept of just large language models \nbeing just like a compute primitive this \nkind of like person in the computer that \nyou can just put in any intermediate \nlayer of some you know transformation of \ndata across an API or doing different \nkinds of skills that you can compress \ninto natural language um so I you know \nin preparing for this podcast I took a \nlook at blank chains documentation to \nsee like what's the newest you know \npresentation of the ideas and so \nHarrison the latest abstraction is \nthinking that large language models can \nbe based around you know data aware \nlarge language models and then agent uh \na gen agent center there's some kind of \nlike agent agentic I've never seen that \nword before like agent icy but so I say \nthese two things as like \nyou know you connect to the data like in \na vector database and that's where you \nknow our interests around this really \ncomes and then also connecting with the \napis so I guess kind of I want to start \noff by diving into the data aware llms \nand sort of what you guys are seeing \nwith you know I know Colin has done a \nlot of work on hallucinations and you \nknow Greg has tons of videos on \ningesting particular kind of data into \nsomething like a vector database so that \nyou can then retrieve the context and \nfacilitate the generation so how you \nguys currently think about this kind of \nlike making large language models \ncustomized to your data through the use \nof like you know connecting it to \ndatabases \nyeah I'll jump in quickly on that one my \nview on it is it's a very romantic idea \nto think that a language model can do \nanything that you want it to right and \nit communicates and the story tells very \nwell that you can throw whatever command \nat it whatever data at it and it's just \ngoing to magically return things back to \nyou but I think what we're seeing here \nis that language models are really good \nat some sort of tasks they're not \nwonderful at all tasks and that's okay \nbecause we don't want to over overload \nthe system with too many um too many \ndifferent types of requests and an \nexample of that is where you see people \nsay hey language model please think out \nloud first and then answer my question \nas opposed to just hey go answer my \nquestion for that so when it comes to \nadding data to the context of your \nlanguage model I see too many folks try \nto throw the kitchen sink and just throw \nevery single thing that they can on \nthere where I think in reality you can \nget a really long way with better \nprompting and more signal to noise ratio \nwithin the context that you're passing \nin the first place which just speaks to \nthe programmatic ability to do really \nawesome retrieval in the first place as \nopposed to giving everything to the \nlanguage model \nyeah and I think a lot of it is about \njust how many places in kind of a search \npipeline you can inject a large language \nmodel so from data ingestion using the \nlarge language model to kind of extract \nand format the data for the schema say \nyou have like this High H lowercase y \ncapital D capital E is like this idea of \nwhere you you take a query and you have \nthe large language model generate a \npotential document and you search with \nthat document or say using the large \nlanguage model to cut the search results \nsay type 10 results passive language \nmodel language what else has only give \nthese two to the next step in the chain \nor say the large language model re-ranks \nit it's like there's so many places to \nput the large language model in this \nkind of retrieval Pipeline and get \nbetter search results but I think a \ngreat topic Colin would be talking about \nthis hallucination problem how like \nwhere are we at with hallucination and \nfixing it with the kind of retrieval \nyeah \num I thought Greg brought up a great \npoint right asking the language model to \ndo the wrong task and that I would say \nis is one of the big problems here I was \njust talking to a client today about \nabout you know how you can do better on \nmath problems when you use you know true \nthought chain of threat prompting \nsystems \num but why would you want to \nsolve a math problem probabilistically \nbecause you know these models have a \ncertain error rate on these math \nproblems when we know how to solve math \nproblems right we we've figured that out \nthat came with when computers were \ninvented right so um there's there's a \nbig question of don't solve the wrong \nproblem or don't solve a problem with \nthe wrong tool \npick the right tool for the problem and \num and then getting back to okay like \nhow do you use these language models and \napplications really step one for 95 of \napplications is going to be connect this \nto your proprietary data or whatever \ndata you're trying to attend your \napplication over so retrieval \nnecessarily is the most important part \nof any of these Real World Language \nmodel applications just because \num look at any software application \nright those are based on data as well \nsoftware applications use databases they \nuse search \num so the same thing needs to happen \nwith uh with language models because if \nyou don't do that that's not a truly \nuseful product it's like a demo right or \nyou can do it in chat GPT so for most \npeople building building businesses you \nneed to build something better than what \nyou can do in chat GPT and the easiest \nand most straightforward way to do that \nis connect to the important data and \nthat yeah that can be that could be a \nvector index a Keyword Index like bm25 \nit could also be managed index like Bing \nsearch API or it could be \num it could be a structured database \nwhich I know Connor you're you're into \nthe the querying using language models \nthing and we've been doing that for a \nwhile now too and every single one of \nthose can be optimized using language \nmodels throughout the process so so yeah \nyou have this concept of okay retrieve \nand then generate but generate can also \nbleed into that retrieve step and it \ndoesn't have to be a one directional \nprocess right you can go back and forth \nso there's a lot of ways to improve it \nbut it's most basic you need to retrieve \nif you want to deliver business value \nyeah I I love that not a one directional \nthing I mean as you mentioned like yeah \nI love that um like I think now llama \nindex and Langston are both calling it \nThe self querying retriever where you \nask it you know like uh What uh uh like \nhow long do golden doodles live on \naverage as a dark question think about \nthe mortality of gold noodles but like \nand then you you would give it like the \nyou know symbolic schema that you like \nyou know Vector databases like weaviate \nin addition to storing your unstructured \ntext chunks you also usually have some \nsymbolic data around the text chunks and \nwe integrate that kind of stuff into the \nvector index so you have filtered search \nbut so you so you know you give it the \nproperties in the prompt and it might \nsay you know where animal equals dog and \nthen you know you have the symbolic \nfilter so there's like that notion to it \nwhere you can just use more of the \nlevers to the search engine it kind of \nis like with web GPT you have these \nsearch actions like you know do you want \nto scroll to the next page of the Bing \nsearch results and and this kind of \nthing and you know but so there's like \nthat there's like using the llm to \ncontrol all the levers of the vector \ndatabase but I also really love this \nconcept of um you know like an interface \nand this is kind of how I see client \nFrameworks even like stepping like into \nthe software hat of like you know \ndatabase client Frameworks like I see \nsomething like Lang chain llama indexes \norchestrating like Eva and like say \nneo4j and then like an SQL system and \nlike using the unique \nbenefits of combining your data in each \nof these ways another kind of \nreally interesting area of retrieval \nfrom different kinds of information \nsources but I think it would be a great \ntransition into this kind of tool use \nnow because we've already kind of \ntransitioned from retrieval and we're \nnow kind of making it more like a tool \nlike \nyou know I'm really curious about like \nhow you guys are seeing things like you \nknow zapier I know Greg has opinions on \nzapier and like using the calendar apis \nand like how to how does the tool use \nkind of come into this picture \nyeah quicker than that one I think just \nhow I'm confident in that agent Paradigm \nwill obviously be what's happening in \nthe Future tools are the the other side \nof the coin that come with it I mean \nthat's how you get them to interact with \nour lives I just saw this quote within \nthe human Loop blog post that said uh \nSam Altman suggested that a lot of \npeople thought they wanted apps to be \ninside of chat gbt so they thought they \nwanted plugins in chat GPT but in \nreality what they really wanted was chat \nGPT in their apps \nso it's not chat gbt as the central \npoint we're going to interact with all \nyour tools it's rather because really \nwhat's the incentive for the third party \napplications to support that heavily \nright they what they want is they want \nthe users in their app and they want the \nchat gbt like abilities within their own \napp in the first place so as we think \nabout tools I think it's going to be a \nreally interesting dynamic between \nwhat's best for the user and what's best \nfor the business because unfortunate not \nunfortunately but the way that market \ndynamics usually work is what's best for \nthe business is what's going to come out \nin the very first place now open source \nsoftware will of course help out the \nuser and go from there but \num I think this is a dynamic we still \ndon't know how it's going to play out \nquite yet \nit's so fascinating you brought that up \nlike we did podcast fans stay tuned for \nuh a deep dive on Chad gbt marketplace \nwith Yana wellender who's building \ncraftful so craftful with a K is um you \nknow it's like a product manager inside \nof chat gbt sort of so what the product \nis is it's like prompts that product \nmanagers use like for analyzing customer \nfeedback or like you know suggestions \nfor what you do so it's kind of like \nskill based prompting like I think \nsummarization has been one of the big \nlikes the most successful skill to \nprompt it with like create and refine \nmapreduce like how you summarize with a \nskill and so so on this chat gbt \nMarketplace thing oh man I think this is \nso interesting and especially like you \nknow Greg's such a prolific content \ncreator I think this applies to you so \ninterestingly is like and yeah like \neveryone really but like imagine like \ntaking all your expertise on how to use \nLang chain and like kind of setting up \nlike instead of like a course you would \ncreate now you create like a set of \nprompts and it's like a product on the \nchat gbt Marketplace and coming back to \nthat market dynamics thing and like the \nbusiness around it it's like \nit's like yes I want the users in my app \nbut the exposure of the App Store might \nbe so much like you know kind of it's \npretty fascinating I don't know what do \nyou think about that kind of \noh I mean you you've kind of it's such \nan interesting topic to me the \ndifference between Chad gbt Marketplace \nversus just the API but I think the \nmarketplace offers a lot of marketing \nyeah I'd say another part of it really \nlike maybe what goes under that that Sam \nAltman quote is that the llm is a \nfeature now of a different product right \nand a lot of people are still thinking \nof it as a product but now it's just a \nfeature right it's just software so you \nhave a lot of people working on projects \nthat are okay like there's some tool I \nuse some software tool I use well I'm \ngoing to make a startup to do that with \nan llm well that's just going to be a \nfeature in the incumbent in one to two \nmonths guaranteed unless you're talking \nabout a really really slow \num \nincumbent so these llms it's just going \nto be a feature it's going to make its \nway into everything it's because it's \nsoftware now right you don't need to \nhire an AI team there's no barrier to \nentry \num and I think there will still be \nbenefit from having you know possibly a \napp in the in the Chachi PT Marketplace \nbut \num truly most of the the really valuable \nproducts are things that aren't going to \njust work in the chat GPT Marketplace \nbecause how many apps can you truly make \nhow many \num how much value can you truly provide \nwith like a one-to-one okay you know \nquery or you know \num chat chat entry and then \ncomputation like that is very limited \nand there's more benefit coming from \nintegrating that into a different \nplatform or a different application \nyou know and building on what Colin just \nsaid there another statement I believe \nto be true is that there will be some \nCentral repository for all the memory \nabout Greg or about any personal person \nso Greg Greg's style my writing style my \npreferences all that will be held \nsomewhere I it my hypothesis is it will \nnot be application specific so for \nexample Salesforce will have a language \nmodel that it's going to know how I \ninteract with Salesforce all right \nthat's great so we'll Zoom so we'll \nprobably Chrome right but what's the \nlanguage model and where's my central \nrepository for all my preferences across \nall of those apps or whatever it may be \nso the reason I bring this up is \nit's still unclear to me if a chat GPT \nlike tool will be that Central \nrepository that knows everything about \nme or if a Google's just going to try to \ngo in there because if you think about \nmost my activity it's all through the \nbrowser right and if you're Google and \nyou did this for me you'd capture 95 of \nwhat I have going on \num \nit's still unclear how that's going to \nplay out but I think it's going to be a \nmixture of both where applications will \nhave their llm but also there's going to \nbe a Greg llm that's going to be \npersonalized to me that everybody else \nwill have as well \nso you think that'll be cross businesses \nthat won't be proprietary to a single \ncompany \nI I well so I think that like obviously \nSalesforce will have their own and gong \nwill have their own and zoom will have \ntheir own and all that \nbut then in order to automate my own \nwork I'm going to want something more \nlocal to me so I think that because \num we won't live in an llm constrained \nworld like there's going to be like an \ninfinite amount as many as many language \nmodels as you want \num \nso I think that there will be one that \nis personalized to me that I own that's \na little closer to me \num and interacting with other llms from \nother tools \nit's really I mean it's inspiring me to \nthink about like kind of like the \nprivate GPT and that whole topic I know \nof you know both of you with this kind \nof like Enterprise B2B experience on \nthese things like \nyeah like you know I know just from like \nhanging out with friends outside of the \nweeviate circle that a lot of them say \nyou know I can't use chat gbt for work \nbecause I can't just like you know put \nmy documents into chat gbt because of \nthe security yeah I'm curious like how \nhow you see the emerging Trends in this \nlike \nlike are more like you know companies \ngonna go to open Ai and say like hey \nopen AI we need you to set this up \ninside of our cloud like the model \ninference server inside our cloud is \nthat something that maybe \nyou know open AI or cohere you know \nanthropic these big model providers \nwould look to or would this maybe be the \nopen source language models or will \npeople start you know training their own \nlanguage models with maybe you know \nMosaic and ML and tools like that \nyeah sure yeah there's a lot there's a \nlot there um so yeah you're absolutely \nright a lot of Enterprises are not \ncomfortable with sending data to open AI \num there's some ways that open AI is \ngetting around that and when I say open \nAI that that'll include you know \nGoogle's offering Palm whatever any of \nthese language model providers so often \nthe way they mitigate that first \nobjection is by saying okay well now \nwe're in your cloud provider platform \nright we're in AWS we're in gcp we're in \nAzure so you can use that and then you \ndon't have to go outside of azure and \nthen the next level is data retention so \nI think with most most of these systems \nyou can opt out of data retention now \nthat's a huge deal for infosec another \nstep that I'm not sure exactly where we \nare on this is dedicated instances right \nso you can get that I'm you will \nprobably be able to get dedicated \ninstances of some of these super high \nperforming language models pretty soon \nand then it probably ends there for the \nmanaged models right and then you step \ninto open source world and in open \nsource world you have those previous \noptions but you also have private Cloud \nyou have on-prem and you will even have \nEdge and Edge is also going to be \ninteresting because we're probably we're \nprobably close to a point where your \num your \nWindows PC or Apple \nMacBook may end up having a llm built \ninto it right and we saw the Palm models \nthey had one that you could fit on \nsmartphones right so at some point the \ncompute may come with your device and \nthat changes things a lot right because \nthen it doesn't leave your device that's \nnot it doesn't leave your Cloud it \ndoesn't leave your device you can do \nanything you want with that probably \nthere's still a little friction just \ngetting these infosec organizations to \ncatch up with all these Concepts and \nunderstand okay what is safe what isn't \nsafe are these things stateful how do we \nknow it for sure but um I was just \nlooking at a company the other day \ncalled ask Sage and they're doing \nthey're providing open AI for government \nentities including you know military \nright so the fact that that is gaining \ntraction \num using those those open AI instances \nand content retention turned off is a \npretty good sign that enterprises and \norganizations are starting to understand \nand realize that they need this and \nthey're willing to take some risks or at \nleast understand those risks better in \norder to do it \nnice the um I agree with Colin that the \nability like these models let me \nrephrase um Sam Walton has another quote \nthat I really enjoy which is the cost of \nintelligence will go to zero right and \nthe cost to serve that intelligence will \nalso go to zero now TBD on the timeline \nfor that but that's the direction it'll \ngo so I agree with Colin fully that the \nability to have compute uh Intelligence \non our Edge devices will 100 be there \nnow we'll we'll the the market adopt \nthat that's a little bit of a different \nquestion for me and the example I want \nto give is \num take for example iMessage versus \nsignal signal uh uh uh touts that \nthey're end and encrypted right well are \nwe all using signal today not really we \nstill we still use iMessage and I know \nthat there's encryption and everything \naround there but I think the point is I \nthink that where this will go is \nI think just the way that we trust \nGoogle and all these big on all these \nother big info companies to handle our \ndata our Gmail our drives and all that I \nthink that'll be the same level of \ncomfortability that we get to with \nlanguage models we're just um we kind of \njumped into a cold pool and we're still \nfeeling the shock of the water right now \nbut I have a feeling that we're going to \nwarm up right to it and once Google or \nonce this becomes the norm in a \ngoogle-like company starts to serve this \nfor us we're all gonna we're all gonna \nbe okay with it \nyeah that that whole thing you know all \nthat introduced so many new ideas to me \nI'd never actually considered llm on the \ndevices like right into the chip like \nthe new M1 chip also comes with a apple \ngbt in it and that's \nthat's a really cool idea all these \nthings and then think about the market \nadoption like I think either we could \ntake this this topic further and talk \nmaybe about like the kind of medical use \ncases and the evolution of that or I \nthink we could talk about sort of \npivoting topics entirely and maybe step \nback into our conversation broadly on \nagent use and before we dove into this \num Greg you had brought up the Chain of \nThought Auto gbt so let me actually ask \nyou guys both quickly do you think we \nshould yeah why don't we it was just as \nthe interview host I'll hijack the topic \nand what let's talk about \nlet's talk about Chain of Thought \nprompting and auto gbt how do you guys \ncurrently see that \num I'll give just a very quick opinion \non this like I said at the beginning of \nthe interview \nnot only are the applications and use \ncases evolving we still don't know like \nwhat's the right way to run these things \nin our business which is super \ninteresting but the tools themselves are \nstill evolving so what is the best \nframework for an agent to Think Through \nyou know we're still figuring that out \nand the the way that we do figure this \nout is through market adoption and we \nsee what handles most of the use cases \nand we let the market help us figure out \nwhat to do here now the fact that we're \ncoming out with new Frameworks every \nsingle week and we haven't yet settled \non one I see that as a beautiful way \nthat Innovation happens and you can't \nspeed this process up anymore let the \ndust settle let's see what kind of \nthings come through here and we need to \ntrust that Lang chain and llama index \nand grip tape and fixie and all these \nfolks will be the ones who will take \nadvantage of these new Frameworks and \nprovide them for the end users like us \nyeah grip tape that's it I haven't heard \nof that one before but I like that name \nbehind it like uh guardrail is another \none that I know with like the preventing \nhallucinations like having layers at the \nend of that yeah it's also interesting I \nmean I guess my thing about the auto gbt \nkind of craze in that is just this idea \nof like you know coming up with a plan \nand then sort of executing the plan \nasynchronously is sort of like the \nComputing Paradigm that I think is \nreally \nreally mind-blowing with this kind of \nidea is like if I say you know I need to \nI need to come up with I don't know like \na way to optimize my code at the lowest \nlevel and it's like research about arm \nprocessors research about simd \ninstructions it's like it can like \nparalyze all this research and like \ncoordinate it how do you think about \nthat kind of component of Auto gbt is \nlike letting all these language model \nthread it's like a new kind of like \nmulti-threaded programming is how I see \nit \nyeah \num so I think there's some challenges to \nadoption with the rogpt Paradigm and uh \nit's something that works really well \nfor an ad hoc Quarry right it's fun it's \nvery cool \nand it demo as well \nit demos so well right but it lacks the \nthings that make it valuable to a a \nserious Enterprise an organization and \nthat could be anyone right that could be \nyou doing your job that could be an \norganization buying it for their for \ntheir people that could be a university \ngiving it to their researchers right and \nwhat it lacks is \num repeatability for one thing and then \nkind of this auditability observability \nthat we don't quite have great \nFrameworks for yet but I'm sure that's \ncoming but to flesh out the \nrepeatability portion a little more \nlet's imagine you have some knowledge \nworkers in an organization right \num you could say all right look Auto GPT \ncan do everything that they do but \nthat's probably not going to work very \nwell because at some point you're going \nto need to compare that with a similar \ntask that a different knowledge worker \nhas done \num so what I think is going to happen in \nthese organizations are people are going \nto look at these knowledge worker \npieces of work work objects that they \nproduce and what you want to do is group \nthem into basically workflows is a term \nI've been using I've heard a lot of \nother people use it as well so let's say \nlet's just take a concrete example \nyou're a data scientist and you're doing \ntopic modeling okay \nshould be familiar to our audience but \nthat's something that you want to \nroughly follow the same pattern every \nsingle time \nbecause you're going to share that with \nother people right and they're going to \ntry to replicate it and if they try to \nreplicate it and their Auto GPT does it \na different way you're going to get \ndifferent answers and what are you going \nto do so I think what's going to happen \nis um \npeople will gradually approach all these \nproblems of various fields and kind of \nsegment them into workflows and you'll \nhave some very frequent ones and you'll \nhave some you'll have a long tail right \nso you have some tasks people do a lot \ntopic modeling you'll have other tasks \nthat people do infrequently like \ntraining a new llm right and so you're \ngoing to take those high frequency \nworkflows and you're going to try to \nautomate them and that might not be \ntotally deterministic right there there \nmight be some some routing decisions \nmade within there \num so that could be thought of as maybe \na sub-agent but then you're going to \nhave some supervisory agent that is \nchoosing that workflow or choosing hey \nthis doesn't fit with anything I'm you \nknow really trained how to do so I'm \ngoing to go the long tail route and just \ngo full auto GPT \num however that's again not as likely to \nto be as useful number one because it's \nharder to trust and number two because \nhopefully if you did this right those \nare less frequent tasks so if you can \nuse your language models and your tools \nand your retrieval to automate these \nhigh frequency workflows I think that's \nhow we're going to see a lot of a lot of \nautomation adopted in terms of these \nlike knowledge worker tasks that people \nwould expect Auto GPT to to address \nColin question for you on that one \num for these for these Advanced \nworkflows there's kind of three pieces \nthere's the language model as the \nreasoning engine \nthere's the task and the prompt that you \ngive it and then there's the memory in \nthe context that it receives right I can \nsee one argument that says once you get \nto a high enough reasoning level like \nhigh enough intelligence level for a \nlanguage model \nthen you could fine-tune that workflow \njust through the prompt and through the \ncontext that you're feeding it so for \nexample the data topic modeling well do \nyou need to have a specialized reasoning \nreasoning engine for that data topic \nmodeling or do you just need one of \nsufficient level pass it the best prompt \nyou can pass it the instructions on how \nto do topic modeling in the first place \nand then let it run wild \nthat could end up being sufficient yeah \nit's very possible but even then you \nknow you have kind of \nadded some deterministic information \nsome you've given it a structure so that \nstructure I think over time will \nprobably evolve toward what you \ndescribed \num yeah \nit well I think you know earlier when I \nbrought up uh what Yana is building with \ncraftful and the child GBC Marketplace \nis very similar to this idea of like you \nknow I compress like Martin grutendors \nThe Bert topic expert in you know topic \nmodel the expert into like a set of \nprompts on how to run topic modeling \nanalysis is like the craftful ideas you \ntake these prompts on how you generally \ndo like user interviews manage user \nfeedback and and yeah so it's so \nfascinating I think I think of this as \nkind of like a skill prompt and I got \nthat kind of like skill prompt from \nlooking at Microsoft semantic kernel and \nthat's like the abstraction that came \naround like um you know like a prompt \nfor how to do question decomposition \nlike our follow-up questions needed this \nis kind of a topic around skill prompts \nit's really related to everything on \nagents is what is the evolution of few \nshot examples do we still need to give a \nfew examples of how to use agents or \nwith you know because Chad gbt like it \nyou know it seems like a lot of time \nlike I think react was a paper that was \nlike zero shot tool use so it's like you \ndon't need to \ngive it examples or train out how to use \na tool so what do you think fuse shot \nprompting give it a few examples of \nusing a tool is that still needed \nyeah I think it's it's definitely still \nneeded and you look at how \nhow people build plugins right now like \nI like you men I like that you mentioned \nsemantic kernel \num I think that's a \ncould end up being a good standard going \nforward because look how they built that \nthey look at how everyone was building \nplug-ins and then they standardized it \nand generalized it right and that's not \nsomething you really get from the open \nsource Community which is kind of just \npurely expanding it doesn't have a good \ncontract stage yet whereas Microsoft \nwith that framework has done their \nexpand and contract already \num \nbut in terms of if you want to give a \nsystem new capabilities with a new tool \num \nit's most likely that you want to do \nthat with fuse shot \num you sure you could just describe it \nbut why would you do away with giving it \nadditional information I think there is \na place that fails though which is let's \nsay you have multiple tools and the tool \ncould couldn't include a retrieval \nsystem uh you know Atomic tool or also a \nworkflow let's say let's say these \ninteract with each other or they're \ndependent on each other each other in \nsome way then the kind of oh I'm adding \na plug-in so here's my few shots and \nhere's my you know interface that kind \nof breaks because you need few shots \nthat cross between the different tools \nplugins workflows whatever and um that \nmay be a time where you'll need to \neither develop a lot more few shots but \nyou can also see how that would like the \npermutations of that would would get out \nof control pretty quickly or possibly \neven train a specialized model to do \nthat sort of planning that it needs to \ndo in order to figure out how to use \nthis this environment of tools rather \nthan just thinking about it is you know \nI can do one or two things \num \nyeah I was gonna say I'm with Colin of \ncourse nobody knows but my hypothesis is \nthat a few shot examples will still be \naround because even if you craft the \nmost perfect prompt I don't think you're \ngoing to account for every single \nsituation and giving like a picture \nspeaks a thousand words well so does a \nfew examples as well \nlike the story of a lot of machine \nlearning is you know examples and then \njust the research has been how do we \nlearn from as little data as possible \nand now we've seen that um calling you \nsaid something though I I hadn't heard \nthat abstraction before open source is \nabout the expanding whereas like a \ncentralized entity is the contraction I \nthink that you know like it makes a lot \nof sense and I think that is really \ninteresting and then something I think \nis really fascinating as well is I think \nGreg is one of the world's experts on \nkeeping up with this expanding of what \npeople are doing with prompts Greg has a \nseries called early AI signals and you \ncan see the you know notion template \nreally nice organization of these things \nand I think this would be a perfect \ntransition Greg if you could talk about \nlike this expanding and how you're \nkeeping up with it \nsure absolutely so \num I have a small side project called \nearly signals and it started as an \nexperiment really because there used to \nbe the saying that every spreadsheet \ntemplate was a future startup and if you \nlooked at the Craigslist home page every \nlink on there was a future startup it's \nlike home rental Airbnb car rental Toro \net cetera and I was uh just on just \nsocial media in general Twitter Youtube \nHacker News all that stuff and I noticed \nthat people were using chat gbt for ways \nthat it was not intended to be used they \ndidn't really know you know how it was \ngoing to be used so people saying oh I \nuse chat GPT for therapy \nhmm interesting I use GPT to write my \ncover letters to help me with my resume \nand all this and I thought to myself man \nis chat GPT really the optimal product \nexperience to execute against those \nworkflows likely not so this could be an \nopportunity to productionalize that that \nworkflow now the hard part about this \nand the piece I need to emphasize is you \ndo not have a defensible business if you \njust productionalize a prompt so it's a \nstarting point I I believe and there's \nthe hint of it and somebody needs to go \nout and go build more defensibility \naround it but early signals I have a \ncollection of those ideas and \num it's about weekly I try to go through \nand say say my favorite five but then \ngive folks the access to I think we're \nup to like 70 to or 80 different \nworkflows and the important part for \neach one of these is that I need to show \nwhere a user has said that they do this \nthing so I don't want it to be \nsomebody's idea I wanted to be a user \nsays I do this right now and so you \nalready have a little bit of user for uh \nadoption for right there \nyeah I think it's so useful it's such a \ncool you know it's so interesting just \ngoing through it I think like from like \nthe AI girlfriend to like the uh \nyeah just like um the whole collection \nof all these things that people do with \nit and I mean yeah I I I'm just like I'm \nI'm still kind of like my mind is \nblowing through my head thinking about \nthis kind of Open Source expansion kind \nof idea because I do think like Lang \nchin like when it first came out the way \nthat it was like open source and this \nkind of collecting the prompts and it's \nvery similar to what you're doing with \nthe early AI signals is just like maybe \nif I connected to like hugging face in \nthe model Hub the open source like how \nthey've managed to seize open source and \nit's like because they have you know \nit's like what are we gonna do with this \nnew tool and it's so creative \nand it's just pretty interesting uh \nquick quick I think another Sam almond \nquote that I really enjoy and I keep on \nquoting them here but \num \nthe reason the reason he States why they \nrelease slow is because the collective \nintelligence of the human population is \nunpredictable it's unpredictable they \nhave no idea what what humans are going \nto do so it's like all right here's chat \ngbt what do people do here's plugins \nwhat do people do here's API you know \nEtc et cetera \num I think that open source expansion \nopen source moves quick like you're \ntalking about Indie hackers all over the \nworld that are putting out really \ninnovative ideas one of the Prime \nexamples of this is baby AGI the founder \nof that was not a technical by trade \nperson per se he's a VC so how cool is \nit that somebody who isn't necessarily \ntechnical is building this tool that all \npeople around the world can take \nadvantage of and I think that I think \nthat speaks to the open source types of \nworld on there now \num proprietary and closed will all will \ncatch up to it but they're driven less \nby let's provide \num selfless Innovation out into the \nworld and they're more commercially \ndriven but it's all it all it all \nfollows \nI think it depends on that this stage \nwe're in also right because we're still \nvery early and talking about something \nlike agents no one even agrees on the \nabstractions right \nlike I I was looking at uh fixie which \nis a pretty cool company and \num they have a you know open source \npackage available for agents as well and \nthey call \neverything agents so like a plug-in for \nthem is an agent right so we can't even \nagree on the abstractions and \neventually we probably will \nand at that point we need to contract \nthe \num \nwe need to focus right and that's not \nsomething we're getting a lot of at this \nstage from tools like Lane chain for the \nthe general agent stuff and from llama \nindex your other example for the \ningestion stuff right I think both of \nthese started out very successful \nbecause they gave \nrandom people quick cookbooks on how to \nput things together \nright that was the value they provided \nit was simple abstractions a collection \nof wrappers that was basically it like I \nthink a lot of people ended up starting \nusing Lang chain just because it was \nmarginally you know four lines of code \neasier to do that and instantiate \nweeviate than it was to instantiate \ndeviate from the like the weeviate \ndocumentation which isn't the fault of \nwebe that's just how software works \nright so they made a wrapper that shrunk \nit \num and same with the openai endpoint so \nthat was valuable to people for a while \nand I think a lot of people are still \nprimarily deriving value from it for \nthat reason however as it as it balloons \nas it gets bigger and bigger you're \ngoing to start to lose the cookbook of \nthe system because there's too many \noptions and I think you'll see that \nhappen to llama index really quickly is \neverybody builds a different document \nparser right and so all of a sudden I go \nto this I go to this GitHub and I want \nto find a document parser and instead of \nhaving three options where the \ndifferences are clearly articulated I \nnow have 2500 right because that's what \nyou're going to have look at hugging \nface it even happens on hugging face how \nmany models are on hugging face \nthousands how many of them are useful \nvery very few we don't trust hugging \nface to tell us which hogging face \nmodels are useful even we often get that \nfrom somewhere else \nso um yeah these these open source \nexpanding Frameworks will need to be \ncareful \num and be sure to do some Contracting at \nsome point or else these \nFrameworks that are much more \nopinionated like semantic kernel are \ngonna eat their lunch because they were \ndeveloped kind of with the same process \noriginally right these these Microsoft \npeople just built a bunch of plugins but \nthen they took that learning and in an \norganized way turned it into a true \nframework \nthat people could agree on and was as \nwidely valuable \nyeah that is that is just gold insights \nI I feel like I take took away so much \nfrom that I mean um like we think a lot \nabout the weevier cookbook and how we \nwant to design this thing and yeah it's \nlike you know Tech search with this data \nset text search with that slightly \ndifferent data set where you'd use \ndifferent properties is that the best \nway to design a cookbook or do you just \nend up with like 2 000 examples and it's \nlike that just confuses you \ncompared to like one text one image one \nmultimodal and just keeping it to the \npoint it's pretty fascinating um I guess \nI kind of like in this topic of Open \nSource I thought maybe there is a link \nto jump to this next topic which is \nmulti-agent systems like where we have \nit's kind of like it kind of is similar \nto Auto gbt to me but like you know say \nyou have like multiple agents that like \nlive in some kind of simulation I mean I \nhad uh you Shang Wu on the podcast who's \nbuilt chat Arena and what chattering is \nabout is like you know we Greg Colin \nConnor we each are like retrieval \naugmented chat Bots that talk to each \nother and maybe a third language model \nis judging like who's saying the best \npoints and stuff like these kind of like \nchat games but like how do you think \nabout that kind of like multi-agent uh \nllm systems \nI um quick comment on that one if you \nwere to ask why \ndo we do this multi-agent thing in the \nfirst place and it's really uh \ndeficiency in the current models right \nnow not to be able to handle that type \nof computation or that type of \nprediction or whatever it may be right \nand so I I think that is the use case \ngoing to be there in the future where \nyou want to interact with an arena of \npeople sure we're seeing the market \nalready want that right now is the \nanswer multi-agent well it's a pretty \nconvenient way to constrain One agent to \nlike think about a certain thing and \nconstrain its memory and all that \num is that the only way you can \nconstruct that type of application no \nand so is that the framework that I \nthink is going to be the one that \npersists uh still TBD I'm not going to \nmake a hypothesis not yet \nyeah I think you're totally on base Greg \num \na lot of yeah the reason you do that is \nto make up for their shortcomings and if \nyou had a smarter model why would you \nneed to have two of them talking to each \nother if it can just \nyou know understand okay well I've got \nthis stuff in my context and I should do \nsomething a little differently because \nthat's all the other one does it's just \nlike they're just swapping contexts in a \nin a different sort of way I think the \nplace where we might see more of that \nbeing necessary is yeah further toward \nthe edge more open source where you you \nmaybe have the smaller uh specialized \nmodels like for example that that one we \nkind of talked about where it's trained \nto use a certain group of tools \ntogether but um as you get smarter \nmodels it shouldn't be as important \nI mean I think it's just absolutely \nfascinating I I think it's very related \nto just like real companies kind of like \nlike if I think about how like \nyou know if I'm if I'm playing this \nthese roles in this multi-agent system \nthe first person is like looking at the \nTwitter feed you know doing the early AI \nsignals curation and then sees this \nthing and says I think this could fit in \nweeviate just like someone who's just \npicking things I think could go in \nwebiate then you pass that to like the \nproduct manager role playing LM who you \nknow has this particular retrieval and \nmaybe also fine-tuning to use those kind \nof tools to say okay here's the proposal \nthen the engineer you know who's more \nfamiliar with the code base and the \ninternals of the database and stuff like \nokay and then uses the chains of like \nthe you know code execution tool used to \nlike prototype and develop a prototype \nand then you know you have like some \nkind of maybe internal pull request \nreview that happens with role-playing of \nlike different engineer llms and then \nyou have like the marketing and like you \nknow without explaining like all the \nroles of the engineering company like do \nyou think you don't think do you think \nthat thing would be superseded by just \none large language model that sees the \nnew thing on Twitter have her ingest \ndata however it comes up with ideas and \njust end to end just I don't need this \nkind of role playing it's just like \ntotally unnecessary \nuh I think my previous statement was \njust assuming they're all built in from \nthe same language model and the same \nmodel that comes in from there now when \nyou start to speak around specialized \ntasks \nI think in in that case \nit's still TBD but a lot of popular \nopinion is around that you're gonna have \nspecialized models that come around and \nthen with that if that precipitates \nspecialized agents then you'll have a \nmulti-agent world to complete those \ntasks \nyeah I mean it's like well they're kind \nof like two emerging topics in large \nlanguage models I think which is the \nfirst of which is fine-tuning is \nbecoming cheaper we see like the Q Laura \nthe quantize low rank adaptation that's \nmaking it look like you can you know I \nthink they say they fine-tuned a 65 \nbillion parameter or large language \nmodel on a 48 gigabyte GPU and so it's \nlike \nit's like that kind of thing is going to \nget a lot easier like way easier than \nit's ever been right how do you think \nabout that kind of Trends in fine tuning \nuh yeah I mean they're definitely making \nprogress I think there's still some \nunknowns there was a paper that came out \nrecently talking about how the non \nthe non-managed models it turns out \ndon't generalize nearly as well as as \nthings like GPT 3.5 so I'm sure we can \nlink that I don't recall the title of it \nat the moment \num but if you if you look at that what \nis it saying it's saying these open \nsource models aren't as good as we \nthought they were and they don't \ngeneralize as well to unseen tasks that \nactually makes a case for more \nfine-tuning right if your business has \ncertain tasks you expect you need to do \nthere's more need for you to fine-tune \nthose models again stepping aside from \nthe the super powerful model is the \ngpt4s of the world if you're going \ntoward these smaller models then yeah \nfine tuning will probably be more \nimportant and it does seem to be getting \nway cheaper and that goes hand in hand \nwith the hosting costs or the inference \ncosts as well right they're kind of \ntightly correlated so with that that \nquora paper that was really cool I'm \nexcited about that um yeah you can run \ninference and training for now it's it's \naccessible to you know you need a little \na couple talented people to do it \nprobably but um that's kind of your only \nobstacle \nyeah I think that's exactly correct I \nmean you need to you need to then have \nlike the you know all the ml Ops skills \nto take advantage of that kind of thing \nbut then if it saves you money saves you \nthat much money compared to like all \nthese repeated inferences of the super \nsmart thing so then the second big Trend \nI'm very curious about are these like \nreally long input lengths like \nanthropics is 100k input lengths how do \nyou think that'll change agents \nI don't know do you know how they do \nthat either you guys know how they did \nthat did they just pay the price or \nor did they have some trick I feel like \npeople are still trying to figure that \nout \nwell I think with mosaics uh MPT they \ntalked they you know talked about Alibi \nattention and how you can do this kind \nof like sparse attention where yeah I \nmean I don't know the exact mechanics of \nit and I'm sure they optimize it like \nall the way down to the Cuda cores and \nlike you know have a lot of engineering \nthat goes into that but \nyeah one one quick thought about it \num and then I'd love to hear what you \nthink Greg but with the longer attention \nI think \ntraining probably becomes a lot more \ndifficult and expensive too so beyond \nthe compute which ordinarily with with \nattention skills quadratically right \num that's a problem but then also if you \nwant to generate fine-tuning examples \nthat um \nthey replicate some long context tasks \nthat you want to do in the wild you need \nto generate some examples of that right \nand so if you're having people right \n80 \n000 word \nexamples then you're going to spend a \nlot of money doing that you probably \nneed pretty smart people generating \nthose examples but then the other side \nof things is with longer context length \nsome applications look different right \nyou don't have to do as much retrieval \nthere's a there's a certain window that \nopens up of data that where you can just \nput that in the in the context in the \nprompt \nand it's not clear how much further \nwe'll be able to go \nbut that definitely does change okay how \noften do you need to do retrieval \num to yeah you can put some in the \nprompt \nyou know I think maybe I'm wearing the \nadversarial hat being in a vector \ndatabase company but we're already \nseeing papers like large language models \nare distracted by relevant context \ncalling in your Haystack presentation \nyou talked about n greater than one \nsearch result in the prompt you know it \nbecomes trickier so yeah I'm I think \nthat it's the the pro of retrieval is \nlike you could still pack a hundred \nthousand with all sorts of information \nsources as you search across classes \nwith different queries and stuff just to \npack this prompt as densely as possible \nyeah and then generally I think \nit'd be hard to train those models I \nagree with that \nyeah and for me I think that long \ncontext weight length it demos really \nwell \nit does well on Twitter and I think the \nreason why people are excited about it \nbecause it's storytells really well too \nit's like oh now pass a book into this \nwhole thing however the minute the \nbenchmarks start to go down I become \nless interested and so really \nis kind of a dramatic statement I don't \ncare I don't care as much about context \nlength at all I want improved reasoning \ncheaper and then longer contact well no \nimproved reasoning cheaper lower latency \nand then uh longer contacts contacts \nlengths for that because like Khan said \nwhich I agree with \nit's a bit of a it's a controversial \nstatement but a longer context length \nallows you to be lazier on retrieval and \nit almost makes up for your inability to \nnot do retrieval as well as you should \nbe doing in the first place potentially \nI know it's a bit it's a bit of an \noverstatement but I think that I am fine \nwith managing a shorter context length \nand needing to beef up my deterministic \nretrieval to start then \num then somebody's saying oh now you can \ndo a million tokens \nit forces you to build a better system \ndoesn't it \nyeah fascinating uh Greg and Colin I \nthought this was such a great tour of \nall these topics of llm Agents I mean I \nlearned so much on these podcast uh \nthose podcasts um wrapping it up uh Greg \nand Colin could you each maybe uh give \nlisteners like where to find you keep up \nwith your content hopefully they're you \nknow that's why I read the podcast and \nwant to just dive into all the online \ncontent you have um \nyeah absolutely so two places on YouTube \nI run underneath the channel called Data \nindependent you can find me over there \nwith a bunch of uh Lang chain content \nearly signals and all that good stuff \nand then most of my communication \nhappens on Twitter so I'm just at Greg \ncamerad \nhey everyone apologies the recording \ncrashed right as we were doing the \noutros you can find Colin on his blog at \ncolinharman.substack.com and you can \nalso find calling on LinkedIn at Colin \nHarmon one more quick bonus on the outro \nyou can check out Colin's new talk at \nHaystack us 2023 stop hallucinations and \nhalf truths and generative search now \nuploaded to the open source connections \nYouTube channel as a bonus you can see \nthe ordis Chrome plugin from Alexa \ngordick this new AI summarization tool \nfor YouTube another really cool thing uh \nand then also in the spirit of it here's \nGreg's Channel data Independence so many \nincredible videos on lighting chain \ntutorials uh new things about AI the \nearly signal series all sorts of cool \nstuff so thank you so much for watching \nthe podcast and please be sure
