{"text": "Weaviate is a full-fledged vector database with full CRUD support. In this meetup, Etienne Dilocker of Weaviate explains how ... \nthanks thanks a lot for joining and uh \ntoday i will as \nbob just said i will really give you a \nbit of a more of a \ndeep deep dive on uh basically how vb-8 \nworks under the hood \nuh what its architecture is but also \nwhat our roadmap is \nand also focus on the whole aspect of \ncloud native a bit more \nso why do we do such a deep dive \nmeetup um so as i just said this is \nreally going to be about more \nsort of in looking at the inside of bb8 \nuh if you haven't heard of vba did or \nhaven't used yet um just to let you know \nthere's also a new introduction video \nout that i bought recorded i think \nuh one or two days ago and that just \nwent live and it basically shows you all \nof the things that you can do \nwith uh vv8 in like a 10 minute \nintroduction \nuh for today i'm going to assume that \nyou have a very rough understanding of \nwhat vv8 is so that i can um \ntell you basically how it works and how \nit works under the hood \nso why do we do this first up this is \nbasically been based on on your feedback \nso based on community feedback and \nthere's been very positive feedback \nwe've heard people say that while the \narchitecture is one of the reasons \nof why i want to use vba or maybe \nthey've even used something else before \nbut that doesn't \nmaybe isn't compatible uh with what they \nexpect for \nfrom a search engine architecture-wise \nso that's very good for us to hear \nbut there were also critical voices that \nsaid well you aren't very open about the \narchitecture you should highlight it a \nbit more \nor maybe explain the architecture a bit \nmore so basically \nthis is us being vocal about the \narchitecture \nand highlighting what's going on under \nthe hood so that you don't have to read \nthe the code \nto get an understanding \nanother thing is just overall sort of if \nyou look at the ml and lp \nfield uh nlp field um and if you look at \nthis sort of research versus production \nthing a lot of projects are in a very \nvery early stage \nwhere basically um the teams at the \ncompany at large enterprise companies \nevery large enterprise company needs to \nhave \nat least one a team focusing on ml stuff \nand nlp stuff \nbut a lot of these projects aren't in \nproduction yet there's \nmaybe a bit of research going here and \nmaybe it's because the business has \nother priorities \nor maybe because the the quality of \nthose nlp tools maybe they're not good \nenough yet \nbut another part of that is also because \ngetting stuff to production is very very \nhard \nthere's a lot of things that are \ncurrently or that that suddenly get \nintroduced when you want to move to \nproduction \nthat simply aren't the case if you're \njust doing sort of a spike or \ndiscovery with some stuff locally so \nbasically you can't just take the \njupiter notebook and put it into \nproduction and even if you could you \nprobably shouldn't \nbut uh the good thing is that there's \nsolutions such as bb-8 \nthat really are meant for production so \nbasically \nwhat i want to convey today is that if \nyou have \nthose production requirements which can \nmean large scale it could mean that you \nneed redundancy \nfault tolerance it could mean that you \nhave specific security \nuh requirements that you want your stuff \nto be observable then that \nis really what vba is meant for and also \nby being \nopen about sort of how we achieve all of \nthat and giving you a bit more insight \ni also want to convey that basically the \npeople behind vvate \nthat they make conscious decisions and \nthat while we do sort of what we do that \nwe really \nalso know what we're talking about so it \ngives you a bit of trust in us as a team \nbuilding a solution that's meant for \nproduction \nso this is a graphic that i just tweeted \nout maybe some of you have seen it um \nyesterday and basically this is a very \nsimple \nbenchmark of uh importing a specific \ndata set into vba \nand i will sort of tie this into our \ncurrent architecture roadmap \nof where we are and what's been \nhappening but the main takeaway for this \nat this point is basically just \nwe've been improving things and things \nhave been going going faster \nand basically as you can see on this \nroadmap sort of each new version reduced \nthe time that it took to import a data \nset into v8 \nand um yeah you'll see in a second how \nthat ties into our architectural \nroadmap so before we get \nto the roadmap itself i also want to \ntalk about how data is stored in bb8 \nsort of \nat a very very rough aspect like the 30 \n000 \nfeet view just to to show you sort of \nwhat happens in vba \nwhen something gets stored and an \nimportant thing or an important \ndistinction \nbetween vv8 as a vector search engine \nand as database \nif you compare it to for example just a \na a \nn library vba really as a as a \nyeah as a database it returns the entire \nobject and this object can be \non disk and not just maybe a reference \nto that object not just an id \nbut not just that you can also combine \nthe vector search itself \nwith a structured filter so we call that \nscalar search so for an example \nyou could say well give me all the users \nthat are close to this specific user \nwhich would be the vector search part \nsort of \nthe fuzzy part in the vector space but \nonly if the account balance of that user \nis \nin this example less than or equal to \ntwo thousand \nand basically we can do that efficiently \nand not um \nsort of uh what we wanna do is basically \ndo this sort of uh pre uh uh \nfilter where we say like okay first we \nto know what those users \nare and then limit the vector search to \nthose users because if you do it the \nother way around \nif you do a post filter then you first \ndo your vector search \nbut then maybe none of the results that \nwere returned in that limited search \nmaybe none of those match the filter so \nbasically \nwe want to do this pre-filtered or we do \ndo this pre-filter \nand also because it's a database any \nmutation that you do so any import \nanything that you do in in viviate by \nthe time that we have returned or by the \ntime vba has returned a successful \nstatus code to you \nyou can be sure that that data is \nwritten somewhere on disk so it \nbasically \ngives you the right guarantees that you \nget from a database as opposed to i \ndon't know like a library that would \nonly run in memory for example \nand as a result this means that um when \nwe store \ndata per index so you see here is \nbasically \none index that we have per class and \nwell we'll see this graphic a few times \nmore today \num generally there are three parts \nthere's a vector index \nright now the vector index that we \nsupport is h and sw \nso that's sort of a very common index \nsuits are \nour purpose very well because it allows \nmutability it's \nsort of relatively easy to customize but \nalso because we surf the object \nwe need to store the object so that's \nthe object storage and we need to build \nup this inverted index so that's \nbasically what allows us to do these \npre-filters that we can then combine \nwith the vector index so essentially \nthese are the three things \nthat we store \nso what you see here is an overview of a \nroadmap and the cool thing about this \nis um other than the nice visualizations \nthat we have \nthe cool thing about this is that we're \nnot starting at step zero right now so \nbasically \num yeah you've seen the the uh the \ngraphic with the import times that we're \ngoing down \num we're already so this is already \ngoing on so some things are already \ncomplete and other things are basically \nin development right now \noh sorry that was that was too quick so \nhere if we start with step one so step \none the first thing that we we did and \nthis was also triggered a bit by \ncommunity feedback so \num a few what was it i don't know about \ntwo or three months ago i think um \nwe were trending on github for for a \ncouple of days and a lot of new users \ncame into vvad and it was really cool it \nwas sort of \nthe first time that we got a lot of \nfeedback like of course people had \ndiscovered vba before already but that \nwas the first time \nthat we got a lot of users in and they \nwere able to give us \nsort of feedback very different feedback \non very different parts some of the \ndocumentation some on \nthe implementation and one of the things \nwas basically \none of the feedback points that we got \nwas basically hey this is hmsw that's \npretty cool \nbut i noticed that if i import a large \ndata set it's \nkind of slow like it doesn't it doesn't \nget the kind of performance that i would \nexpect from hnsw and then \nwe sort of took that feedback seriously \nand compared and saw that okay yeah \nthat this is true like it's it's \nfast-ish \nbut it's not as fast as maybe hnsw could \nbe \nuh so basically the first step that we \nsaid on this this sort of the \nthe end goal of the roadmap is just \nscaling in general and as you'll see \nlater scaling includes horizontal \nscaling \nbut scaling in general for us also just \nmeans being able to \nto work with larger data that's like \nobviously when the space of \nof big data so we need to be able to to \nhandle large data sets \nand one part of being able to handle \nlarge data sets is if we're \nbuilding this sort of expensive vector \nindex at import time \nit just means we need to do it fast \nenough so um the first step was \nbasically \noptimizing the h w index implementation \nthis was mostly fixing a few bucks here \nand there just \ngeneral performance optimization viva it \nis written in go so there are a couple \nof things that we could do \nand also one thing that i find \nparticularly cool \nis if we have one assembly file right \nnow in our implementation \nuh where uh the the dot product \ncalculation that we use \nthat we also use for for cosine distance \nof course and distance in \nvba is just a normalization of the \nvector and then \ndoing a dot product calculation which is \nthe same thing as cosine distance but \nit's a bit \nfaster if you only have to normalize \nonce um yeah and \nthis is uh there we have an optimization \nnow for \num for avx-2 compatible cpus which \ndoesn't work by default in go so we had \nto write it in assembly which then you \ncan integrate and go \nwhich is i think this was the major \ndifference then if you compared a \nlibrary like hmswlip which is like \nthe reference implementation is the \nimplementation that that came along with \nthe paper \nand that's written in c plus plus if you \ncompared that to vb8 before or to vba's \nh and sw implementation \nuh while we were just not using these \nhardware acceleration i'm not these \nusing these \navx2 instructions and that's where we we \nlost a lot of \nspeed so basically we have completed \nthat \nand this was released with all the other \nperformance improvements in \nv 1.4 so if you look at the the road map \nuh sorry no the roadmap at this graphic \nof the benchmark \nuh 1.2 uh was basically yeah that was \nthe the controller sort of the base \nbefore we started optimizing anything \num and it's the time was so high that \nyou can't even see it in this graphic \nanymore it moved off the the top of the \nscreen \nand then in 1.3 we took care of a couple \nof performance \nfixes and then 1.4 i'm using 1.41 here \nbecause it was the latest 1.4 version \nbut that the fixes themselves or the \noptimizations were introduced in 1.4 \nalongside with the uh image2vec module \nby the way \nso if you want to use um if you want to \nvectorize images out of the box that has \nbeen possible since 1.4 \num yeah and there you see the the major \ndrop-off from from 1.3 which doesn't fit \non the screen \nanymore two to one point four so \nbasically these changes \nwere step one on the roadmap but as you \ncan see \nuh there's something else on the horizon \nand um \nyeah and that's basically the next step \nso \nlet me get into that \nso when you sort of design a database \ncompletely from scratch or when you plan \nout a database you have to make \na couple decisions you have to make a \nlot of decisions but one decision that \nyou definitely have to make \nis like is my database gonna be read \npreferring or is it right preferring \nand this this has a lot of impact and \nessentially \nby the time we decided to build vb8 um \nh and sw just came out or was just \nsort of just gained i think it's been \nout for longer but it just gained \npopularity in the community \nand people were using it and we were \nbasically thinking that's a really cool \nstart we need to build \na product around this like we need to \nbuild a whole database around it \nso sort of this focus on these fast \nquery performances \nthat you could get with h w was pretty \nclear for us like okay that's \nthat's the the sort of benefit of a \nvector search that we need to to offer \nlike \nit needs to be fast at query time so \nbasically \nwhen we started out we were saying okay \nthat's the the first goal that we need \nto achieve it needs to be fast to \nto read um but turns out \nthat if you if you do these things that \nwe do with vba \nwhich also means that if you also store \nthe object and if you also \num build up this inverted index \nand if you're generally in a space where \nthere's a lot of data \nit turns out that you also write a lot \nof data and that they just can easily \nbecome the bottleneck \nso basically what good is the fastest \nreading database \nif importing data or ingesting data into \nthat database \ntakes so long that you can never get to \na very large use case that \nthe database could basically easily \nhandle from \nfrom a read perspective but you just can \nnever get there because it's \nit's or i don't know because you you in \nuh you create more data maybe that your \nyour database can ingest for example \nand um that's basically the point where \nwe said okay now that we fixed \nsome of the performance issues that were \ngoing on in the vector index \nand where that we're building now the \nactual bottleneck is just storing the \nobjects itself so now we need to address \nthis and this has been a \na pretty big change so this it just \nmerged the the pull request that had i \nthink it was \nexactly 100 commits then they had had to \nfix something else then it was 101 but \nso sort of just to put this into \nperspective this is like a major change \nthat's been \nbeen happening in vva and essentially we \nwent from um \nfrom sadie's b-bolt which is a fork of \nthe i don't know \nwho it's by the original bold which is a \num yeah \na key value store that's written in go \nthat uses a b plus tree approach \nso essentially sort of a very common \npattern \nthat you have for for yeah disk access \nor for for \ndata access on disk that works pretty \nwell \nthis data data store this key value \nstore also supports transactions which \nis something we haven't actually needed \nat all in in vba so far \nand then we made the decision okay we \nneed something now that works better on \non writing we write a lot of data we \nneed something that's not \nthe bottleneck there this is why we went \nwith an lsm \ntree approach and essentially in lsm3 \napproach it's actually it's actually \nquite simple but at the same time it's \nalso \nalso kind of genius it's also in use by \na lot of databases basically all the \ndatabases that you \nyou know that are really good at \ningesting a lot of data \nin in very little time they probably use \neither an ls m3 directly or \nsomething similar to to an lsm tree and \nthe idea is in an osm tree that \nbasically you start out with an \nin-memory structure \nso you you import your data and just put \nit into \na memory structure and in this memory \nstructure the only thing that you do \nwhen you add something \nis you make sure that that structure \nitself is sorted \nso whenever you have something sorted \nit's pretty easy to access it like \ni don't know if you have a sorted list \nthen you can do a binary search and \nthat's pretty efficient to access it \nso that's the only thing that needs to \nneeds to happen in an \nuh in this memory store it needs to be \nsorted \nonce this memory store grows too big you \nsimply write it to disk as is you take \nthis thing that's already sorted \nwrite it to disk one go so if writing in \none go on \nonto your disk super fast if you have an \nssd disk \ndefinitely but even on a spinning disc \nlike just one seek \nright i don't know 10 megabytes of data \npretty fast \nuh the problem with an in memory \nstructure \nis that it's in memory so you don't have \nthe the \nguarantee of having something on disk uh \nif it's never been written and \nif we're saying that the efficiency \ncomes from the fact that you import into \nmemory for let's say \ni don't know 15 seconds then there's \nalso 15 seconds of data that could \npotentially be \nbe lost if if the database crashes and i \njust said in the beginning like vb-8 is \nthe the tool that really wants to be the \ndatabase and that um yeah we can't just \nsay okay oh well sorry you lost the last \n15 seconds of \num of your data that you wrote so \nwe can fix that by writing into a write \nahead lock \nand basically write a headlock or \nsometimes also called commit log \nis another file that we write into \nthat's also append only so we only never \nseek in that file but basically just \nstart writing into and just write \nat the end of it so basically this data \nthat we ingest \nthat was sorted in memory we're also \nwriting it into a file \nwhere it's not sorted just sort of as a \nas a backup basically if something \nhappens and then if if nothing happens \nwe can just write the sorted part onto \ndisk \ncreate this kind of segment and then \nstart with a new segment \nand the cool thing is that basically \neven if you've just written \nhundreds of gigabytes or terabytes of \ndata when you start with a new segment \nyou basically start \nfrom scratch you start with a new file \nit's a new file that you're writing into \nso essentially this simply doesn't \ncongest it doesn't slow down it has a \nsort of constant \nuh write speed and that is very \nimportant because that was exactly \nthe issue that we had with the b plus \ntree before and good read performance \nuh but when writing at some point it \nwould just \nuh um yeah it was basically it would \nbasically \nslow down so if we look at the the road \nmap \nthat's what we're seeing so in in from \n1.4 to 1.5 \nwhich is out now by the way as a release \ncandidate you can you can start using it \num by the time we we this this goes from \nthe release candidate to the \nthe full release there'll probably be \nsome smaller changes we're going to add \none or two features but those are \nunrelated to the ls entries which is \nthings that we still want to get in the \nrelease \num that we make um but from the sort of \nperformance aspect you can start using \nthis \nand and it should work well and if it \ndoesn't then please do tell us that's \nwhy we have the release candidate \nso that we can make sure that if \nsomething goes wrong \nthat we can fix it so this makes \nimporting this data \nabout 130 percent faster on on this \nparticular data set of course these \nthese numbers are very specific to one \ndata set um but it's more about the sort \nof the relative comparison \num yeah that made it 130 faster \nand this is sort of only from writing \nthe data so the \nthe expensive thing that we're doing is \nbasically \num it's basically building the agents w \nindex \num but as you could see sort of because \nwe're writing so much data that was the \nbottleneck \nthat we had to to take away \nso something else that i i want to say \nis \nright now uh i was talking about \nsegments in \nan lsm tree and basically these segments \ni'm not sure if i \neven said that but these segments can \nalso be merged over time and then you \nbasically combine a lot of small \nsegments into a larger segment and then \nyou have \nsort of one sorted file which is again a \nbit more efficient to \nto um yeah to to use \nif you've heard of um for example the \nhsw implementation \nin open distro or if you've been \nfollowing what's happening with leucine \nthen you might not be saying oh segments \nnot \nnot good for a vector surgeon so let me \nlet me explain why \non the one hand we have the vector index \nwhich \num has a o of log in order this is \nspecific to hmsw \nwhich has an o of log n time complexity \nat query time \nso essentially what that means is bigger \nis better you want to have one \nlarge index and um with this \nsort of very primitive example \ncalculation where i'm pretending \nthat there's a thousand objects well if \nyou have log of a thousand which is \nthree \ntimes one then your cost is three and if \nyou were to now split this intex \nin index into a hundred small parts that \neach just contain \nten then log of 10 is 1 but you have to \ndo 100 searches \nso now your total cost is 100. so \nbasically it's a very \nvery made up example with very made up \nnumbers but to illustrate \nthat really on on this kind of vector \nindex it's much better \nto have one large one than multiple \nsmall ones \nin addition when when you merge \nsomething \nan hms w index unfortunately at least no \none has really figured out how to do it \nefficiently yet you can't really combine \nmultiple h and sw indexes \ninto um into one big one i mean you can \nof course \nbut is is as expensive as building them \nin the first place or even slightly more \nexpensive because like the the new index \nis now going to be bigger than the \nindividual ones \nso um basically for h and sw that's \nthat's a problem and what we want to do \nis we want to avoid that our vector \nindex gets segmented \nso this one we really want to have one \none big one now \non the ls entry that's on the other side \nof the screen it's exactly the opposite \nlike we we just \nshow uh showed that basically um \nthese small sectors or these small \nsegments are exactly what keeps that \nthing fresh and what keeps it fast at \nright speed so here we do have those \nsegments \nand um while we have those segments \nthere's a \nsuch a thing called a bloom filter which \nis really cool too it's a probabilistic \nsort of way of telling whether data is \ncontained in a specific segment \nand the cool thing about bloom filters \nis that it never has false negatives \nit can have false positives so it might \nbe the case that it tells you yes the \ndata is in there and then you open this \nthing up and you look for it and \nwas a false alarm data wasn't there but \nit can never have false negatives so \nyou can never sort of misstate it that \nway and this bloom filter can be \nsort of used to make looking up data \nin very many small segments very \nefficient \num and and then even sort of \nyeah over time you can even merge those \nsegments into \ninto smaller segments sorry into fewer \nbut larger segments \nand then basically over time uh you have \nthe same as if there were never any any \nsegments in the first place and that's a \nrelatively cheap \nprocess because as we said before like \neach segment is basically just a sorted \nfile \nand if you take two sorted files and uh \ntry to put them into sort of a next file \nwhich is again sorted \nthat's basically like a like a merge \nsort so that's a relatively uh \ncheap and easy uh process so on the lsm \nside \nwe're accepting the segmentation we're \nsaying this is what we're not just \naccepting it we're really saying this \nis by design of how an ls tree works \nand we say that we can also just improve \nit async \nbut if you look at the entire thing \nservant this is really what would tell \nthe vvat storage uh apart from for \nexample that the problem that lucine or \nopen distro which is based on leucine \nare currently seeing \nis that we don't tie so while this stuff \nlives closely together and i'll get to \nthat more when you talk about charting \nwe never tie the vector index to a uh \nlsm3 segment that's very important \nbecause then we don't run into these \nkind of issues \nthat suddenly you have a lot of yeah \nsegmented vector indices that you need \nto somehow \neither combine or accept that they're \nslower \nso that was step two on the road map so \nthe next step \nthat we want to take is then um \nsharding so basically sharding or \npartitioning um i'm gonna explain what \nthat is and \ni'm gonna start with the motivation of \nwhy we would even want to do this \nonce you've defined that you want to do \nthis there are a couple of questions \nlike \nhow do you do it how do you partition \nhow do you \nonce you have those partitions how do \nyou distribute them among \nsomething basically like how do you sign \nownership how do you give someone \nownership of a partition \nand then once you've done all these \nthese things um yeah what are the \neffects of those \ndecisions like there are probably \ntrade-offs involved and how does that \naffect \nreal life data so the main motivation \nfor partitioning data is basically we \nwant to split \nsomething up and split it into smaller \nunits \nthat are basically the same as the \nlarger unit but just only contain \nparts of the data so basically instead \nof having one database \nwe would have sort of three smaller \ndatabases in a very very \nsimplistic way and and one of the \nmotivations for this is basically \nthat if you have those three charts they \nsince they're all self-contained \nthey don't have to live on a single \nserver anymore so you could for example \nput them on \non multiple servers um \nthe advantages of something basically of \npartitioning your data or \nsharding your data is yeah as i just \nsaid you can spread it \namong sort of not even it doesn't even \nhave to be servers it might also just be \nthat you have a machine that has a lot \nof cpu cores \nand that you're noticing that yeah okay \ni can i don't know use \nutilize 8 or maybe 16 cores efficiently \nbut with 32 cores i can't anymore and \nthen if someone \nfor whatever reason if you have a \nmachine with 128 cores then it might \nmake sense to just \ncharge your your workloads so that they \ncan use those more efficiently \nbut as we're sort of moving towards \nhorizontal scalability \nthe main motivation is probably going to \nbe that you want to distribute those \nshards onto various servers and it could \npotentially even be on different data \ncenters or something \nso basically as long as we decided that \nsomehow \nwe're partitioning the data we can then \nmove it into different places \nhowever it does not come without \ndisadvantages \nso the the first question basically that \nyou have if you have \nlet's say you have 100 charts and you \nwant to access \nsomething some object with an id uh john \ndoe one two three \nhow do you know where that is like maybe \nthere's rules somewhere maybe you have \nto test something i've also talked about \nplume filters before so potentially this \nis something that that could be used \num to to sort of figure it out where the \ndata could be lying \nbut essentially we need some sort of a \nrule and \nthe other thing is well right now in my \nexample i was looking for a key with id \nuh john doe one two three but what if \nyou don't know what you're looking for \nand we're a search engine so basically \nor vba is a search engine \nso basically we're dealing with a lot of \ncases where people don't know what \nthey're looking for \nso these are the kind of problems with \npartition data that \nneed to be solved so for partitioning in \ngeneral i have this very very simple \nexample \nwhich is just a modulo function and \nwe're using modulo 2 \nand there's this nice sort of stream of \nnumbers and some of them are already in \nbuckets and \nbasically what you can immediately see \nis like bucket zero contains the \neven numbers but one contains the odd \nnumbers so basically \nmy my hash function or my my \npartitioning function \nis a simple modulo two and then i'm just \nusing the remainder i'm gonna put it \nwith the remainder of zero i'm gonna put \nit into bucket zero and if the remainder \nis one \ni'm to put it into a bucket one there is \none advantage or one one very big \nadvantage \non such a distribution function \nif i import something or if i'm looking \nfor a key \ni can just use that exact same function \nand uh \nsort of immediately determine where i \nhave to look so \nmy stream here ends at 17 so let's say \ni'm looking for key \n18 don't know if it exists or not but \nwhat i do know is that \nif i just use this key the next one and \napply the module function \nsince the remainder is going to be zero \ni know that i have to look in bucket \nzero if it's not there \nthen um well then it just doesn't exist \nso this is this is one of the the \nadvantages however \nthere is also a problem and the problem \nis basically \nwell what if i say now \nthat instead of two buckets i would want \nto have three buckets \nso in this case the the easy thing to do \nwould be well let's say let's just turn \nthis modulo 2 into modulo 3 \nand all of a sudden the values that can \ncome out could be 0 \n1 or 2. but the problem is that you \ndon't start from scratch \nlike you might have already imported \ndata and now if we're looking at where \nthe data goes \num while zero modulo anything is always \nzero so that's going to stay in the same \nbucket \nbut as the numbers go up so um \nfor for one for example that also stays \nbut for two \nso uh two modulo three is now \ntwo that's the new bucket so two would \nhave to be moved even though it was \nsort of somewhere it needs to be moved \num \nif we go to three that's in bucket one \nso that was a different bucket \nbut modulo three is now uh zero so this \nalso needs to be moved into a bucket \nthat even existed already \nso basically what you're saying is if we \nhave such a function and if we ever \nchange how we partition it basically we \nneed to change the entire database and \nthat's a that's a problem because \nespecially if we have such a thing that \nthat's a problem for any distributed \ndatabase \nbut it's even more of a problem if we \nhave something such an hw index \nwhich is costly to to build so we need a \nsolution \nfor that problem now before we get into \nthat solution \njust in general a shard as i said \nis a self-contained sort of mini index \nit's a self-contained unit \nand um for us i said that we we have \nsort of this motivation to keep stuff \nthat belongs together very close \nso if we have some sort of a function we \ndetermine \num that something goes into chart two \nthen this chart contains everything it \ncontains the vector index the object \nthe inverted index basically everything \nis in in that chart \nand all of these charts together form \nthe index so \nto the user to the outside if they send \na query and \nwhether that query touches a single \nchart or all of the charts \nuh to the user it will just feel like \none index like they won't know \nwhether this was cert or maybe they will \nknow because it's contained in the \nresponse \num but the response will be the same it \nwill be the same as if this was all one \nindex \nand they don't care if it came from from \nyeah from one chart or from multiple \nshards and \nwhether these were local charts or \ncharts that were maybe on a different \nserver \nso that's the general idea that once we \nhave a sharded index \nthat um yeah basically an index is made \nup \nof those of of basically what currently \nis an index so these all have \nthe same capabilities of an index and \nthen of course \non a search we need to combine them but \non a vector search for example we have \nthe \nthe distance which we translate to a \ncertainty and that's something that we \ncan use to \nto sort them \nso now for that problem that we have \nabout changing the amount of of charts \num \nbasically that we saw with the with the \num module function \nand here this is something that we're \ncalling vba's virtual \ncharts and this is very very much \ninspired by cassandra's \nvirtual notes so the difference between \ncassandra \nand and vb8 is extender is not a search \nengine so \nit doesn't need sort of an index by \nspanning \nmultiple data points which we do so we \nneed something such as \nsuch as chart but we can still take some \nof the concepts that they do \nthat basically help us find a sort of \nsmart way of how to \ndistribute data in the chart so what i \nhave here \nin this this ring fashion is basically \nanother hashing function that that i \njust made up that doesn't exist \nthat produces values between 0 and \n11 999 the idea why \nwhy this odd numbers is basically \nbecause it's a ring and um if we \nwere to pretend this is a clock face \nthen we would immediately know sort of \nwhere \nthe three is and where the six is and \nthen it just because i thought like \nonly 12 numbers so that's a very bad \nhash function so i'm going to make it 12 \n000. \nso knowing this we can introduce \nsomething \nthat we could would call a virtual chart \nand as of now this doesn't change \nanything about \nsort of what we do we don't now go out \nand produce i don't know 100 charts \nbecause as we learned in the in the part \nabout \nh and sw we want as few large agents w \nuh index parts as we can so we can't \njust sort of \nmake these virtual uh shards or we can \nmake those virtual charts uh \nvery small but we can't make the actual \ncharts very small so \nthese virtual charts are basically now \nsort of randomly distributed \non this ring and each chart owns one \nsegment of this ring and the segment is \ndefined like the shard \nonly has an upper limit and it it owns \neverything sort of \nfrom the previous virtual shards upper \nlimit so if we take as an example the \nthe sort of green one around the the \n3000 mark here \nthat very roughly that the previous one \nends at like 2800 \nand the new one starts at 3200 \nsomething like that roughly so why do we \ndo \nall of this um basically \nthe the cool idea is now if we were to \nintroduce \none new virtual node so once we would \nadd a sorry one new virtual chart if we \nwere to add \na new shard then we'd probably add much \nmore than one but let's say \nfor the sake of argument that we would \nuh add \none new chart uh virtual chart \nand this virtual chart has the sort of \nupper limit of exactly three thousand \nthen what you would see is that it would \nbasically split \nthis green one here in half and why does \nthat matter \nthis is sort of as we see how we \ndistribute these virtual charts \ninto actual chart so a chart as we said \nwe need to have relatively few shards \nbecause we want to have large indexes \non there um that means a chart needs to \nsort of own virtual charts which \nessentially just \ntells us that if the sharding function \ntells us you would go into virtual chart \ni don't know something then we know \nbasically from a lookup table \nokay this is the actual chart in this \ncase one and just for the sake of \nsimplicity i've just decided that charts \nbasically own a specific color so shard \none would own the color blue \nchart two would on the color green and \nand we can go on \nand then if for for whatever reason we \nintroduce \nnew uh virtual chart we can cut them in \nhalf \nand basically now is sort of now is the \nmajor benefit if we look at those \nbuckets with a modular function \nlike even if we add or even though we \nadded new buckets \nnothing has to be moved across buckets \nthat already existed like \nyes if we sort of if we go from two to \nthree and we say we wanna populate three \nyes three will have to take something \naway from one and we'll have to take \nsomething away from two at some point \nthere's an equilibrium and it will stop \nbut it can never be the case that we \nhave to move something from one to two \nor from two to one \nso basically a lot less movement has to \nhappen \nif we ever change these these things \nand now you might be thinking sort of \nbefore i said well one of the problems \nof an hnsw index is that you can't \nreally \ncombine it or that you can't sort of \nmerge one into two \nso now i'm talking about potentially \nchanging the shards \nwon't we have that exact same problem \nand yes we do \nuh but there's there's two things that \nto keep in mind here \nso first of all this is a much more \nlong lift sort of process that is much \nmore rare \nif you import into a segment you will \nimport for a minute or import for a few \nminutes and you will already have \ni don't know probably 10 segments or \nsomething like that so that's a very \nvery common \nthing where this is a problem changing \nthe charts or \nchanging the clusters so most likely the \nreason why you would change the number \nof shards is because you've changed \nthe cluster size that's a much rarer \noccurrence and if it is \nthen it's also much more acceptable to \nmaybe have a background process there \nto to readjust so this is this is a \npretty rare process \nwhere the cost of sort of rebuilding an \nindex might be more acceptable \nthat's the one reason to justify this \nthe other one is that \nhmsw is basically just the one index \nthat we currently have \nin h in in v8 but we don't know what the \nfuture will bring \nmaybe there's a new index at some point \nwhere we say \noh wow the the cost to build this is \njust a tenth of that of hmsw \nmaking these sort of rebalancing acts uh \nmuch more \nfeasible so this is sort of a very core \ndecision \nin in the design and we want to be \nprepared \nto sort of not be not have the \nrestriction \nof never being able to to change hearts \nand there are some some databases out \nthere where basically \nyou can only select the the number of \nshards up front and then you can never \nchange it \nand we want to sort of be more the \ncassandra in this in this case \nwhere we can say yes um we are prepared \nto to scale dynamically and we are \nprepared \nto sort of do things that maybe you \ncouldn't predict already uh \nwhen you initially uh set up your \nyour cluster \nso when you partition like that so so \nbasically now we've talked about \nwhat happens or how you partition um but \nalso another question is what do you \npartition by \nso basically you need to take something \nto make that decision and in in \ntwo slides back on that or three slides \nback on that modulo function we were \njust \nusing numbers and numbers well i don't \nknow we could say that this was the id \nor this was the only property \num but basically you just need to make \nthat decision of what do you use to \npartition \nand what we have in our plans and i'm \nsaying sort of this is the \nthe first version because i think \nthere's there's definitely potential to \nalso extend that in the future \nuh at first what we want to go by is \njust the object id so everything in vb8 \nneeds to have every object needs to have \nan id \nand um using that id \nuh yeah we can sort of easily identify \nwe can easily identify that's the point \nof an id but we can access each object \nby an id \nand if the id is also the partitioning \nkey we basically know \nthat on each on each axis we have the \npartitioning key with us \nso for example why do you want to access \nsomething by id so on a search it \ndoesn't matter so much because the \nsearch we said that \neach chart is self-contained so if we \nuh sort of combine searches from \ndifferent charts \nthen it doesn't matter so much because \nlike the shard will already give us the \nwhole object so we just need to combine \nthe search \nbut there is a scenario where we need to \ndo those lookups by id \nand this is vba's cross-reference \nfeature so since we can't control \nif a cross-reference ends up on the same \nnode \nit could potentially be but it could \nalso not be the case \nwe need to sort of when we resolve a \ncross-reference we need to \nquickly grab that data and in this case \nit's much much more efficient if we \nknow if we can do the partitioning \ncalculation in front and if it will tell \nus okay \nthis particular id lives in this virtual \nchart which belongs to this actual chart \nwhich as we'll get there in the next \nstep belongs to maybe this node \nand that's much much nicer the \ndisadvantage \nis that if you have fuzzy information um \nyou will probably touch multiple shards \nbut that that's okay also if we \nif we look at replication in a second uh \nthat will basically show \nthat um yeah that there are ways around \nthis uh one of the ways of how we could \npotentially improve this in the future \nis if we just give that decision of how \nto make the partitioning if we just give \nthat to you the user because \nonly you really know what you're using \nvba for \nand let me give you an example so let's \nsay \num we're coming back here this is sort \nof how this all ties together if we're \ncoming back \nto vva's feature of using a \num a structured filter then you could \npotentially make the key that you're \nfiltering on or the property that you're \nfiltering on \nyou could make that your partitioning \nkey so for example a \nmade-up example in e-commerce use case \nand we're saying \nwe're partitioning by a field that is \nthe average \nshopping cart total so i don't know \nthese are these are past shopping carts \nand um the total is is what we're \npositioning by \nand we're not using now a hashing \nfunction such as murmur 3 \nwhich by the way is also inspired by \ncassandra i think it didn't even didn't \neven mention that but um \nit works well there so why not also use \nit in in our case \num and but we're using more of a range \nfunction \nwhere we're saying like if this is a low \nvalue it goes into partition one if it's \na mid value it goes into partition two \nif it's high volume it goes into \npartition three \nwhat's low mid high doesn't matter for \nnow so now if we know that our queries \nwill always set this kind of filter \nwe can basically triple the the search \ncapability of our search \nof our search engine because if we're \nsaying now give me the users that are \nsimilar to x and that's the the vector \nsearch part \nthat have a high average shopping cart \ntotal which would be expressed in the \nwhere filters such as i don't know where \nshopping cart total \nuh equals more than whatever the \nthreshold is for high \nthen potentially you could be in a \nsituation where this entire query \nis served by a single partition and that \nmeans that if your data is partitioned \nlet's say across 10 partitions \nwhich are on living on 10 nodes \nthen you could potentially sort of uh \nyeah \nsort of up your your intake or your \nthroughput by 10 because \neach of those nodes can conserve those \nqueries individually \nso in the partitioning strategy there \nthere's a lot of potential in in sort of \nreally \nhigh usage cases so i think it would be \nreally cool if we could open this up in \nthe future and just sort of let the user \ndefine how you want to partition but for \nnow just to get started \nwe just want to go with the the object \nid so that we have something to sort of \nevenly distribute the data \nthe major motivation of that um \nis really clear than in the in the next \nstep so so by the way step three \nis now under development so step one and \ntwo is basically released either as a \nfull release or a pre-release a step \nthree is currently under development and \ntherefore also \nthe next steps so now now that we have \nthose charts \num this is probably the part that we've \nbeen waiting for all the time is step \nthree like why do i have shards if i \ncan't do anything with them \nnow that we have them in step four we \nwant to distribute them \nacross notes and this will finally get \nus to the point \nwhere all of that load can be spread \nacross multiple nodes in a cluster \nso for example um if you have a data set \nthat you say like yeah with one ev8 node \nit just \ni know just it's too large for for what \nwe can \num yeah for for what it could handle or \nmaybe \nit's not too large for what it could \nhandle but maybe it's too large for for \nhow fast we could import it \nso there the benefit really is that in \nthis case you can now \num once we we are at step four you can \ndistribute that \namong multiple nodes in your in your \ncluster and cluster \nbeing the the key word here like this is \nthe first time that we can really talk \nabout a vb8 \ncluster cluster of sort of yeah where we \nhave horizontal scalability and and also \nwhere we see that horizontal scalability \nitself does not necessarily \nmean high availability so yes \nat this point the cluster is distributed \nuh but it's not necessarily fault \ntolerant yet or at least not a hundred \npercent because replication is still \nmissing at this point \nso if out of those three servers one \nwere to die \num then we could still serve two thirds \nof the data set \nwhich is sort of i don't know like it's \nbetter than nothing but it is not what \nwe want of course we want to be able to \nserve \nthe entire data set which is then \nwhat we will get in step five so so by \nthe way between step three and four \nthis is sort of i only have one slide \nonly saying now we distribute \nbut once we implement this uh there is a \nlot more things that we need to do \nthere's all the stuff in the background \nlike we need to make sure \nthat a schema changes for example that \nthey are fully consistent \nwhereas other stuff might not have the \nsame consistency requirements so \nbasically this is \nlarge enough from an implementation \nperspective to give it its own \nstep on the roadmap even um yeah \nif if sort of i talked a lot about step \nfour and then very little about \nuh oh sorry i talked a lot about step \nthree but very little about step four \nthe next step then and i think this is \nthis is really \nthis is where it starts to get get \nreally cool and really exciting \nthe next thing is then once we have a \nreplication \nand the way that we want to do so it's a \nreplication in general just means \nas you can also see in this this graphic \nso if you compare it to the previous one \neach node owned like one color the color \nof a chart here \nuh and then in the next step each node \nnow so here we would have a replication \nfactor of three \neach node now owns basically a copy \nof all three charts so in this setup of \njust three nodes \ntwo nodes could die and you would still \nbe able to serve the entire data set \nlike maybe not at the same throughput \nbecause you're \nyou're missing two machines but you can \nstill serve requests \nand and that's basically the the major \nbenefit of \nhaving replication and this is also the \npoint where we can say okay now it's \nhighly available \nsomething can happen a server can go \ndown and we can still \nbe able to serve the data set and um \nas always with these things the \nreplication factor is something that you \ncan control \nyou could potentially go to to some \nextreme measures where you have \nmaybe 10 nodes and every node contains a \ncopy of every chart then you would have \na super highly available setup like at \nthis point it would probably be more \nmore realistic than i don't know you \njust have an outage of the entire data \ncenter \nuh then that all 10 nodes go down \nindividually \nso this is sort of the decisions that \nyou can make basically what i'm saying \nis \nwe as as developers in vva and want to \ngive you that kind of control and just \nsort of design the system and you can \nuse it \num according to your your budget \nrequirements according to your \nslas according to your your availability \nrequirements \num there is also yes also i haven't \ntalked about the fact yet that \nthe way that we're planning uh the \nreplication thing is completely \nleaderless \nso basically this means that there is no \nsort of \nwrite-only notes and read-only notes but \nall \nnotes or all shards that are contained \non several notes \nare completely equal in that case and um \nthat means there's there's no \nbottlenecks \nbut there's also a potential for \nsomething uh that we've tried so far \nlike in the very beginning actually we \ndid an experiment with \na distributed uh server or \nbuilding up an hmsw vector index in a \ndistributed fashion \num which works surprisingly well like it \nneeds needs more experimentation \nbut there is a way of sort of spreading \nthat cost \nout of building the index by spreading \nthat out across multiple servers \nwithout then even ending up into \nmultiple charts so the idea is that you \nbasically just have a single chart that \nis replicated across servers \nbut still that those servers share the \ncost of building the index so this is a \nbit experimental \nbut i think there's a lot of a lot of \npotential but even even without that \nthat idea that the benefit of \nreplication i think is \nis pretty clear which is uh basically \nhigh availability to single or note \nfailures \nuh with regards to consistency uh the \nplan is to just have this eventually \nconsistent as we're seeing sort of \nall of our use cases tend to be in the \neither in the analytical space or in \nsort of \num yeah these typical search cases where \nyou replicate your data from another \ndata store \nso very eventual consistency is \nabsolutely fine \nif we ever see that we need more than \neventual consistency \nuh we could very easily or not easily \nbut we could definitely again sort of \ncopy from cassandra or be inspired by \ncassandra where they have a model of \ntunable consistency \num where the idea is that you can sort \nof control the cost of writing data \nwhere you could say \nuh i don't know i for example write with \na a quorum of nodes and then i also need \nto read for a form of nodes but then \nit's consistent or you could say \nthat i don't know i need a replication \nof at least x \ny or c for our right but for now that's \nnot really the plan \nit's something that that sort of our \narchitecture allows us to do \nif we see the need for it but for now \nbased on the cases that we're seeing um \nwe're not spending any resources on this \num so still in in \nin the idea of replication as i said \nbefore we really want to give you the \ncontrol of how you set up your your \ncluster \nand i just came up with two examples \nhere one is scenario \none um let's say that you have sort of \na workload where you import your data \nmaybe it's i don't know trained with a \nspecific \nmodel and you know that you retrain this \nevery 30 days \nso basically your typical workload is \nlike import once \nand then you you start querying which is \nsomething that we sometimes see but of \ncourse also you get is database and you \ncan mute hit it so it's \nin no way a restriction uh what you can \ndo then \nis um you could say okay \ni want to have one chart per node at \nimport time \nimport my data set and then once the \nimport is done \ni want to turn up my replication so that \nlet's say we have three nodes \nthat we end up with the picture on the \nright here where each node is able to \nhandle \num an entire request based on data that \nit has locally \nand the benefit of that besides high \navailability is that you have this this \nmassive throughput at query time because \neach \nnode can serve a search query across all \nshards \num in in isolation without needing a \nnetwork request and without talking to \nother nodes \nscenario two is something differently \nwhere you would say okay we have a lot \nof writes and we have a lot of reads \nhappening simultaneously and there's not \nan import phase in a query phase and in \nthis case \nyou could just say okay i want this \nhighly available from the beginning i \nwant replication from the beginning \nand then you'd have something that is \nhighly available at any time so \nbasically \nas soon as you yeah your cluster is live \nit will be highly available whereas in \nthe first one is a bit cheaper to build \nand a bit faster maybe \nbut then only it becomes highly \navailable once you you start turning on \nthe replication \nthe final step on the roadmap is then \ndynamic scaling so this is sort of the \nholy grail or maybe the holy grail is \nmulti-data center which is also \nsomething that that is \npossible with this architecture in \ngeneral um but sort of \nthe next part here is dynamic scaling \nwhere \nthe idea is that uh you can change the \ncluster size based on the demand that \nyou're seeing at runtime \nand this is also where we sort of come \nback where we then see the the benefit \nof \nthis ring thingy here with the virtual \nchart \nthat if you dynamically change your \ncluster and you can't predict \nhow you're going to change it then you \nmight also have these these sort of \nthese situations where you need to \nrebalance and potentially sort of \ncombine shards or split charts up \nand this is then where the virtual \ncharts will help in sort of \nminimizing the movement because yes sort \nof \nchanging something about an hsw index \nand potentially other \nvector index types in the future is \nexpensive but if we can at least \nminimize the the changes that have to be \ndone and then that becomes \na lot more efficient and that's sort of \nthe the uh \nyeah final part on that six step \nroad map where we've seen that one and \ntwo \num are complete and released three is in \nin under development and then the other \nsteps we're going to follow \nso that is basically the overview \ni've been talking for for quite some \ntime let me know if you have any \nquestions \nso that's uh thanks session \nthat's a lot to process so i'm curious \nto hear if there are any any questions \nalso there as well yeah exactly that was \nalso one of the the motivations of \nsaying we need to we need to record this \nbecause \nthere is a lot of a lot of stuff crammed \ninto this \nit was almost an hour wow but \nlet me try to figure out how i can exit \nviews that i can also \nsee you there we go and i think i need \nto stop presenting \nyeah so uh so this \nthis was great i think it it gives us an \nidea of what can be done \ni think we're still in experimentation \nmode so \nuh some of the some of the practical \nconsiderations \nuh that we're having when we when we're \ntrying to implement use cases was \nso so the first one is okay when \nwe didn't initially look at it as a data \nstore as the database \nright so persistent storage wasn't \nat the top of our mind right like okay \nand and uh \nit was more response times \nfor your uh for your for your reads \nright right like \nso the right wasn't such a big \nfactor but it was still a big \nproblem if you're doing the one-off \nmigration \nright so i wanted to get my data from \nwherever \nmy current person's storage is into into \nvv8 right and and that was a \nthat was a big uh that was a bottleneck \nright like you know the speed with which \nyou could do that one-off migration \nright so we were looking at that uh uh \nalone rightly \nand for me right like once i had done \nthat then \nthe additional so and then right when \ni'm adding objects directly to the \nuh to the instance it's not a problem \nbecause it's not \nyou know in future right like you know \nthat load might increase and then it \nmight become a problem \nbut you don't you don't see that when we \nare \nwhen you're using it currently right so \nthat's that's that's one thing \nthe second is the \nthe availability is one thing but also \nright like in a recovery you know rp \nrpo right like you know sort of what \nhappens if i lose some data \nhave i got backup how do i recover right \nlike you know if i'm using this \nas my database right so that one \nthat was a that was a that was something \nat the back of my mind to say right like \nyou know \nto prevent me from okay can i use it as \na production \ndatabase right so for me rightly can i \nsay okay \nmy uh you know um what i had in mind was \nuse something like cassandra neo4j for \nmy persistent storage \nuh but you but you realize that right \nlike you know that's not necessary \nif you're using vv8 as the database \nright \nuh so that's that's one thing \nand i think depending on the use case \nthe characteristics will differ right \nlike you know we can only we can \nprobably like you know sort of \nexperience that only when we try it and \nsee what happens \nbut that's when right like you know the \nwe need that flexibility \nright do you need more sharding so \nobviously i want uh horizontal \nscalability \nbut uh my uh \ni might just write like you can have a \none-off big migration load \nand then write like you know sort of my \nmy ongoing right like you know sort of \nload for adding objects might not \nbe that high right so i might need a \ndifferent solution to \nto get my data on one time into into \nuh to migrate it onto the v8 instance \nand then ongoing that that wouldn't be a \nproblem so uh \nthe the flexibility right looking at \nthat that's coming \nwill be will be great um \nand and and of course right like you \nknow sort of the um \navailability for both of those \nright-clicking and i think it's it it's \nfor us to see right look at how we can \ntweak it whether we want faster response \ntimes \nright or right like you know sort of as \nyou are if you've got \nvery less road and you want to write \nlike you know sort of \nconfigure it pretty heavily for \nfaster response times that's that that \nflexibility right like it will be great \ni said sorry right click and i think \ni've taken too much of the time because \nno no \nit's very cool to to hear sort of how \nhow all this abstract stuff how this \nthis ties into actual use cases and \nespecially \nsort of two takeaways for me is is one \nsort of the \num it might not be clear to everyone \nthat vvat really is a database and that \nthat \nthere might be something else that you \nneed or maybe \nyeah sort of in an experimental mode it \nmight also make sense to to sort of \nstart storing the data or to still have \nthe data somewhere else or \nuntil you figure it out how you want to \nuse vvat and then you can throw away \ninstances and not not worry so much \nbut in the end sort of in that \nproduction scenario it's really cool \nthat \nthe data can be be safe there and \nthe second one yeah i'm sort of this \nthis \nuh import heavy load this is also \nsomething that i've thought about for \ncases where \nonce we have the really dynamic \nscalability you could produce a \nridiculously large \ncluster and and just sort of run it only \nfor maybe a day \nand and like let's say uh \nif you have a machine that that's 30 \ntimes as much as the machine that you \nend up in \nin the end but you run it for just one \nday then it costs you basically one \nmonth of serving the data in production \nand this kind of flexibility i think \nthis is going to be \ngoing to be really cool yeah question \nabout that as well uh \nso do i understand correctly that you're \nbasically saying that your \nassumption was that you could use with \nit just for the search functionality but \nnot \nas a persistent data store as well do i \nunderstand that correctly \nyeah so i i wasn't um \nyou know i i wasn't seeing that um \nyou know basically like you know the \nhorizontal scalability that you get and \nand the \nthe flexibility of using distributed \nstorage right like you know so \nso typically like you know sort of you \nwhat \nthe the way we do is we we try so we \nwe plan separately for compute and \nstorage right like you know sort of in \nany \ncloud deployments and right-clicking on \nthat storage itself is a big \ncost that we're right like you know sort \nof there's a there's a whole uh \ncapacity management archival blah blah \nblah right like you know sort of all of \nthat and rpo \nobjectives connected to that right the \nbackup recovery all that connected to \nthat \nuh whereas right like you know \navailability is something different \nright like you know it's fine if i \nit's one thing if right like you know if \ni if if the \nsite goes down right click you know for \nsome time and then it comes up right \nlike instead of it's \nit's fine that might be okay from an sla \npoint of view but if i lose data \nif something gets corrupted right like \nyou know then my rpo \nso rto and rpo are the two holy grails \nof \nenterprise sls right so and and \nwe treat each one of that differently so \ni was fine with the \nuh rto stuff and and it it was fine \nright like another of the the kind of \nuse cases that i'm i'm guessing \num might not write like a make a \nbusiness impact if the site is \ndown for a read for for a certain period \nof time right \nbut if i'm going to use it as a \npersistent storage i don't want to get \nto i want to make sure because this is \nmy \nwhere my master data is stored right so \nwhich is why right like you know sort of \ntill now \nin at least in the experimentation it \nwas always okay i can i can spin up a \ncluster \nmigrate the data right uh \ncheck out the semantic search and do all \nthat but then right click it i'm fine if \nthat goes down \ni import it again right or and \nfor now right like once i import it uh \nthe import is pretty painful \njust now because of the of the time and \nbecause of the \namount of data for the one-time input \nbut \nonce it's on the vv8 instance then \nit is just right-clicking on sort of \nthose one-off objects that i add right \nso \ntypically like you know sort of what \ni'll do is i'll i'll set up some \nmessaging system some event based \nsomething that right like you know that \nsays okay fine yeah every time \na user gets added just go and put it \ninto right like you know sort of and \ncreate that object there so that's not a \nbig problem till \nand we've not faced that load yet but \nthat becomes a problem but that's not a \nbig problem just now right \nbut if i am to say right like i'll i'll \nneed to trust vv8 \nwith my production data and that's the \ndata store and all my \nbackup recovery rpo will be \ntied into that then that you know it's \nso whatever you presented today gives \nthat confidence but it wasn't there \nbefore \nnice nice thank you yeah that was \ndefinitely one of the goals to just sort \nof convey that we're we're \ntaking these kind of things very very \nseriously \nand of course something that that \na decision that i can't make for for \npeople that use vba \nis always like do you use vb8 as your \nonly database or is there a case \nwhere you have something like we're not \nsaying that just because vv8 \nis a database that you should never use \nanother database it really \nneeds to fit the the use case so for \nexample i don't know if you have \nuh very transactional data then it it \nprobably makes more sense if you have a \ntransactional data store \nand then replicate into vba so very \nsimilar as you would today maybe see in \nin sort of a hybrid setup of the \ncassandra and then \nusing maybe an elastic search or \nsomething so that's also very much \npossible with with vv8 and something \nthat just needs to be done \ndecided on it on a case by case basis \ncorrect yeah yeah i think yeah makes \nsense and and \nprobably like you know sort of in that \ncase we just need to think of right like \nyou know sort of how we \nreplicate and you know if i've \nbuilt my knowledge graph for my \nenterprise on vv8 \nand i don't want to lose and it's the \nsame amount of data \nsomewhere else then yeah yeah and of \ncourse also backups play play roles or \nbesides that the sort of live \nreplication you can also just do do sort \nof old school \nbackups exactly which we've by the way \njust implemented in the \nuh in the wcs so in the vba cloud \nservice if you use the the hosted uh \nvb8 service okay i think from the \nstandard tier on \nuh everything they're just sort of \nsnapshots that are that are currently \nreplaced \nand you can restore snapshots and it \nit's a sort of very simple backup system \nfor now \num the idea is that in the future we \ncould have incremental backups and all \nthat that kind of stuff \num but just in general it's also a nice \nproof of concept of just \nhaving yeah how do you do backups with \nwith vba and of course not just how do \nyou backups but how good is the backup \nif you never train the restore process \nbut sort of do the the whole the whole \nintune thing um yeah which we we have \nthere as well and \ni think our documentation is maybe not \nup to speed yet with regards to to what \nto do on on backups and \nlibrary stores but uh yeah it's a good \npoint and we'll definitely also look \ninto it \nokay thank you okay thanks \na lot for for your feedback was really \nreally cool also it's it's it's always \nso cool to just \nget that kind of connection just see vva \nbeing used and \nand see what the pain points are see \nwhat the the the cool things are and \njust \ni don't know just in general to hear \nthat vivian of course it's being used \nbut \nlike to put a face to to a user is very \nvery cool \nso thank you very much for for sharing \nas well \ncool thank you i think it's like because \nwe went like \nalmost 10 10 minutes over so \num there's a few more things hm may be \nnice to mention \nbecause i think you haven't mentioned \nany uh \nexpected or estimated timelines have you \njust just ballpark timelines \nyeah yeah yeah i thought i thought i \ncould get away with it \nno so we so we do have a a sort of um \none date on the timeline that that i \nthink that's also on the website \nwhere we said the the end of q3 so \nbasically by the end of \nseptember um is where we sort of \nyeah aim for for this this timeline \nwhich definitely means \num yeah it needs to be horizontally \nscalable and i'm pretty sure it also \nit will also have replication in it um i \ndon't know if dynamic scaling \nmight be in that so so maybe not but \nsort of the the target point that we \nreally say like is \nby the end of september we want to be at \nthe i think it was step five out of six \nwhere \nwhere uh replication is in and then see \nwhere it goes maybe also on dynamic \nscaling \nso this is pretty pretty soon uh already \nwhich \ni like from a from a feature perspective \nwhich every time i check the calendar \nthing from an implementation perspective \nwell where's the time gone but i mean \nwe're we're not starting from scratch \nwhere \nwe've already just released step two of \nthat six step pipeline \ncool thank you so much and also thank \nyou for your question \num i think we're gonna wrap up and so \nwe'll uh publish this also on on youtube \nbecause \nuh you'll see it on our slack channel \netc and on twitter people asking for \nthis so \nthey can they have enough material \ninstead of watching a movie they can \nwatch this \nthe architecture thank you so much \neverybody \nand um well i hope yeah thanks for for \njoining \nalso for those that have already left \nthere's a couple of people that left \nlike right right at \nthe one hour mark sorry for using up all \nthe time \nand thanks for staying \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Meetup June \u2013\u00a0Architecture
