{"text": "Welcome to Weaviate Air - Weaviate's live discussion and knowledge panel! Thanks for tuning in to this episode featuring a ... \noh I think we're live yeah \nwelcome welcome to this viviate air uh \nit's episode number 11. uh double one \nthis is super exciting \num we kind of had a little confusion \nbecause I thought the Zen will kick it \nout but I can do it you know like you \nall used to this face you know and \nmaking a lot of noise \num so today is going to be really \nawesome we have loads of great people on \nthe call uh we have a special guest \nAhmed from B1 who's going to do a really \ncool demo of something that he built \nwith with it but also \num his the whole business that he's \nbuilding is super exciting so I don't \nwant to spoil it all just yet but it's \ngoing to be super exciting \num of course we have two new starters \npeople that just joined with it recently \nso we have Mario and Duda they will say \nhi to you very soon and tell you what's \nwhat and of course uh Abdel comes to us \nto talk to us about some new indexing uh \nideas and optimizations in viviate this \nis really exciting writing stuff you \nwill get quite a bit technical but it \nwill be inclusive for everyone and of \ncourse the usual suspect Zen and JP well \nand me \num so this is this should be good so uh \nZen how do we run it what's up yeah so I \nwant to start off with uh our our main \nguest today Ahmed so welcome to the show \num thanks for having me yeah it's gonna \nbe awesome I'm looking forward at your \ndemo maybe we can start off by uh \nintroducing you uh to the audience uh \nhere at weviate \nyeah sure I'm I'm the founder and CEO of \nB1 so it's a French startup that helps \norganizations navigate through large \namounts of unstructured data \nand I remember last time with uh \nSebastian we had a great uh demo during \nthe the Intel Dev Summit \nuh and today is gonna be uh \nare like different \nbut uh you know maybe I will talk about \nthat later \nokay yeah \nawesome thank you \nI think so one of the great things that \nI liked about your \num your platform was that you showed the \ndemo in the uh in the Intel Summit but \noutside of that you've got a lot of \nother functionality as well right you \nyou showed me the entire pipeline \num that you use \ncan you talk a little bit more about \nthat before we get into the demo new and \nimproved yeah sure \num \num I think when you uh approach AI uh uh \nin the Enterprise world uh \nyou can just like talk about text only \nuh you need to take into accounts like \nimages uh videos uh audio and other \nmodalities and most of the hype right \nnow is around text and I do believe that \nwe need to include other modalities as \nwell to have like a truly functional and \nuseful product and this is why \nwe have a full workflow to just automate \nthe the building of a an own AI for \nEnterprises which means that an \nEnterprise can come with its data and \nthen get out with like a fully \nfunctional AI that is \num specialized uh in its domain and for \nobvious reasons uh for competitiveness \nfor Innovation and the this AI that we \nbuilt for our Enterprises keep learning \nfrom new data and that was like the the \nthe the main issue that we are solving \ntrying to solve \nyeah it's really interesting because \nthere's this whole debate going on right \nnow in the AI Community where people are \nsaying that language is enough to get us \nto AGI and they believe like GPT \n56789 eventually will get to GPT AGI \num but then there's this other school of \nthought which you probably agree with \nthat you can't get to AGI without \nmultimodal reasoning right it's not um \nenough to just be a master of language \nyou have to understand other modalities \nlike humans do \num to be able to to be able to reach \nthis kind of barrier of AGI \nyeah absolutely I mean uh \nhere we are talking but uh your face \nexpressions are important \nuh you know whatever happens outside of \nlike language is really important so I \nmean uh visual is a I think is much more \nimportant than text only so we tend to \ncombine that with language understanding \nto have a kind of like \num a very good understanding of our \nwords because I I really believe that \nmany others believe that text only is is \nis not enough we are making progress \ntoward the AGI but still I mean I've \nseen some some research around like \nmilitary modalities where you have like \ndepth for example this is something that \nwe \num we are like working on but it's it's \nreally tough uh to uh to to just so uh \nmake machines learn about that uh \nand there are a lot of other like uh \nmodalities that could be really useful \nto achieve that that AGI but text only \nis of course just a the beginning and \nyou know we are all grateful to GPT to \nyeah \num to to to have made that you know \npossible and accessible to everyone so \nthis is just the beginning \nbecause I think even even those \ncompanies so if you look at Google Palm \nuh openai they're adding multi-modality \nto the regenerative uh setups as well \num the other interesting thing \num is that there's this Paradox and \nmorvix Paradox which says that a lot of \nthe things that we think are very \ndifficult are actually easy to compute \nso um like identifying or picking out \nimages uh like segmenting a radiology \nimage we think it's very difficult \ncomputers can do it \num like labeling thousands of images in \na second we think it's very difficult \nbut computers can do it but a lot of the \nthings that we take for granted like \nwhen a when a child picks up a ball and \nthen throws it we can't really automate \nthat so um that's where multi-modality I \nthink comes in right because in order to \na simple Act of throwing a ball you have \nto be able to control \na lot of other modalities to to action \nthat \nyeah if we uh I mean if we make \nadvancements towards \num uh understanding complex things like \nyou know \num uh touch and you know feelings and \nother other modalities that we are \nliving with like on a daily basis that \nthat that could be a great achievement \nbut \nfrom our perspective if we manage to \ndeal with text images videos and \nprobably audio that that that could be \nlike really yeah \ngood advancements and of course I mean \nnot someday \num when we see the the rapid uh race \ntowards like AGI I think in less than \nfive five years we'll see like systems \nthat could understand the world as \nas we humans do and you know probably uh \nhelp us be more like efficient and \namplify our intelligence this is this is \nat least our goal that we want this to \nto enable humans with the \nuh like uh more intelligence and more uh \nanalytics and you know be able to act \nlike an assistant greater than replacing \nyou know domain expertise which I \nbelieve it's not yet there yeah \nso you were last time at you you showed \nme a great demo and I it got me all \nhyped and then I shared that demo \num in some of my other talks and then \nyou mentioned that you have a new and \nimproved demo so you you haven't told me \nanything else and I tried to get some \ndetails but it's been on the hush hush \nso let's let's go into that demo \num if you're ready so let me share your \nscreen on the \non the main screen here okay cool yeah \nso as the light just see it's a simple \ninterface uh like a kind of GPT \ninterface and uh today I'll be switching \nto two different domains which are \nfinancial services and real estate \nuh Financial Services because I I used \nto work uh in that domain like for 15 16 \nyears so \num I've seen a lot of Enterprises \nstruggle with \num you know financial analysis and all \nthe legal documents all the disclaimers \nyou know all that kind of reports and \neasier reports so I I thought that \nhaving a system that could like \nspecialize in financial services that \nthat could be cool and also I wanted to \nshow like a demo about real estate \nbecause this is a kind of like domain \nthat hasn't been disrupted yet \num by AI \nand so yeah let me start \nso this is a guy that I like very very \nmuch Warren Buffett and he's really like \num \ngives like with wisdom advices so \num \nprobably sometimes when you have like a \ntwo or three hours video you don't want \nlike to to watch the whole whole video \nyou just want to get answers for \nspecific like questions so this is uh \nsomething we are working on \nand let me show you what what we get in \nterms of results so I just copy the \nvideo URL \nI just push it here \nand I process that video \nand once it's processed I can start \nasking questions so I I'm gonna ask \nquestions to uh warrant with it so \nshould we go to a college to be \nsuccessful because he was talking about \nsuccess so I guess \nuh this could be related \nand so the system will understand what \nhas been said during like the the \ninterview so the answer is according to \nWarren Buffett going to college is not \nnecessary for everyone this is probably \nnot an advice to follow \nuh for most of the bill so he believes \nthat the best investment one can make is \non oneself and you know a lot of a lot \nof wisdom and probably I can ask it you \nknow what are the \nuh biggest mistakes uh in investing \nand so it goes on like the biggest \nmistakes people make when investing \naccording to Warren Buffett are trying \nto trade too frequently and not \nrealizing etc etc so this was like uh \nthe kind of videos that you you want to \nto get answers for but probably not \nwilling to spend like one hour or two \nhours listening to the full uh the full \nvideo \nanother \nuse case for financial analysts is to be \nable to follow like earning calls or uh \nlike profit warnings and all the \ncandidate kind of like uh \nevents that happens in the financial \nmarkets so similarly I mean I'm gonna uh \nadd a new video and process it \nand probably start asking some some \nquestions \nuh like how is \ninterest rates uh impacting stocks \nand it's it's gonna just like understand \nwhat has been said in the in the video \nand give me uh answers this is by the \nway running on Intel uh for Generation \nCPUs which are really powerful and \nsuitable for that kind of of use cases \nso \num yeah one thing to mention is that \noutside of the context of the video the \nthe the solution doesn't answer so if \nyou ask it for example what do you want \nto have for dinner or for lunch or \nshould I go out tonight it's it's not \ngonna answer it needs to be in the \ncontext of of uh of the video \nI'm not going to read like all the of \nthe examples but I I see in video for \nexample here and I'd like to know more \nuh so what does the video uh says about \nIndia \nso again I mean you don't need to watch \nthe whole video so the video suggest \nthat in video expected to have a good \nquarter this is the answer that I was \nlooking for \num \nso uh another use case is like a full \ninterview of CEOs and very often uh you \nhave some tips for financial analysts \nthat comes out of these interviews and \num a lot of people are watching those \ninterviews especially for like CNBC or \nother other big Brands and \num \nso I'm gonna take this one \nand start another processing \nso how did I envidia uh Grew From \nuh gaming to AI so again I don't want to \nwatch the full video I just want to \nanswer because I mean how come like in \nvideo is known for gaming and now it's \nlike \nuh the the leader in in \nproviding like hardware for for for AI \nand this is like the full story \nso 2006 and you know Nvidia released the \nsoftware toolkit uh called Huda and you \njust uh have like the answers to uh to \nyour question so now comes in the most \ninteresting piece which is the \nmultimodalities so \num \num I was wondering if Nvidia is uh \nuh billionaire chips in in the US or \nsomewhere else so uh what's the \nrelationship between \nJensen and gsmc I'm sorry for the J \nand so it's gonna answer like my \nquestion so Jensen the founder of uh NCO \nof Nvidia relies on Taiwan jcmc to \nmanufacture nearly all Nvidia chips but \num yeah I want to hear it so I just \nshowed the videos \nand I don't know if you hear the sound \nof the video but here the video starts \nwhere uh Jensen's is still the founder \nof tcmc that it was his his hero \nuh \nso again mixing modalities makes it like \nmore fun and more efficient to \nunderstand \num I said I was talking about like I was \ngoing to talk about financial services \nbut also \num real estate and I here we are going \nto visit like uh mega mansion in Dubai \nuh it's actually a 60 million so I'm \nexpecting a lot from this mention \nand uh here we go uh so I'm gonna \nprocess this video so this video is like \n39 minutes \num full of images and you know some \ninteresting stuff \nis that a tour of your house Amit I wish \nso \num the video is processed and let's like \nuh let's say I'm a real estate agent and \nI I'd like to look for a beautiful house \nfor my clients and I don't want to see \nall of them and I just want to see uh \nyou know the good answers for uh for \nsome of like the the things that matters \nto my clients \nand so I'm gonna ask first to summarize \nthe video so the video is a tour of \nluxurious mega mansion in Dubai and you \nknow it describes like the dimension but \nI can go further and say uh lists all \nuh amenities \nand so here we get like a summary of all \namenities but I like to cook and the \nkitchen is really important to me so um \nI'd like to \nof my clients \nso I'd like to see uh the kitchen \nand so it's going to describe a little \nbit like the kitchen but also uh \nso yes I can show you the kitchen the \nkitchen is in this property super modern \nhas stunning marble control yeah that's \nthat's really nice so I'd like to see it \nso uh here \nso this is a very very nice it's okay \nequipped yeah uh kitchen so this is \nvalidated but in Dubai you know that \npeople don't work a lot they use their \ncar and they have like very luxurious \ncars so I'm wondering if there is any uh \nluxurious car or probably a Bugatti in \nthe garage \nfor 60 million I expect to have like a \nBugatti \nso let's see what the system \nuh answers for that oh yeah this is a \nBugatti diesel but you know I know the \nBugatti Chiron that's DeVos something \nthat I don't really know so let's see it \nhere \nI can see where we meet later on \ncarbon fiber and all that kind of stuff \nin our full description and I don't lose \ntime I just get right where my answer is \ncan you ask it like how many sports car \nsports cars you saw I think there are a \nfew Ferraris there uh \nuh Sports \nno problem \nyeah we can see it's like in the \ntimeline \nbut I've already seen like this this \nvideo I think there are a bunch of like \nFerraris and the Bugatti and you know \nuh so yeah \nPorsche 918 uh post GT2 a Ferrari Monza \nuh Ferrari for \nfive eight yeah so a lot of luxurious \ncars actually as you can just you know \nso this this was like the mustacherous \ncar \namount of \nexcellent this is an amazing demo I love \nit I like I like how there was this \ntransition from like you are talking to \nthis like \num yeah to to the AI kind of like hey go \nanalyze this video and I'll ask you a \nbunch of questions and then you go like \noh this is interesting I want to \nactually listen to that part for myself \num that's like that's so super cool \nbecause then yeah you could it could be \na long video right like you're only \ninteresting that one bit but you don't \nremember what you want yeah I mean in in \n20 years ago I I don't think I had the \ncamera in my in my phone now I have \nthree cameras in single phone so you can \nimagine that a lot of people are \nshooting camera like videos and those \nvideos end up probably uh in the \ninternet and \nfrom what I have read \num like 83 percent of all uh internet \ntraffic is is coming from videos so uh \nwe thought it could be like cool to have \na tool to to be able like to to to fetch \nthose videos and you know understand \nwhat's what's being said and uh and get \nextract some value from those videos \nwithout spending too much time on it \ntotally I mean actually the the great \nuse case is we be there we could um at \nthe end actually drop a link to we be \nthere and start asking questions right \nyeah and I I can I can add something I \nmean with the performance like combined \nuh like the the combining like the the \npower of the interval uh CPUs and gpus \nand also the performance of the uh our \nfavorite \ndatabase which is very weird uh I I \nthink we can achieve real-time analysis \non videos \nnice hey so we've got a question from uh \nfrom the audience actually from our CTO \num so lovediff join late forgive me if \nyou explained this initially are the \nvideos frames uh transcribed stored as \nembeddings how does it find the right \ntime in the video \nyes that's right I mean we we store \nevery modality as embeddings uh in wheel \nGates and we have uh like some \ntechniques and algorithms that's combine \nthose like modalities to be able to uh \nfind the right moment uh find the right \ninformation to show and you know it's \nall about uh relevance we don't want to \nhave multiple results but have like the \nmass meaningful result and yeah \neverything is stored as embeddings and \nwe view it is is kind of like Central to \nwhat we do because uh we need \nperformance we don't want to wait too \nmuch for queries and uh when you deal \nwith videos you deal with a lot of uh \ninformation so uh one there is only I \nthink one way to do it is is using a \nvector database and with it is is our \nknowledge that the best one \nthank you \nyeah one one follow-up question to this \nso one so a great demo but one part of \nyour demo \num kind of piqued my interest so and \nthis is something different \num when you search for uh how is Jensen \nrelated to tsmc and like I have an \nunderstanding of how it can generate an \nanswer but the timestamp also went to \nthe part of the video where Jensen was \ntalking about tsmc \num the video doesn't show that he's \ntalking about tsmc it's in the audio so \ndo you guys have audio in there as well \nnow yeah as I said I mean we we work \nwith a lot of modalities we just store \nthem all and we have like our system \njust finding out what's what's what's \nthe best uh thing to show uh there are \nlet me give you an example like you are \ndriving and uh you hear music like uh I \ndon't know your favorite music \nuh if we translate that in a video you \nwould see yourself like driving and on \nthe background having like some music \nthis is not really related \nand so if we question that video uh then \nwe need to ensure that what we get as an \nanswer wouldn't include like the \nbackground music even if it's nice so \nthere are a lot of like playing with \nmodalities just uh is it's not just like \nabout audio but uh but it's it's more \nthan that it's understanding what's \nwhat's meaningful for the users at the \nend and not trying to replicate 100 how \nthe brain works \num but just trying to find like useful \nuse cases that could could amplify like \nthe human intelligence and and let us \nlike uh interact with those videos in a \nsimilar swine \nthat's so interesting so you've got \nyou've actually got multiple modalities \nof search that are going in in the \nbackground I guess the the next question \nand perhaps this this will be the last \nquestion for me is \num you're doing image search in the \nbackground text search audio search \ncan you tell us how you decide which one \nis of the most important to answer any \none question so when when you search \nabout tsmc the audio search is important \nbut when you search about Bugatti the um \nobviously the image search that's \nshowing the Bugatti is important so how \ndo you \nsay that audio is important now but now \nimage is important or something else is \nimportant yeah yeah I mean you ask the \nuh or probably Sebastian I don't know I \ndon't remember you asked you know uh how \nhow we deal with with such such you know \nuh modalities uh we have like a data \nplatform that we use to provide human \nfeedback and this human feedback is used \nto be able to retrain the model and have \nlike an active learning Loop to be able \nto to try to figure out which like uh \nmodality is best suited for for the \nanswers so it's it's probably working \nthe same way as uh error.chef \nand you know \nthe more people will use the system the \nmore the system gets better in defining \nwhat's important and what's not uh while \ngetting their their answers \nso the answer is not straightforward but \nyou know it's kind of like \nuh reinforcement learning you know and \nprobably from a country to another \nthings might like change and so we're \njust trying to figure out how best we \ncan do that especially that we need to \nwe have like some AI safety concerns uh \nbecause the prompt is is free so uh you \ncan you can ask whatever question uh you \nyou'd like but we need to ensure that \nthe answers are not biased and they \ndon't contain like harmful content and \nall that kind of stuff so there's a lot \nof work to do in that in that regard to \nensure that these systems are safe for \nuh like a larger audience for now we are \nfocusing on the Enterprise use but \nprobably later \nwe want this system to be like useful \nfor for everyone and for that we need to \nwe have some additional steps to go \nthrough \nsuper interesting thank you for the demo \nI'm confusing of modalities is super \namazing yeah go ahead JP sorry I'm just \nsorry I'm sorry to button um if I were \nto learn more about you know B1 then \nuh and whatnot like what's the best \nplace to go obviously this is locally \nhosted um demo so they go to the website \nuh you know give your phone call that I \ndon't know what do they do yeah for now \nwe are targeting like \num Enterprises uh \nbecause we we believe that this kind of \nsystems multi-modal systems are are more \nuseful to to Enterprises for now and so \nyeah you can go to the website or I can \nleave my my \ndetails uh you know and we of course we \nare happy to to collaborate on any \nprojects that is related to to this kind \nof like research and of course I didn't \nshow one interesting part is when you \nmix actually videos with documents \nuh and this is really interesting \nbecause you get especially Financial \nServices you get a lot of documents so \nyou want to send ESG reports and have an \ninterview at the same time and see if \nthere is any difference if like the the \nvalues of the company \nis really translated into this these \nreports so there are a lot of use cases \nbut I see those use cases for now in the \nEnterprise world and probably we'll find \nout if if there are other use cases it \ncould be applied to \nlike larger audience \nawesome thank you for that that was that \nwas great \nall right so it's it's going to be tough \nto top that honestly and it's going to \nbe very difficult is that what you're \nsaying yeah yeah the best for the \nbeginning and then there's nothing \nbetter than that \nno just okay bye \n[Laughter] \nall right so uh next up um probably \nnoticed um Sebastian introduced Marion \nand Duda so new new members to the team \nand yeah so let's hear a little bit \nabout you let's introduce you to the \nwevia community and yeah \nyeah thank you thank you then hi welcome \neveryone \num um I'm Marion I newly joined the gate \nas a community manager and I must say uh \nAhmed I'm I was really Amazed by that \num by that um demo and I probably can't \ntop it but I just saw throughout the \nwhole demo oh my gosh how would that \nmake my life more easier because we just \nconducted user Community interviews \nand I actually \num you know recorded some of the \nfeedback \num our community members had and it \nwould be so awesome right to and and I \nalso took a lot of notes on paper and it \nwould be so awesome to kind of combine \nthese documents together with um what \nhas been said and just ask the question \nyou know did they find \num did they find our documentation \nhelpful right and then get it from the \ncontext that would be amazing so yeah \nand that is but that is a great bridge \nto what I wanted to say \num I joined recently as I said and um \nfor us Community matters that's why I'm \nhere and I want to spread you know joy \nand happiness and really kindness into \nour community \nand I also want our community members to \nbe valued and to get the value out of \nviviate right so that's why we are \nstarting with initiative where we go out \nto our community members and ask them \nabout you know our documentation new \nfeatures different uh use cases in Vivid \nand just ask them how they are you know \nhow they are finding their Wows and \ntheir challenges and learn from their \nfeedback and just get better and make it \nmake make it more more awesome maybe a \nlittle bit more about myself I live \nclose to Berlin so \num I'm going to be around in a couple of \nevents \num around here in Berlin um starting \nfrom now on so keep your eyes open and \num I'm also going to be at a lot of \nmeetups so you can meet me in person and \nhopefully the rest of the team as well \nand \num I will also be in this Community \nhanging hanging out with the vv8 fans \nand everyone else and that \nthe perfect time for Duda introduce \nhimself \nhello everybody I'm dude I'm based here \nin Brazil and just as Marion but a \nlittle bit early I also joined the \nreview gate and it's been a very fun \nride so far uh learning a lot of course \nas a a very full of potential uh uh tool \nthat can be used to amazing stuff just \nlike Ahmed showed us and I'll be I am \nthe Community Technical manager uh \nsupport uh so I'll be always there on \nthe on the forums and on also on the \nslack and on the documentation also with \nthe help of GP and Zayn and so whatever \nthing that you need in if I am able to \nsolve it and if I if I don't I also will \nbring data to our team so it's a \npleasure to be here and I hope to see \nyou around there on the on the forums or \nhours like so please feel uh more than \ninvited to join us there \nthank you \nawesome thank you Mary absolutely so \ngreat to have you all here you know it's \nnice to grow the family the team is \ngrowing the team is growing \nso now we set the stage for the next \npresent next fixing right yeah \nall right so next up \ngot Sebastian talking about what are you \ntalking about Sebastian \noh yeah I wanted to talk to you all \nabout online workshops so it's it's \npretty cool because both use and njt \nhave been running workers for uh for a \nlittle while already \num but in order to find them it was a \nlittle bit tricky in the past because \nyou kind of have to find them like you \nwould announce them on Twitter or like \nput it on LinkedIn or different places \nand it was all about like um it's like \nyeah can you discover those workshops so \nactually the two of you have been doing \na pretty awesome job so far with running \nliterally we're running those workshops \nweekly so for anyone that's watching us \nright now if you're new to viviate it's \nliterally an intro to within Workshop \nevery week that is Run online and one \nweek is like more like a European slash \nAsian time zones where the other one is \naround the uh time zones that are \ntraining for the Americas \num so those are great workshops to join \nand how do you find out about those \nworkers really straightforward you could \ngo under developers and then into \nworkshops and then you can see like \nthey're always like the the future \nworkshops so for example if you're \ninterested in a workshop with JP \ntomorrow that shows in my time so I can \nclick here and then you can go and \nregister yourself or for the workshop so \njust drop us your name email and then \nwe'll send you uh send you a link to the \nworkshop which will be pretty great and \nuh you know like then you'll get a smart \npeople like Zen or JP for a full hour or \nsometimes more and a good thing about \nthis is as well that is a place for you \nto ask questions on how you do certain \nstuff right \num it's definitely recommended this one \nto for anyone that's a beginner so if \nyou have somebody in your team that's \nlearning with it send them over to this \none \num we're also thinking and already like \nsomewhat in in the Midway planning all \nthe types of workshops or more advanced \ntopics \num so if you have any opinions on what \nkind of Workshop you'd love to see for \nyourself \num drop us a note either here during \nthis session or maybe uh reach out to us \non slack so yeah that's me and the \nworkshops awesome thank you if you want \nthe smart workshops you go to JP's \nworkshops if you want the fun ones you \ncome to mind okay that's that's how we \ndo it so it's almost exactly what I was \ngoing to say Zen but um I was gonna say \nfor you know actually learn stuff go to \nZen's just to listen to someone just go \non on and on that's me and then I do \nlove to chat and and to Sebastian's \npoint about coming in and asking \nquestions honestly one of the best \nthings about this Workshop in Boston and \nI have said this is just the fact that \nwe get to engage with users but like how \nthey're using wavier and we've like \nactually ended up you know talking to a \nnumber of people about and answering a \nbunch of questions like not drink just \nduring the workshop but afterwards as \nwell because that particular use cases \num and then they you know that wasn't \ncovered in in our examples whatever \nbecause it was they were unique so yeah \nit's really it's a good time I'm \nhonestly both of us so you know we're \nnot we're not horrible people we think \nso good luck to have you \nthe fun thing is that we sort of have a \ntemplate for those work shoes but we \ndon't uh and then each of you run those \nWorks in a very different way and I know \nthat you you keep trying new stuff so it \nwouldn't even hurt someone to kind of \njoin both uh or something right \num but yeah it's pretty cool yeah it's \nlike a Pearl Jam concert every set's \ndifferent \nso \nyeah it's uh I I want to keep it the \nsame template and then I get bored the \nfirst time I deliver it and then I was \nlike okay how do I how do I make it \nbetter so every time you come you'll see \na different demo or you'll see some \nsomething that's changed so \num that's why we need those Advanced \nworkshops because if you get bored you \nknow you have to you know show it with \nmore advanced features and stuff right \nyeah so we we were planning on \num seeing what other Concepts we can go \ninto so for example just an hour \nworkshop on uh document chunking and \nhave a workshop on retrieval augmented \ngeneration like all of these interesting \nConcepts that \num \nanother one could be like fine-tuning \nembedding models like there's questions \nthat we get from the community uh over \nslacking over the Forum and it would be \ninteresting to just pick one and then do \na div type \nmake it I think that would be pretty \ninteresting so those are coming as well \nall right awesome \nso this next topic is uh it's kind of \nnear and dear to my heart because I've \nbeen um learning from Abdel about this \nand further for I don't know how many \nOuija errors you've been kind of hearing \nhis thoughts through my voice but today \nI wanted to welcome Abdel onto EVA Air \nfor the first time and so now you don't \nget the second hand experience you get \nthe first hand experience from the \nprofessor himself so Abdel welcome and \nit's great to have you here \nuh thanks and and thanks for for being \nthe voice I think you've done very well \nI think \nprobably it has heard better on your \nvoice so let's see \nuh so I \nI I don't want to repeat everything you \nhave said because again you you have \nmade a terrific work think of the \naddress very much \nuh I just want to \nto talk about the last changes we did \nso we we released \num \nproduct quantization some time ago in \nversion 118 it was on their experimental \nflag because we knew it was not a \ncomplete many things were still so many \npieces had to to to come into into their \nplace \nbut uh but we wanted to test it a bit \nand to to have some feedback uh so back \nin version 118 we did some testing and \nwe saw okay performance wise it's \nworking fine but we are losing a lot of \nrecall so the the the the the answers we \nare getting \nis not well they are not as accurate as \nwe would expect \nand uh \nand then we analyze these and and we \nknew we could rescore all the data once \nwe we have it \nbut but we still had a couple of \npolicies to follow like how however Mana \ndoes it how \nAsians wpq does it like rescoring at the \nend and we wanted to to test everything \nbefore before we \na ship a complete solution and and we \ntake the experimental flag out of it so \nI have some charts maybe to to show \nwhere we were back in the 118 and where \nwe are now \nso this is this green curve so this is a \nqueries per second against recall so \nthis is how fast we we give an answer \nlike we we can we can serve 400 answers \nin the second or 100 answers in a \nqueries in a second and this is how \naccurate our our answers are like a like \none is like everything is what should be \nlike the the closest points that that we \nare trying to collect and this was our \nresults no compression no PQ and this is \nwhat we get like with the relatively \nlow compression but but high enough so \nas to to compress that so this this \norange curve is \nSix Dimensions per segment meaning we \nhad like \na 1 to 24 compression rate so if you had \nlike 24 gigabytes of vectors suddenly \nyou only need one gigabyte for storing \nthem \num \nbut you see there was a huge price in in \nPrecision of the of the results and then \nwe explore the the the different ways \nlike \nwe we could be rescoring like you know \nI'll use your example like you have the \naddress you don't have the street \nnumbers you only have the street \nuh okay it gives you an idea of the \nvectors you want to fetch it's it's even \nmore than that if you live in a given \nStreet let's say Let's uh \ncome back to this example when you apply \nthe product quantization it's not like \nyou are taking the street and leaving \nthe rest it's a vector and you have to \napply some mathematics patients so you \ncould also uh add some noise \nin the street at your story it could be \nnot the real street but the street next \nto it and then you don't want to rely a \nhundred percent \non the street you you want to give some \nroom for for for the noise \nso ideally you should say \nwell is it is \neveryone is like really silent I think \nthe thing where like I'm looking at \nother people's screens to certain \ninterrupt AB developers still talking \nI think Abdel went to into like the \ncompress from 118 and that's their low \nrecall I think I think he enabled PQ \nwell while speaking Yeah the old version \nthere we go did you just run into the \nold version of PQ of low Rico \nbe \nnope nope he's still on the old version \nyou have enough points and then you can \nyou can \ncollect the data the the so you can \ncheck all the enough points to to to \nhave a good uh result set \nbut how how do we do then we we take all \nthose vectors and we \ngo to disk take the real representation \nof the vector recompute the distances \nand take the final \nso this this made us jump from here \nto this range on Rico \nlike it's it's now really close to to \nthe to the \nuh on compress and then we also made \nsome improvements from from 118 to 121. \nnow it's a bit hard to compare so this \nis 118 no compression 121 no compression \nthe green curve is a 118 no compression \nthe blue curve is a 121 no compression \nso you see there's no PQ there and still \nthere's a huge difference and that's \nbecause of the different improvements \nthat we have introduced in in vv8 like \ngrcp grp \nyear \nuh PC support \nlike the CMD optimizations on the \ndistances calculations which by the way \nare not a \nsupported for the compress case so we \nstill have some \nmore research to do and and then if you \nsee the red curve now that's the the \ncompress on 121 is is in a good it's \nreally close to the to the blue \nso we we believe it's it's really \nout of experimental we have fixed enough \nbox and and I think it's well we believe \nit's safe to use \nuh \nwhen we made all those changes in 119 we \nthen realized okay this is going good \nbut \nthe indexing time was still like almost \ntwice when you compress \nand we debug it a bit profile it and we \nrealized okay there's a lot of distance \ncalculations between compressed vectors \nand \nI don't want to get too technical now \nbut but we have like this lookup table \nwhere we put all the distances for \ncompressed vectors to to the query \nvector and we did something similar for \nthe indexing like we have this Global \nlookup table where you compute distances \nonce and you don't do it again ever \nduring indexing you reuse it and now \nwhen you index uh \nlet me see if I shrunk to the next yeah \nwhen you index so we try with sphere \ndata set and with Wikipedia so we have \ndbpti collection of one million vectors \nvectorized with the open AI Ada \n002 \nso those are big vectors in 118 if you \nwould uh index your data \ncompress and uncompressed you have like \ntwice the time to index the data but in \n121 it's more or less the same actually \ncompress is a little bit faster but but \nnot significantly faster so it's more or \nless the same \nand the Improvement of course is so the \nbenefits are in the memory footprint \nwhere where you barely use mid 14 15 10 \nof the memory you would have needed for \nthe for the normal use cases so for \nexample with sphere 1 billion objects we \nwent from 2.7 terabytes to uh 0.7 \nterabytes like if maybe five times less \nmemory \nuh yeah \nthat's uh one of the one of the amazing \nthings about this so if can you go back \nto the first graph that you had there \nthis is a what's the compression ratio \nbetween the blue and the red light that \nyou're showing \nit's like uh the the red curve \nneeds \na 14 of the memory we need for the blue \n14 it was like \nsix and a half \ngigabytes of memory against 900 \nmegabytes something like this yeah so \nlike the fact that you're only paying \nthis much recall for that amount of \ncompression and then depending on what \nyour application is of course \nif you look at this this is so awesome \nyeah exactly 85 reduction in memory \nfootprint \num and the other thing that I was \ntalking to Abel about this is that \nwe're not only making improvements on \nthat red line that blue line the \nuncompressed version is also being \nimproved day in day out right so really \nfor the for Abdel who's working on the \nPQ stuff \nthe red line is chasing the blue line \nand the blue line is getting better and \nbetter as well so uh it's uh it's quite \na tall order so before it was closer and \nthen we made the the simdi improvements \nuh like Abdul mentioned in the blue line \nimproved even more right so \num like for for me if like this is \nanother thing I guess we're going to be \nreleasing a blog post that has all these \ndetails uh in the in the next couple of \nweeks so look out for that if you want \nto if you want to then learn all these \ndetails from Abdel \num but what's interesting is \nnow you you really have a um a valid \nchoice and going full PQ \num and you can you can kind of look and \nsee what your data is equivalent to in \nterms of the tests that we've done \nand see how much kind of recall you're \nuh paying for the up to 80 90 reduction \nin in memory footprint and yeah I I also \nwanted to say here about the price you \npay in recall that so when when we \ncompare we restore down so during the \nsearch or we can rescore at the end we \nsaw okay the the curve is slightly \nhigher I mean the the recall was exact \nexactly the same as uncompressed if we \nwould have \na risk or during the search but then the \nperformance penalty was higher and with \nthis we you have the flexibility to \nincrease your parameters your search \nparameters like your EF parameter and \nyou can still get the recall you want at \na lower price in performance this is \nanother way also to to read it you you \ndon't have to pay \nin recall if you want a better recall \nyou still so you need to use a higher EF \nparameter compare to the uncompressed \nversion okay and then you might might \nlose a few \nmicroseconds or or maybe one millisecond \nbut but that's it that you still have a \nan accurate solution I see and and by \nthe way these charts uh so I I will also \ntalk about how to Benchmark your data in \ncase you you have your own data and you \nwant to see how how it goes we are using \nscripts that are in the chaos pipeline \ncurrently in vv8 \nso I I will \nput all the information you would need \nto to replicate these experiments with \nyour own data or with whatever data you \nyou need to to run the experiments yeah \nyeah that's going to be awesome \nI think so a lot of the questions that \nwe get especially after we ran the \nsphere experiment where people trying to \nreplicate the sphere experiment and now \nlike we're gonna we're gonna release the \ncode that you can use to kind of plug \nand play your own data set and try with \nPQ without PQ and then you can \nand then if you're modifying the \nparameters of hnsw to to get some of the \nrecall back \num that's where I think it'll be super \nuseful right because then now you can \nfine tune some of the parameters of PQ \nas well as hnsw and then you can see \nwhat amount of compression works for \nyour data set that'll be awesome yeah \none thing that we didn't cover yet \num sorry JP \num it's because we always talk like we \ntalk about performance and like recall \nand everything but like I think um and \nit's great that we have a met here \nbecause to people that build with we \nmade that also means that financially \nyou can build bigger Solutions maybe \nlike maybe before we say like hey 100 \nmillion that was a wild thing now with \n85 savings on the same setup \num I could throw 700 million vectors \nright \num and then so you could kind of go like \nokay not only can I handle like way \nbigger data set my speeds are even going \nup but I'm not spending more on Hardware \nlike this is this is so incredible \num so there's definitely a great great \nopportunity uh for you to play because \nlike if you're like on a small data set \nlike you're like half a million objects \nyes it is a bit of an improvement but \nwhen you deal with like huge cases like \nthis is like a wow thing and then you \ncould either go like I could slash my \ncosts a lot because I don't need so much \nHardware or I could go like with my \ncourse I could go for bigger cases and \nthis is I think this is great \nand I'm not I'm pretty sure I met you \nalready messaging your engineers going \nlike yep get on the latest version \nyeah so for Ahmed I think there's two \ninteresting things there's the \nmulti-tenancy update and then the PQ \nupdate and \nso yeah lots of lots of interesting \nthings which is a great segue to JP \nwho's going to be talking about some of \nthese interesting updates JP what do you \nwhat are you bringing us today fabulous \nI want uh I'll be pretty quick but yeah \nthat video really reminded uh so the the \ntalk really reminded me of you know keep \nyour vb8 versions up to date right \nbecause a lot of people ask us about \nlike oh I'm having problem XYZ and quite \noften the solution is oh have you tried \nthe latest version because we've made \nimprovements and what have you and this \nis like an exam and those curves with \nthe uncompressed data is a big example \nof that because even if you weren't \nusing PQ just by updating the latest \nversion you get huge performance gains \nlike the two uncompressed curves are \nlike just wildly different places to \neach other \num so that's that's really cool um but \nthen if you can share the screen that \nI've got open \nI can talk to 121 oh that's interesting \ndid that sit around your screen as well \nlike what's happening is yeah I jittered \na little bit I don't know why it \nvibrated uh just just very excited Zen \njust very excited \num so 121 came out last week it is now \navailable on WCS as well and you'd have \nseen some social messages so if you \nreally you know if you like this cute \nleviate guy \num check that out as well but there are \na few \num features here that are really really \ninteresting so I'll go through them one \nby one fairly quickly so we've got new \ncontains any contains all operators this \nis syntactic sugar but what it really \ndoes is I actually scroll down to the \nright section before I talk about it \num but what it does is instead of having \nto have a bunch of logic combinations of \nlogical operators like whether it's ands \nor ORS this allows you to stream like \nthat and it might when I describe it not \nlike sound like a big deal because you \nknow all this is doing the same thing \nbut if you're writing code or if you're \nreading it later it will just like you \nknow it would be easier to ride more \nlikely debug free and easier to \nunderstand the logic internally what's \ngoing on so \num and it doesn't really change anything \nelse other than the fact that I'll use \nthe graphql example here you're just \nusing a different operator right here \nand in terms of contains any this will \nreplace a series of um or statements \nwhich we've all written long boring \ninvolved um logical combinations States \nbefore you know whether from Excel or in \nactual programming languages and whatnot \nso this will make that a lot easier so \nthat's contains any and contains all \nright and it's now I believe supported \nin all of our client libraries as well \nso please check that out cool so that's \nthat one and the other one and you \ntouched on it earlier then in terms of \nreally irrelevance time and I'm sure \nyou'll you know I see you sitting up on \nit about the multi-tenancy improvements \nand this is a cool one so when we launch \nmulti-tenancy we talked about scaling \naspects of it right how many you know as \na rule of thumb how many tenants can we \nsupport per node and whatnot now what \nwe've done with this update or uh not me \nI didn't do any of it but the team has \ndone with this update has been to \nintroduce the ability to activate or \ndeactivate tenant shards each tenant is \na Shard and what this allows you to do \nis to say if you have a million users \nand half of them are inactive users you \ncan just switch them not necessarily off \nin terms of deleting them but you can \nturn them into the deactivated users and \nthey'll take up no memory footprint \nbasically right so you'll store all the \ndata you can activate them if they do \ncome back online but again it's a really \nconvenient way to scale without kind of \nwasting Hardware resources on data and \nmemory footprint that you don't need \num so I believe it's somewhat \nexperimental so in the sense that the \nAPI might change a little bit I believe \nthere are more States coming and so on \nbut this is really really cool so again \nif you're you know building something \nwith a bunch of tenants and you know \nthis is like going to be a really good \ncost saving and useful feature for you I \nthink I'm going to scroll through all \nthe pros and there's been a \nperformance Improvement in terms of like \nhow the system manages \nkind of coordinating all these different \noperations going on for multi-tenancy \nbecause there's you know \nlarge scale less attendance lots of \nthings needs to be done so basically \nthat's an under the hood improvement \nthough so again if you upgrade from 120 \nto 121 you get this for free right and \nwho doesn't like free stuff \nOkay so we've got new modules and then \nI'll throw this back to you uh when I'm \ndone rambling and the first one is a \ntext to back GPT for all module we've \ngot the texture back contextreme module \nas a local vectorizer and that works \nwell but it's kind of an older model so \nperhaps it's not as performant as some \nof the more modern models and there was \none solution of to to that is to use the \ntext-to-back Transformers module with \nwhich you can use any of the modern \nTransformer architectures now \num obviously then menu views use that or \nknow about it know that you need a GPU \nyou kind of do really data GPU if you \nwant to do any kind of massive scale \nvectorization on it but this module is \noptimized for CPU use so it's got one of \nthe mini LM modules available for it and \nwith this you can get really really fast \nvectorization and or inference whichever \nway you want to call it performance out \nof just the CPU so encourage you to \ncheck that out together \nand the next one of course we're really \nexcited about is the multi-teve fine \nmodule I can see Zen just vibrating or \ntutoring with excitement there and that \nallows us to use the bind model to \nprocess multi-model data \nand um and then we'll you know show a \ncool demo after this \num then gets just all the fun stuff but \nhere's a little preview so if you look \nat the blog post \num there's a little demo here of like \nusing uh is it sound to retrieve images \nand a video to retrieve another image is \nthat right yeah so this one I played the \nyou can play the uh file at the top \nthere \num yeah there's a little there so that's \nthe sound of a car honking and then this \nis the image that comes back \num and I'll show in the demo what what \nother things you can do \num the \nI I guess I'll go into it when I when I \ngo into the demo otherwise I'm going to \nstart rambling and I won't stop exactly \nit's my time now it's that go away \num it probably came up with this car \nbecause sports cars you know they just \nrun you over so uh yeah listen to \nSebastian you need to pay us more for us \nto put Pitch the Bugattis in here \nman \nI'm getting a playlist just just for a \npicture yeah well I tried \num so there's that and then there's a \ncouple other things I'll just go through \nquickly so there's been a suite of \nperformance improvements under the hood \num so you can see the little waviate \nmascot being extremely happy \num one of them that is not entirely \nunder the hood is the virtual memory \naccess so mmap is the existing method or \nthe existing function that's being used \nto map virtual memory and use \num it \ncan have some potential challenges if \nyou start to have like basically \nsignificant load so we've introduced \nthis option under the hood to use period \num so default doesn't change so if you \ndon't do anything nothing changes but if \nthis is a potential challenge for you \nyou can try out the solution \num so we mentioned simply operations \nbefore and for those of you like me who \nmight not necessarily know what CMD is \nit's a basically parallels \nparallelization technique in processing \num so if you've you know if you're as \nold as me and and seeing things like MMX \non stickers it's kind of like the same \nthing on the old Intel chips now this is \nalready available on um Intel processors \nbut we've added this for um 64 \nprocessors so that's really cool and \nagain upgrade you get free performance \nimprovements \nI feel like a salesperson \num and I've dealt with no this is \nuh yeah you know I'll wait there \num and we're gonna get we get best team \ndeath improvements in terms of how the \nvector indexes \num basically built and and how it's used \nso we've got these two key improvements \nin terms of How It's encoded and in \nterms of How It's accessed and what's \navailable when to different processes so \nthese are under the hood improvements \num and it'll just basically make wavy8 \ngo even faster which is really really \nneat \num one change that you probably want to \nbe mindful of is the backups there's a \ncouple of things here \none highlight that you should know is \nthat 121 backups cannot be used in 120 \nso if my sales pitch is successful and \nyou do upgrade before you upgrade it \nmight be a good idea to produce a 120 \nbackup in case you do think you might \nwant to roll back you know you know \nproduction system or what have you \nbecause there are a whole bunch of \nimprovements like compression that'll \nmake the backups they think cheaper \ncertainly for cloud providers and \npotentially faster I have to check but \nit's not backwards compatible so backup \nyour data and upgrade if you think you \nmight be rolling back the most important \nthing about backups is them \nyeah yeah make sure you back up to a \nmedium that you can use \num uh so yeah and and one small thing \nwhich is also but important is a hybrid \nsearch algorithm refinement so with the \nnew hybrid ranking algorithm that we \nintroduced in 120 I believe and that was \nto do it the way it was scored \num there was a use case where if you \nretrieved on your small set of data the \nresults might fluctuate probably more \nthan you might like so we've introduced \nthis little thing where even if you ask \nthe like three objects we've yet will \ngrab a hundred right and then calculate \nthe scores and just give you back the \nthe three just because that stabilizes \nthe way the scores are calculated \num so you won't see it um you'll \nprobably just notice that if you're \nusing the \num relative score Fusion I think is the \nalgorithm name if you're using that if \nthe score is a little bit more stable \nthan before \num and so it'll be perhaps a little bit \nmore intuitive when you look at the \nscores \nso yeah that's kind of it for me \num it's a bit of a lightning round but \nagain it's available in WCS it's \navailable open source um it's really \ncool it's fast it's got all these new \nbells and whistles on it so again \num yeah please try it out and let us \nknow \nawesome thank you I'm sold I'm actually \nusing it on this computer right now yeah \nI can prove it what are you doing with \nit Zen yeah let me show you let's see oh \nwow that's really cool \nso what I wanted to talk about was um \none specific module so I've been playing \naround with this um for a while \nlet me show you guys here so this demo \nis not going to be as cool as the demo \nthat we saw earlier uh from Ahmed but \nyou can you can take the multi-direct \nbind module and you can kind of \nincrementally uh use it to to get \nsomething \num that that could be as cool you're \ngonna have to put a lot of work in but \num let me show you a little bit of the \ncapability of the multi-davecbide \nbefore I go into the demo so the model \nitself has the ability to encode seven \ndifferent modalities and that means that \nyou can perform any to any modality \nsearch right so you can pass in text and \nsearch for text audio video images and \nthen there's a bunch of other modalities \nbut these are the exciting ones and then \nyou can do that with anything so your \nquery can be any of these modalities as \nwell and the output can be at any of the \nuh modalities so that's what I mean by \nany to any search \nso the two modalities and if I if I was \ngoing to show you all the combinations \nwe'd be here all day so let me just show \nyou some of the most exciting \ncombinations \num so what I did here is I put together \na notebook \nuh to show you how easy it is right so \nuh setup is pretty straightforward I've \ngot this running locally on my computer \num I've created a schema this one has \ntwo classes one where I'm storing images \nand another one where I'm storing audio \nuh depending on your use case you can \nhave one class that stores uh all the \nmodalities or multiple classes that \nstore different ones \num but for my use case I'm going to show \nyou two different types of searches so \none over image and one over audio so I'm \nadding the I'm adding the data \nseparately \nand then I've got a bunch of helper \nfunctions here to kind of make the \nprocess a little easier \nso then you go in you add all the images \nso I've got I think 20 25 images so it's \na toy example maybe next time I'm \npreparing a talk so for that one I'll \nhave a real like a scalable example \num and then I add the audio file so I've \ngot a bunch of audio files that I scrape \nfrom the internet \nand then now we can perform first I'll \nshow you uh text image audio video to \nimage search \nso here \nyou can go in and let's say we search \nfor the concept A sparse Market this \ncomes back so this is nothing new you \ncould do this with clip \num and then this works just as well \nactually the image bind module is built \non top of the clip module so the the \nimage and the text modalities that it \nuses are clip \nso um this works as well as the clip \nmodule itself right so there's all of \nthese \nand then we can go to image to image \nsearch which you can also do with the \nclip module \nso here the formatting is a bit wonky \nbut this is the query image and then I \ncan show you here this is the query \nimage and then you get I took three \nresponse images and I and I squished \nthem together so you can see relevant \nthings here if this is your query image \nyou get the response image over here \nif this is a query image then you get \nresponse images \num no this is this is all old stuff \nright so let me show you new stuff \nso now you can play an audio sound let's \nsay you wanted to query with this audio \nand I don't know if this will play for \nyou but let me try it \nno did you guys hear that nope okay so \ndelete I'll release it yeah so it's it's \nI'm not I'm not gonna so this is \nThe Voice \nso this is a car uh honking and you have \nto trust me and then I'll and I'll open \nand then so this will this is what you \nget back when you do that which is \ninteresting because you get the car but \nthen you also get the city which is \nwhere now this demo is not as heavy \nhitting as if you if you could have \nheard it but this is a lion roaring \nand you get all this stuff back \nand then you can keep playing around \nwith this so I've had a lot of fun with \nthis \num I'll release this uh notebook \nafterwards so you can play around with \nthis as well you can kind of swap in and \nout uh the um the files that you're \nputting in \nand then you can also do near video \nsearch so here \nthis one you'll be able to see so I've \ngot this uh video that's playing uh no \naudio on this one and then when you your \nquery is a video it goes in and this is \nwhat you get back as response images \num now keep in mind in this class I only \nhave images so it can only give me back \nimages if I had multiple modalities \nstored in this class then I would be \nable to get back other things as well \num \nyeah so if it's your query video you can \ngo through this we get this response \nif your query video is a bunch of lions \nyou get \nspec \nand then it's pretty amazing \nyeah so it's kind of the first time I \nsaw it I was wowed and then I played a \nplayed around with it for like two weeks \nthe other thing that you can do so this \nis just images right you're getting back \nimages \num the other thing you can do which is \nreally cool is \nuh one second let me scroll here \nyour video search \nso then the other class I put in a bunch \nof audio files so \nlet me scroll down to this \nokay \num so here \nthe \nthe query is this uh text so animals on \na farm and it retrieves the audio sound \nthat's most related to the animals on a \nfarm okay and this is \num you won't be able to hear this but \nthis is a um a a rooster in the morning \nokay \num so you can play around with that as \nwell \nand then if you can query with an image \nthis is yeah I'm not going to make the \nsound oh come on maybe next time you're \non the friends here \nso if this is your query image you get \nthe audio of uh so in this case actually \nit didn't return the audio of a \nbadminton that's because I had audio of \nbadminton in the database as well but \napparently in this image the man is more \nrelevant than the fact that he's playing \na badminton so it it sent me uh the uh \naudio of a of a man sneezing I had both \nthings in my database and apparently \nthat was closer in Vector space so I got \na true here \nI I made that sound that counts \num and then you can do query to query \nright so something like a Shazam app \nwhere if I play a tune it will be able \nto retrieve a song for me this one I \nplayed a tune of a dog barking and then \nit it barks back at me \nso it plays uh another uh another \num audio sound here \nand then the last one so we could \nfinally uh get an answer to what did the \nfox say \nyeah but it'll be in Fox speak so \nso I these these two dogs are kind of \nconversing with each other in \nmulti-dimensional space I don't know \nwhat they're talking about but it's \npretty interesting and then the last one \nhere if you play \num if I play a video so if this is my \nquery the entire video I can get back \num the a an audio sound here which is \njust a school belt ringing right which \nwas the closest thing to to a classroom \nso yeah \nJPM yeah \num and each input here is being embedded \ninto like it's been converted into one \nembedding right \nyes so there's \num there's multiple models there's six \ndifferent models the one for image and \nvideo is the same so that's why you have \nseven modality six models \num so the interesting part here is that \nyou have six different embedding spaces \nbut each one of them is kind of binded \ntogether that's why it's called image \nbind by the representation of clip so \nclip understands words and images really \nwell and it and the paper details this \nthey use Clips understanding of images \nand words to pull in the representations \nof audio video all of these other \nmodalities to be close to clip and so \nthat's why even if you even though you \nhave all these multiple modalities if I \nsend in a video it goes through a \nseparate model if I send an audio it \ngoes through a separate model \nbut the embedding space of all these \nmodalities \num it kind of talks to each other in the \ntraining uh in the training Loop so \nthat's why you can kind of use these six \nsix models together at query time yeah \nand I guess from a user perspective like \nhow you decide to chunk if you have a \nmovie or if you have like you know like \nI never thought about you have an \nearnings call right how you chunk that \nwould be really important because you \nbasically couldn't you know or average \nVector for that segment so if you have \ntwo very just separate scenes after a \nscene transition that might not be what \nyou want you want to have some way of \nintelligently chunking that information \nsomewhere which would be kind of you \nknow very important depending on whether \nit's audio or video or combination of \nboth \num it'll be like a fairly significant \ndecision as to how you decide to do that \nyeah so if you wanted to so this is \nwhere chunking gets really interesting \nso if I play this \num video here \nthis uh this video is entirely about the \nclassroom right but if for some reason \npart way through this video you had a \ncar or something like this \num then it wouldn't work right because \nthen you're averaging you're generating \none vector which is the average over 21 \nseconds which is a lot and you can read \nthis in the papers as well but per \nsecond you generate two frames so you \nget two image vectors per uh per uh \nSecond and then you do that over 21 \nseconds and you take the average over \nall of them so you kind of Squish \ntogether all these representations if \nyou have very uh diverse frames in a \nvideo it's going to be very difficult \num and this is where uh ahmed's um \npresentation comes in right so you have \nto do a lot more to to deal with that \nyou have to do very interesting kind of \nchecking strategies and and other \nalgorithms to deal with that but out of \nthe box the the model itself just kind \nof squishes the entire thing together \nif you have a big video you probably do \nwant it \num you want to kind of semantically \nChunk so that you have one concept per \nvector \nthat's awesome \num I mean the cool thing is that sorry \num because I run I've been playing the \nthe demo as well with the model and at \none point I use as an input a picture \nthat we took from like uh basically ujp \nMarion and like uh Derek and Tommy like \nwere together and we took a picture \ntogether and we also I think Doug was \nholding his dog and the interesting \nthing was that like when I presented \nthis uh picture for search the output \nthat I got back were pictures of people \nlike people Gatherings and there's also \npictures of dogs \num so the model was able to kind of like \nrecognize like oh yeah this content is \nimportant \nyeah we didn't have any meerkats in the \ndata set but like uh \nVasco is here with me and he's sad you \nknow he's depressed now he's like what \ndo you mean no meerkats \nyeah we're gonna change that demo for \nnext time \nthe other interesting thing about this \nis that um this has only been trained on \nkind of publicly available data so you \ncan I think this was trained on nine \ndifferent data sets that were stitched \ntogether \num but if you want to use it for like \nvery specific applications \num then it won't know about those of \ncourse and this is goes into what Emmett \nwas talking about for that purpose you \nhave to fine-tune the model to to learn \nabout A New Concept and then it'll be \nable to associate that New Concept with \num other Concepts that it already has in \nits embedding space and that's where I \nthink the potential for this can go \nthrough the roof right it's really \nusable out of the box it knows about a \nlot of general concepts but if you have \na proprietary thing that that only your \nEnterprise data has \nthen you can actually fine-tune the \nmodel and then use it before you feed \ndata into your vector database and then \nnow you have kind of customized \nmultimodal multimodal search which I \nthink the potential for that is uh is \nreally great \nall right that's everything for me folks \nand then do you think that to yourself \nas a host no sorry yeah I'm gonna I'm \ngonna throw it back to my I'm gonna \nthrow it back to Sebastian to round us \noff \nwait me again okay \num so thank you all for listening for \nwatching us if you enjoyed this video \ngive us a like \num definitely come back for the next \nepisode in a month we'll do it again \num if you have an exciting demo to show \noff definitely would like to see you \num a big big thank you to Ahmed for uh \nfor his super nice demo our super \nexciting uh to see what you built and um \nyeah definitely looking forward to see \nmore of your work and what we want can \ndo I definitely recommend to anyone \nwatching here check uh check B1 because \nthat's an amazing company \num super exciting about that finally \ngetting the real real update not to Zen \nproxy \num so it's nice always nice to have you \nhere my spider brother \num you know and uh big big welcome for \ndinner and money in the new starters so \num yeah and JP and then keep keep \nkicking and screaming you know maybe one \nday uh you wear me off and I'll get you \nthat pay rate so thank you for watching \nand see you next month and yeah once \nmore thank you for Ahmed for your \nspecial guest as a special guest bye \nthank you folks bye \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Air Episode 11", "path": "", "link":
