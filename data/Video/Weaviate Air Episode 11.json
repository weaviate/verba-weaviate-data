{"text": "Welcome to Weaviate Air - Weaviate's live discussion and knowledge panel! Thanks for tuning in to this episode featuring a ... \noh I think we're live yeahwelcome welcome to this viviate air uhit's episode number 11. uh double onethis is super excitingum we kind of had a little confusionbecause I thought the Zen will kick itout but I can do it you know like youall used to this face you know andmaking a lot of noiseum so today is going to be reallyawesome we have loads of great people onthe call uh we have a special guestAhmed from B1 who's going to do a reallycool demo of something that he builtwith with it but alsoum his the whole business that he'sbuilding is super exciting so I don'twant to spoil it all just yet but it'sgoing to be super excitingum of course we have two new starterspeople that just joined with it recentlyso we have Mario and Duda they will sayhi to you very soon and tell you what'swhat and of course uh Abdel comes to usto talk to us about some new indexing uhideas and optimizations in viviate thisis really exciting writing stuff youwill get quite a bit technical but itwill be inclusive for everyone and ofcourse the usual suspect Zen and JP welland meum so this is this should be good so uhZen how do we run it what's up yeah so Iwant to start off with uh our our mainguest today Ahmed so welcome to the showum thanks for having me yeah it's gonnabe awesome I'm looking forward at yourdemo maybe we can start off by uhintroducing you uh to the audience uhhere at weviateyeah sure I'm I'm the founder and CEO ofB1 so it's a French startup that helpsorganizations navigate through largeamounts of unstructured dataand I remember last time with uhSebastian we had a great uh demo duringthe the Intel Dev Summituh and today is gonna be uhare like differentbut uh you know maybe I will talk aboutthat laterokay yeahawesome thank youI think so one of the great things thatI liked about yourum your platform was that you showed thedemo in the uh in the Intel Summit butoutside of that you've got a lot ofother functionality as well right youyou showed me the entire pipelineum that you usecan you talk a little bit more aboutthat before we get into the demo new andimproved yeah sureumum I think when you uh approach AI uh uhin the Enterprise world uhyou can just like talk about text onlyuh you need to take into accounts likeimages uh videos uh audio and othermodalities and most of the hype rightnow is around text and I do believe thatwe need to include other modalities aswell to have like a truly functional anduseful product and this is whywe have a full workflow to just automatethe the building of a an own AI forEnterprises which means that anEnterprise can come with its data andthen get out with like a fullyfunctional AI that isum specialized uh in its domain and forobvious reasons uh for competitivenessfor Innovation and the this AI that webuilt for our Enterprises keep learningfrom new data and that was like the thethe the main issue that we are solvingtrying to solveyeah it's really interesting becausethere's this whole debate going on rightnow in the AI Community where people aresaying that language is enough to get usto AGI and they believe like GPT56789 eventually will get to GPT AGIum but then there's this other school ofthought which you probably agree withthat you can't get to AGI withoutmultimodal reasoning right it's not umenough to just be a master of languageyou have to understand other modalitieslike humans doum to be able to to be able to reachthis kind of barrier of AGIyeah absolutely I mean uhhere we are talking but uh your faceexpressions are importantuh you know whatever happens outside oflike language is really important so Imean uh visual is a I think is much moreimportant than text only so we tend tocombine that with language understandingto have a kind of likeum a very good understanding of ourwords because I I really believe thatmany others believe that text only is isis not enough we are making progresstoward the AGI but still I mean I'veseen some some research around likemilitary modalities where you have likedepth for example this is something thatweum we are like working on but it's it'sreally tough uh to uh to to just so uhmake machines learn about that uhand there are a lot of other like uhmodalities that could be really usefulto achieve that that AGI but text onlyis of course just a the beginning andyou know we are all grateful to GPT toyeahum to to to have made that you knowpossible and accessible to everyone sothis is just the beginningbecause I think even even thosecompanies so if you look at Google Palmuh openai they're adding multi-modalityto the regenerative uh setups as wellum the other interesting thingum is that there's this Paradox andmorvix Paradox which says that a lot ofthe things that we think are verydifficult are actually easy to computeso um like identifying or picking outimages uh like segmenting a radiologyimage we think it's very difficultcomputers can do itum like labeling thousands of images ina second we think it's very difficultbut computers can do it but a lot of thethings that we take for granted likewhen a when a child picks up a ball andthen throws it we can't really automatethat so um that's where multi-modality Ithink comes in right because in order toa simple Act of throwing a ball you haveto be able to controla lot of other modalities to to actionthatyeah if we uh I mean if we makeadvancements towardsum uh understanding complex things likeyou knowum uh touch and you know feelings andother other modalities that we areliving with like on a daily basis thatthat that could be a great achievementbutfrom our perspective if we manage todeal with text images videos andprobably audio that that that could belike really yeahgood advancements and of course I meannot somedayum when we see the the rapid uh racetowards like AGI I think in less thanfive five years we'll see like systemsthat could understand the world asas we humans do and you know probably uhhelp us be more like efficient andamplify our intelligence this is this isat least our goal that we want this toto enable humans with theuh like uh more intelligence and more uhanalytics and you know be able to actlike an assistant greater than replacingyou know domain expertise which Ibelieve it's not yet there yeahso you were last time at you you showedme a great demo and I it got me allhyped and then I shared that demoum in some of my other talks and thenyou mentioned that you have a new andimproved demo so you you haven't told meanything else and I tried to get somedetails but it's been on the hush hushso let's let's go into that demoum if you're ready so let me share yourscreen on theon the main screen here okay cool yeahso as the light just see it's a simpleinterface uh like a kind of GPTinterface and uh today I'll be switchingto two different domains which arefinancial services and real estateuh Financial Services because I I usedto work uh in that domain like for 15 16years soum I've seen a lot of Enterprisesstruggle withum you know financial analysis and allthe legal documents all the disclaimersyou know all that kind of reports andeasier reports so I I thought thathaving a system that could likespecialize in financial services thatthat could be cool and also I wanted toshow like a demo about real estatebecause this is a kind of like domainthat hasn't been disrupted yetum by AIand so yeah let me startso this is a guy that I like very verymuch Warren Buffett and he's really likeumgives like with wisdom advices soumprobably sometimes when you have like atwo or three hours video you don't wantlike to to watch the whole whole videoyou just want to get answers forspecific like questions so this is uhsomething we are working onand let me show you what what we get interms of results so I just copy thevideo URLI just push it hereand I process that videoand once it's processed I can startasking questions so I I'm gonna askquestions to uh warrant with it soshould we go to a college to besuccessful because he was talking aboutsuccess so I guessuh this could be relatedand so the system will understand whathas been said during like the theinterview so the answer is according toWarren Buffett going to college is notnecessary for everyone this is probablynot an advice to followuh for most of the bill so he believesthat the best investment one can make ison oneself and you know a lot of a lotof wisdom and probably I can ask it youknow what are theuh biggest mistakes uh in investingand so it goes on like the biggestmistakes people make when investingaccording to Warren Buffett are tryingto trade too frequently and notrealizing etc etc so this was like uhthe kind of videos that you you want toto get answers for but probably notwilling to spend like one hour or twohours listening to the full uh the fullvideoanotheruse case for financial analysts is to beable to follow like earning calls or uhlike profit warnings and all thecandidate kind of like uhevents that happens in the financialmarkets so similarly I mean I'm gonna uhadd a new video and process itand probably start asking some somequestionsuh like how isinterest rates uh impacting stocksand it's it's gonna just like understandwhat has been said in the in the videoand give me uh answers this is by theway running on Intel uh for GenerationCPUs which are really powerful andsuitable for that kind of of use casessoum yeah one thing to mention is thatoutside of the context of the video thethe the solution doesn't answer so ifyou ask it for example what do you wantto have for dinner or for lunch orshould I go out tonight it's it's notgonna answer it needs to be in thecontext of of uh of the videoI'm not going to read like all the ofthe examples but I I see in video forexample here and I'd like to know moreuh so what does the video uh says aboutIndiaso again I mean you don't need to watchthe whole video so the video suggestthat in video expected to have a goodquarter this is the answer that I waslooking forumso uh another use case is like a fullinterview of CEOs and very often uh youhave some tips for financial analyststhat comes out of these interviews andum a lot of people are watching thoseinterviews especially for like CNBC orother other big Brands andumso I'm gonna take this oneand start another processingso how did I envidia uh Grew Fromuh gaming to AI so again I don't want towatch the full video I just want toanswer because I mean how come like invideo is known for gaming and now it'slikeuh the the leader in inproviding like hardware for for for AIand this is like the full storyso 2006 and you know Nvidia released thesoftware toolkit uh called Huda and youjust uh have like the answers to uh toyour question so now comes in the mostinteresting piece which is themultimodalities soumum I was wondering if Nvidia is uhuh billionaire chips in in the US orsomewhere else so uh what's therelationship betweenJensen and gsmc I'm sorry for the Jand so it's gonna answer like myquestion so Jensen the founder of uh NCOof Nvidia relies on Taiwan jcmc tomanufacture nearly all Nvidia chips butum yeah I want to hear it so I justshowed the videosand I don't know if you hear the soundof the video but here the video startswhere uh Jensen's is still the founderof tcmc that it was his his herouhso again mixing modalities makes it likemore fun and more efficient tounderstandum I said I was talking about like I wasgoing to talk about financial servicesbut alsoum real estate and I here we are goingto visit like uh mega mansion in Dubaiuh it's actually a 60 million so I'mexpecting a lot from this mentionand uh here we go uh so I'm gonnaprocess this video so this video is like39 minutesum full of images and you know someinteresting stuffis that a tour of your house Amit I wishsoum the video is processed and let's likeuh let's say I'm a real estate agent andI I'd like to look for a beautiful housefor my clients and I don't want to seeall of them and I just want to see uhyou know the good answers for uh forsome of like the the things that mattersto my clientsand so I'm gonna ask first to summarizethe video so the video is a tour ofluxurious mega mansion in Dubai and youknow it describes like the dimension butI can go further and say uh lists alluh amenitiesand so here we get like a summary of allamenities but I like to cook and thekitchen is really important to me so umI'd like toof my clientsso I'd like to see uh the kitchenand so it's going to describe a littlebit like the kitchen but also uhso yes I can show you the kitchen thekitchen is in this property super modernhas stunning marble control yeah that'sthat's really nice so I'd like to see itso uh hereso this is a very very nice it's okayequipped yeah uh kitchen so this isvalidated but in Dubai you know thatpeople don't work a lot they use theircar and they have like very luxuriouscars so I'm wondering if there is any uhluxurious car or probably a Bugatti inthe garagefor 60 million I expect to have like aBugattiso let's see what the systemuh answers for that oh yeah this is aBugatti diesel but you know I know theBugatti Chiron that's DeVos somethingthat I don't really know so let's see ithereI can see where we meet later oncarbon fiber and all that kind of stuffin our full description and I don't losetime I just get right where my answer iscan you ask it like how many sports carsports cars you saw I think there are afew Ferraris there uhuh Sportsno problemyeah we can see it's like in thetimelinebut I've already seen like this thisvideo I think there are a bunch of likeFerraris and the Bugatti and you knowuh so yeahPorsche 918 uh post GT2 a Ferrari Monzauh Ferrari forfive eight yeah so a lot of luxuriouscars actually as you can just you knowso this this was like the mustacherouscaramount ofexcellent this is an amazing demo I loveit I like I like how there was thistransition from like you are talking tothis likeum yeah to to the AI kind of like hey goanalyze this video and I'll ask you abunch of questions and then you go likeoh this is interesting I want toactually listen to that part for myselfum that's like that's so super coolbecause then yeah you could it could bea long video right like you're onlyinteresting that one bit but you don'tremember what you want yeah I mean in in20 years ago I I don't think I had thecamera in my in my phone now I havethree cameras in single phone so you canimagine that a lot of people areshooting camera like videos and thosevideos end up probably uh in theinternet andfrom what I have readum like 83 percent of all uh internettraffic is is coming from videos so uhwe thought it could be like cool to havea tool to to be able like to to to fetchthose videos and you know understandwhat's what's being said and uh and getextract some value from those videoswithout spending too much time on ittotally I mean actually the the greatuse case is we be there we could um atthe end actually drop a link to we bethere and start asking questions rightyeah and I I can I can add something Imean with the performance like combineduh like the the combining like the thepower of the interval uh CPUs and gpusand also the performance of the uh ourfavoritedatabase which is very weird uh I Ithink we can achieve real-time analysison videosnice hey so we've got a question from uhfrom the audience actually from our CTOum so lovediff join late forgive me ifyou explained this initially are thevideos frames uh transcribed stored asembeddings how does it find the righttime in the videoyes that's right I mean we we storeevery modality as embeddings uh in wheelGates and we have uh like sometechniques and algorithms that's combinethose like modalities to be able to uhfind the right moment uh find the rightinformation to show and you know it'sall about uh relevance we don't want tohave multiple results but have like themass meaningful result and yeaheverything is stored as embeddings andwe view it is is kind of like Central towhat we do because uh we needperformance we don't want to wait toomuch for queries and uh when you dealwith videos you deal with a lot of uhinformation so uh one there is only Ithink one way to do it is is using avector database and with it is is ourknowledge that the best onethank youyeah one one follow-up question to thisso one so a great demo but one part ofyour demoum kind of piqued my interest so andthis is something differentum when you search for uh how is Jensenrelated to tsmc and like I have anunderstanding of how it can generate ananswer but the timestamp also went tothe part of the video where Jensen wastalking about tsmcum the video doesn't show that he'stalking about tsmc it's in the audio sodo you guys have audio in there as wellnow yeah as I said I mean we we workwith a lot of modalities we just storethem all and we have like our systemjust finding out what's what's what'sthe best uh thing to show uh there arelet me give you an example like you aredriving and uh you hear music like uh Idon't know your favorite musicuh if we translate that in a video youwould see yourself like driving and onthe background having like some musicthis is not really relatedand so if we question that video uh thenwe need to ensure that what we get as ananswer wouldn't include like thebackground music even if it's nice sothere are a lot of like playing withmodalities just uh is it's not just likeabout audio but uh but it's it's morethan that it's understanding what'swhat's meaningful for the users at theend and not trying to replicate 100 howthe brain worksum but just trying to find like usefuluse cases that could could amplify likethe human intelligence and and let uslike uh interact with those videos in asimilar swinethat's so interesting so you've gotyou've actually got multiple modalitiesof search that are going in in thebackground I guess the the next questionand perhaps this this will be the lastquestion for me isum you're doing image search in thebackground text search audio searchcan you tell us how you decide which oneis of the most important to answer anyone question so when when you searchabout tsmc the audio search is importantbut when you search about Bugatti the umobviously the image search that'sshowing the Bugatti is important so howdo yousay that audio is important now but nowimage is important or something else isimportant yeah yeah I mean you ask theuh or probably Sebastian I don't know Idon't remember you asked you know uh howhow we deal with with such such you knowuh modalities uh we have like a dataplatform that we use to provide humanfeedback and this human feedback is usedto be able to retrain the model and havelike an active learning Loop to be ableto to try to figure out which like uhmodality is best suited for for theanswers so it's it's probably workingthe same way as uh error.chefand you knowthe more people will use the system themore the system gets better in definingwhat's important and what's not uh whilegetting their their answersso the answer is not straightforward butyou know it's kind of likeuh reinforcement learning you know andprobably from a country to anotherthings might like change and so we'rejust trying to figure out how best wecan do that especially that we need towe have like some AI safety concerns uhbecause the prompt is is free so uh youcan you can ask whatever question uh youyou'd like but we need to ensure thatthe answers are not biased and theydon't contain like harmful content andall that kind of stuff so there's a lotof work to do in that in that regard toensure that these systems are safe foruh like a larger audience for now we arefocusing on the Enterprise use butprobably laterwe want this system to be like usefulfor for everyone and for that we need towe have some additional steps to gothroughsuper interesting thank you for the demoI'm confusing of modalities is superamazing yeah go ahead JP sorry I'm justsorry I'm sorry to button um if I wereto learn more about you know B1 thenuh and whatnot like what's the bestplace to go obviously this is locallyhosted um demo so they go to the websiteuh you know give your phone call that Idon't know what do they do yeah for nowwe are targeting likeum Enterprises uhbecause we we believe that this kind ofsystems multi-modal systems are are moreuseful to to Enterprises for now and soyeah you can go to the website or I canleave my mydetails uh you know and we of course weare happy to to collaborate on anyprojects that is related to to this kindof like research and of course I didn'tshow one interesting part is when youmix actually videos with documentsuh and this is really interestingbecause you get especially FinancialServices you get a lot of documents soyou want to send ESG reports and have aninterview at the same time and see ifthere is any difference if like the thevalues of the companyis really translated into this thesereports so there are a lot of use casesbut I see those use cases for now in theEnterprise world and probably we'll findout if if there are other use cases itcould be applied tolike larger audienceawesome thank you for that that was thatwas greatall right so it's it's going to be toughto top that honestly and it's going tobe very difficult is that what you'resaying yeah yeah the best for thebeginning and then there's nothingbetter than thatno just okay bye[Laughter]all right so uh next up um probablynoticed um Sebastian introduced Marionand Duda so new new members to the teamand yeah so let's hear a little bitabout you let's introduce you to thewevia community and yeahyeah thank you thank you then hi welcomeeveryoneum um I'm Marion I newly joined the gateas a community manager and I must say uhAhmed I'm I was really Amazed by thatum by that um demo and I probably can'ttop it but I just saw throughout thewhole demo oh my gosh how would thatmake my life more easier because we justconducted user Community interviewsand I actuallyum you know recorded some of thefeedbackum our community members had and itwould be so awesome right to and and Ialso took a lot of notes on paper and itwould be so awesome to kind of combinethese documents together with um whathas been said and just ask the questionyou know did they findum did they find our documentationhelpful right and then get it from thecontext that would be amazing so yeahand that is but that is a great bridgeto what I wanted to sayum I joined recently as I said and umfor us Community matters that's why I'mhere and I want to spread you know joyand happiness and really kindness intoour communityand I also want our community members tobe valued and to get the value out ofviviate right so that's why we arestarting with initiative where we go outto our community members and ask themabout you know our documentation newfeatures different uh use cases in Vividand just ask them how they are you knowhow they are finding their Wows andtheir challenges and learn from theirfeedback and just get better and make itmake make it more more awesome maybe alittle bit more about myself I liveclose to Berlin soum I'm going to be around in a couple ofeventsum around here in Berlin um startingfrom now on so keep your eyes open andum I'm also going to be at a lot ofmeetups so you can meet me in person andhopefully the rest of the team as wellandum I will also be in this Communityhanging hanging out with the vv8 fansand everyone else and thatthe perfect time for Duda introducehimselfhello everybody I'm dude I'm based herein Brazil and just as Marion but alittle bit early I also joined thereview gate and it's been a very funride so far uh learning a lot of courseas a a very full of potential uh uh toolthat can be used to amazing stuff justlike Ahmed showed us and I'll be I amthe Community Technical manager uhsupport uh so I'll be always there onthe on the forums and on also on theslack and on the documentation also withthe help of GP and Zayn and so whateverthing that you need in if I am able tosolve it and if I if I don't I also willbring data to our team so it's apleasure to be here and I hope to seeyou around there on the on the forums orhours like so please feel uh more thaninvited to join us therethank youawesome thank you Mary absolutely sogreat to have you all here you know it'snice to grow the family the team isgrowing the team is growingso now we set the stage for the nextpresent next fixing right yeahall right so next upgot Sebastian talking about what are youtalking about Sebastianoh yeah I wanted to talk to you allabout online workshops so it's it'spretty cool because both use and njthave been running workers for uh for alittle while alreadyum but in order to find them it was alittle bit tricky in the past becauseyou kind of have to find them like youwould announce them on Twitter or likeput it on LinkedIn or different placesand it was all about like um it's likeyeah can you discover those workshops soactually the two of you have been doinga pretty awesome job so far with runningliterally we're running those workshopsweekly so for anyone that's watching usright now if you're new to viviate it'sliterally an intro to within Workshopevery week that is Run online and oneweek is like more like a European slashAsian time zones where the other one isaround the uh time zones that aretraining for the Americasum so those are great workshops to joinand how do you find out about thoseworkers really straightforward you couldgo under developers and then intoworkshops and then you can see likethey're always like the the futureworkshops so for example if you'reinterested in a workshop with JPtomorrow that shows in my time so I canclick here and then you can go andregister yourself or for the workshop sojust drop us your name email and thenwe'll send you uh send you a link to theworkshop which will be pretty great anduh you know like then you'll get a smartpeople like Zen or JP for a full hour orsometimes more and a good thing aboutthis is as well that is a place for youto ask questions on how you do certainstuff rightum it's definitely recommended this oneto for anyone that's a beginner so ifyou have somebody in your team that'slearning with it send them over to thisoneum we're also thinking and already likesomewhat in in the Midway planning allthe types of workshops or more advancedtopicsum so if you have any opinions on whatkind of Workshop you'd love to see foryourselfum drop us a note either here duringthis session or maybe uh reach out to uson slack so yeah that's me and theworkshops awesome thank you if you wantthe smart workshops you go to JP'sworkshops if you want the fun ones youcome to mind okay that's that's how wedo it so it's almost exactly what I wasgoing to say Zen but um I was gonna sayfor you know actually learn stuff go toZen's just to listen to someone just goon on and on that's me and then I dolove to chat and and to Sebastian'spoint about coming in and askingquestions honestly one of the bestthings about this Workshop in Boston andI have said this is just the fact thatwe get to engage with users but like howthey're using wavier and we've likeactually ended up you know talking to anumber of people about and answering abunch of questions like not drink justduring the workshop but afterwards aswell because that particular use casesum and then they you know that wasn'tcovered in in our examples whateverbecause it was they were unique so yeahit's really it's a good time I'mhonestly both of us so you know we'renot we're not horrible people we thinkso good luck to have youthe fun thing is that we sort of have atemplate for those work shoes but wedon't uh and then each of you run thoseWorks in a very different way and I knowthat you you keep trying new stuff so itwouldn't even hurt someone to kind ofjoin both uh or something rightum but yeah it's pretty cool yeah it'slike a Pearl Jam concert every set'sdifferentsoyeah it's uh I I want to keep it thesame template and then I get bored thefirst time I deliver it and then I waslike okay how do I how do I make itbetter so every time you come you'll seea different demo or you'll see somesomething that's changed soum that's why we need those Advancedworkshops because if you get bored youknow you have to you know show it withmore advanced features and stuff rightyeah so we we were planning onum seeing what other Concepts we can gointo so for example just an hourworkshop on uh document chunking andhave a workshop on retrieval augmentedgeneration like all of these interestingConcepts thatumanother one could be like fine-tuningembedding models like there's questionsthat we get from the community uh overslacking over the Forum and it would beinteresting to just pick one and then doa div typemake it I think that would be prettyinteresting so those are coming as wellall right awesomeso this next topic is uh it's kind ofnear and dear to my heart because I'vebeen um learning from Abdel about thisand further for I don't know how manyOuija errors you've been kind of hearinghis thoughts through my voice but todayI wanted to welcome Abdel onto EVA Airfor the first time and so now you don'tget the second hand experience you getthe first hand experience from theprofessor himself so Abdel welcome andit's great to have you hereuh thanks and and thanks for for beingthe voice I think you've done very wellI thinkprobably it has heard better on yourvoice so let's seeuh so II I don't want to repeat everything youhave said because again you you havemade a terrific work think of theaddress very muchuh I just want toto talk about the last changes we didso we we releasedumproduct quantization some time ago inversion 118 it was on their experimentalflag because we knew it was not acomplete many things were still so manypieces had to to to come into into theirplacebut uh but we wanted to test it a bitand to to have some feedback uh so backin version 118 we did some testing andwe saw okay performance wise it'sworking fine but we are losing a lot ofrecall so the the the the the answers weare gettingis not well they are not as accurate aswe would expectand uhand then we analyze these and and weknew we could rescore all the data oncewe we have itbut but we still had a couple ofpolicies to follow like how however Manadoes it howAsians wpq does it like rescoring at theend and we wanted to to test everythingbefore before wea ship a complete solution and and wetake the experimental flag out of it soI have some charts maybe to to showwhere we were back in the 118 and wherewe are nowso this is this green curve so this is aqueries per second against recall sothis is how fast we we give an answerlike we we can we can serve 400 answersin the second or 100 answers in aqueries in a second and this is howaccurate our our answers are like a likeone is like everything is what should belike the the closest points that that weare trying to collect and this was ourresults no compression no PQ and this iswhat we get like with the relativelylow compression but but high enough soas to to compress that so this thisorange curve isSix Dimensions per segment meaning wehad likea 1 to 24 compression rate so if you hadlike 24 gigabytes of vectors suddenlyyou only need one gigabyte for storingthemumbut you see there was a huge price in inPrecision of the of the results and thenwe explore the the the different wayslikewe we could be rescoring like you knowI'll use your example like you have theaddress you don't have the streetnumbers you only have the streetuh okay it gives you an idea of thevectors you want to fetch it's it's evenmore than that if you live in a givenStreet let's say Let's uhcome back to this example when you applythe product quantization it's not likeyou are taking the street and leavingthe rest it's a vector and you have toapply some mathematics patients so youcould also uh add some noisein the street at your story it could benot the real street but the street nextto it and then you don't want to rely ahundred percenton the street you you want to give someroom for for for the noiseso ideally you should saywell is it iseveryone is like really silent I thinkthe thing where like I'm looking atother people's screens to certaininterrupt AB developers still talkingI think Abdel went to into like thecompress from 118 and that's their lowrecall I think I think he enabled PQwell while speaking Yeah the old versionthere we go did you just run into theold version of PQ of low Ricobenope nope he's still on the old versionyou have enough points and then you canyou cancollect the data the the so you cancheck all the enough points to to tohave a good uh result setbut how how do we do then we we take allthose vectors and wego to disk take the real representationof the vector recompute the distancesand take the finalso this this made us jump from hereto this range on Ricolike it's it's now really close to tothe to theuh on compress and then we also madesome improvements from from 118 to 121.now it's a bit hard to compare so thisis 118 no compression 121 no compressionthe green curve is a 118 no compressionthe blue curve is a 121 no compressionso you see there's no PQ there and stillthere's a huge difference and that'sbecause of the different improvementsthat we have introduced in in vv8 likegrcp grpyearuh PC supportlike the CMD optimizations on thedistances calculations which by the wayare not asupported for the compress case so westill have somemore research to do and and then if yousee the red curve now that's the thecompress on 121 is is in a good it'sreally close to the to the blueso we we believe it's it's reallyout of experimental we have fixed enoughbox and and I think it's well we believeit's safe to useuhwhen we made all those changes in 119 wethen realized okay this is going goodbutthe indexing time was still like almosttwice when you compressand we debug it a bit profile it and werealized okay there's a lot of distancecalculations between compressed vectorsandI don't want to get too technical nowbut but we have like this lookup tablewhere we put all the distances forcompressed vectors to to the queryvector and we did something similar forthe indexing like we have this Globallookup table where you compute distancesonce and you don't do it again everduring indexing you reuse it and nowwhen you index uhlet me see if I shrunk to the next yeahwhen you index so we try with spheredata set and with Wikipedia so we havedbpti collection of one million vectorsvectorized with the open AI Ada002so those are big vectors in 118 if youwould uh index your datacompress and uncompressed you have liketwice the time to index the data but in121 it's more or less the same actuallycompress is a little bit faster but butnot significantly faster so it's more orless the sameand the Improvement of course is so thebenefits are in the memory footprintwhere where you barely use mid 14 15 10of the memory you would have needed forthe for the normal use cases so forexample with sphere 1 billion objects wewent from 2.7 terabytes to uh 0.7terabytes like if maybe five times lessmemoryuh yeahthat's uh one of the one of the amazingthings about this so if can you go backto the first graph that you had therethis is a what's the compression ratiobetween the blue and the red light thatyou're showingit's like uh the the red curveneedsa 14 of the memory we need for the blue14 it was likesix and a halfgigabytes of memory against 900megabytes something like this yeah solike the fact that you're only payingthis much recall for that amount ofcompression and then depending on whatyour application is of courseif you look at this this is so awesomeyeah exactly 85 reduction in memoryfootprintum and the other thing that I wastalking to Abel about this is thatwe're not only making improvements onthat red line that blue line theuncompressed version is also beingimproved day in day out right so reallyfor the for Abdel who's working on thePQ stuffthe red line is chasing the blue lineand the blue line is getting better andbetter as well so uh it's uh it's quitea tall order so before it was closer andthen we made the the simdi improvementsuh like Abdul mentioned in the blue lineimproved even more right soum like for for me if like this isanother thing I guess we're going to bereleasing a blog post that has all thesedetails uh in the in the next couple ofweeks so look out for that if you wantto if you want to then learn all thesedetails from Abdelum but what's interesting isnow you you really have a um a validchoice and going full PQum and you can you can kind of look andsee what your data is equivalent to interms of the tests that we've doneand see how much kind of recall you'reuh paying for the up to 80 90 reductionin in memory footprint and yeah I I alsowanted to say here about the price youpay in recall that so when when wecompare we restore down so during thesearch or we can rescore at the end wesaw okay the the curve is slightlyhigher I mean the the recall was exactexactly the same as uncompressed if wewould havea risk or during the search but then theperformance penalty was higher and withthis we you have the flexibility toincrease your parameters your searchparameters like your EF parameter andyou can still get the recall you want ata lower price in performance this isanother way also to to read it you youdon't have to payin recall if you want a better recallyou still so you need to use a higher EFparameter compare to the uncompressedversion okay and then you might mightlose a fewmicroseconds or or maybe one millisecondbut but that's it that you still have aan accurate solution I see and and bythe way these charts uh so I I will alsotalk about how to Benchmark your data incase you you have your own data and youwant to see how how it goes we are usingscripts that are in the chaos pipelinecurrently in vv8so I I willput all the information you would needto to replicate these experiments withyour own data or with whatever data youyou need to to run the experiments yeahyeah that's going to be awesomeI think so a lot of the questions thatwe get especially after we ran thesphere experiment where people trying toreplicate the sphere experiment and nowlike we're gonna we're gonna release thecode that you can use to kind of plugand play your own data set and try withPQ without PQ and then you canand then if you're modifying theparameters of hnsw to to get some of therecall backum that's where I think it'll be superuseful right because then now you canfine tune some of the parameters of PQas well as hnsw and then you can seewhat amount of compression works foryour data set that'll be awesome yeahone thing that we didn't cover yetum sorry JPum it's because we always talk like wetalk about performance and like recalland everything but like I think um andit's great that we have a met herebecause to people that build with wemade that also means that financiallyyou can build bigger Solutions maybelike maybe before we say like hey 100million that was a wild thing now with85 savings on the same setupum I could throw 700 million vectorsrightum and then so you could kind of go likeokay not only can I handle like waybigger data set my speeds are even goingup but I'm not spending more on Hardwarelike this is this is so incredibleum so there's definitely a great greatopportunity uh for you to play becauselike if you're like on a small data setlike you're like half a million objectsyes it is a bit of an improvement butwhen you deal with like huge cases likethis is like a wow thing and then youcould either go like I could slash mycosts a lot because I don't need so muchHardware or I could go like with mycourse I could go for bigger cases andthis is I think this is greatand I'm not I'm pretty sure I met youalready messaging your engineers goinglike yep get on the latest versionyeah so for Ahmed I think there's twointeresting things there's themulti-tenancy update and then the PQupdate andso yeah lots of lots of interestingthings which is a great segue to JPwho's going to be talking about some ofthese interesting updates JP what do youwhat are you bringing us today fabulousI want uh I'll be pretty quick but yeahthat video really reminded uh so the thetalk really reminded me of you know keepyour vb8 versions up to date rightbecause a lot of people ask us aboutlike oh I'm having problem XYZ and quiteoften the solution is oh have you triedthe latest version because we've madeimprovements and what have you and thisis like an exam and those curves withthe uncompressed data is a big exampleof that because even if you weren'tusing PQ just by updating the latestversion you get huge performance gainslike the two uncompressed curves arelike just wildly different places toeach otherum so that's that's really cool um butthen if you can share the screen thatI've got openI can talk to 121 oh that's interestingdid that sit around your screen as welllike what's happening is yeah I jittereda little bit I don't know why itvibrated uh just just very excited Zenjust very excitedum so 121 came out last week it is nowavailable on WCS as well and you'd haveseen some social messages so if youreally you know if you like this cuteleviate guyum check that out as well but there area fewum features here that are really reallyinteresting so I'll go through them oneby one fairly quickly so we've got newcontains any contains all operators thisis syntactic sugar but what it reallydoes is I actually scroll down to theright section before I talk about itum but what it does is instead of havingto have a bunch of logic combinations oflogical operators like whether it's andsor ORS this allows you to stream likethat and it might when I describe it notlike sound like a big deal because youknow all this is doing the same thingbut if you're writing code or if you'rereading it later it will just like youknow it would be easier to ride morelikely debug free and easier tounderstand the logic internally what'sgoing on soum and it doesn't really change anythingelse other than the fact that I'll usethe graphql example here you're justusing a different operator right hereand in terms of contains any this willreplace a series of um or statementswhich we've all written long boringinvolved um logical combinations Statesbefore you know whether from Excel or inactual programming languages and whatnotso this will make that a lot easier sothat's contains any and contains allright and it's now I believe supportedin all of our client libraries as wellso please check that out cool so that'sthat one and the other one and youtouched on it earlier then in terms ofreally irrelevance time and I'm sureyou'll you know I see you sitting up onit about the multi-tenancy improvementsand this is a cool one so when we launchmulti-tenancy we talked about scalingaspects of it right how many you know asa rule of thumb how many tenants can wesupport per node and whatnot now whatwe've done with this update or uh not meI didn't do any of it but the team hasdone with this update has been tointroduce the ability to activate ordeactivate tenant shards each tenant isa Shard and what this allows you to dois to say if you have a million usersand half of them are inactive users youcan just switch them not necessarily offin terms of deleting them but you canturn them into the deactivated users andthey'll take up no memory footprintbasically right so you'll store all thedata you can activate them if they docome back online but again it's a reallyconvenient way to scale without kind ofwasting Hardware resources on data andmemory footprint that you don't needum so I believe it's somewhatexperimental so in the sense that theAPI might change a little bit I believethere are more States coming and so onbut this is really really cool so againif you're you know building somethingwith a bunch of tenants and you knowthis is like going to be a really goodcost saving and useful feature for you Ithink I'm going to scroll through allthe pros and there's been aperformance Improvement in terms of likehow the system manageskind of coordinating all these differentoperations going on for multi-tenancybecause there's you knowlarge scale less attendance lots ofthings needs to be done so basicallythat's an under the hood improvementthough so again if you upgrade from 120to 121 you get this for free right andwho doesn't like free stuffOkay so we've got new modules and thenI'll throw this back to you uh when I'mdone rambling and the first one is atext to back GPT for all module we'vegot the texture back contextreme moduleas a local vectorizer and that workswell but it's kind of an older model soperhaps it's not as performant as someof the more modern models and there wasone solution of to to that is to use thetext-to-back Transformers module withwhich you can use any of the modernTransformer architectures nowum obviously then menu views use that orknow about it know that you need a GPUyou kind of do really data GPU if youwant to do any kind of massive scalevectorization on it but this module isoptimized for CPU use so it's got one ofthe mini LM modules available for it andwith this you can get really really fastvectorization and or inference whicheverway you want to call it performance outof just the CPU so encourage you tocheck that out togetherand the next one of course we're reallyexcited about is the multi-teve finemodule I can see Zen just vibrating ortutoring with excitement there and thatallows us to use the bind model toprocess multi-model dataand um and then we'll you know show acool demo after thisum then gets just all the fun stuff buthere's a little preview so if you lookat the blog postum there's a little demo here of likeusing uh is it sound to retrieve imagesand a video to retrieve another image isthat right yeah so this one I played theyou can play the uh file at the topthereum yeah there's a little there so that'sthe sound of a car honking and then thisis the image that comes backum and I'll show in the demo what whatother things you can doum theI I guess I'll go into it when I when Igo into the demo otherwise I'm going tostart rambling and I won't stop exactlyit's my time now it's that go awayum it probably came up with this carbecause sports cars you know they justrun you over so uh yeah listen toSebastian you need to pay us more for usto put Pitch the Bugattis in heremanI'm getting a playlist just just for apicture yeah well I triedum so there's that and then there's acouple other things I'll just go throughquickly so there's been a suite ofperformance improvements under the hoodum so you can see the little waviatemascot being extremely happyum one of them that is not entirelyunder the hood is the virtual memoryaccess so mmap is the existing method orthe existing function that's being usedto map virtual memory and useum itcan have some potential challenges ifyou start to have like basicallysignificant load so we've introducedthis option under the hood to use periodum so default doesn't change so if youdon't do anything nothing changes but ifthis is a potential challenge for youyou can try out the solutionum so we mentioned simply operationsbefore and for those of you like me whomight not necessarily know what CMD isit's a basically parallelsparallelization technique in processingum so if you've you know if you're asold as me and and seeing things like MMXon stickers it's kind of like the samething on the old Intel chips now this isalready available on um Intel processorsbut we've added this for um 64processors so that's really cool andagain upgrade you get free performanceimprovementsI feel like a salespersonum and I've dealt with no this isuh yeah you know I'll wait thereum and we're gonna get we get best teamdeath improvements in terms of how thevector indexesum basically built and and how it's usedso we've got these two key improvementsin terms of How It's encoded and interms of How It's accessed and what'savailable when to different processes sothese are under the hood improvementsum and it'll just basically make wavy8go even faster which is really reallyneatum one change that you probably want tobe mindful of is the backups there's acouple of things hereone highlight that you should know isthat 121 backups cannot be used in 120so if my sales pitch is successful andyou do upgrade before you upgrade itmight be a good idea to produce a 120backup in case you do think you mightwant to roll back you know you knowproduction system or what have youbecause there are a whole bunch ofimprovements like compression that'llmake the backups they think cheapercertainly for cloud providers andpotentially faster I have to check butit's not backwards compatible so backupyour data and upgrade if you think youmight be rolling back the most importantthing about backups is themyeah yeah make sure you back up to amedium that you can useum uh so yeah and and one small thingwhich is also but important is a hybridsearch algorithm refinement so with thenew hybrid ranking algorithm that weintroduced in 120 I believe and that wasto do it the way it was scoredum there was a use case where if youretrieved on your small set of data theresults might fluctuate probably morethan you might like so we've introducedthis little thing where even if you askthe like three objects we've yet willgrab a hundred right and then calculatethe scores and just give you back thethe three just because that stabilizesthe way the scores are calculatedum so you won't see it um you'llprobably just notice that if you'reusing theum relative score Fusion I think is thealgorithm name if you're using that ifthe score is a little bit more stablethan beforeum and so it'll be perhaps a little bitmore intuitive when you look at thescoresso yeah that's kind of it for meum it's a bit of a lightning round butagain it's available in WCS it'savailable open source um it's reallycool it's fast it's got all these newbells and whistles on it so againum yeah please try it out and let usknowawesome thank you I'm sold I'm actuallyusing it on this computer right now yeahI can prove it what are you doing withit Zen yeah let me show you let's see ohwow that's really coolso what I wanted to talk about was umone specific module so I've been playingaround with this um for a whilelet me show you guys here so this demois not going to be as cool as the demothat we saw earlier uh from Ahmed butyou can you can take the multi-directbind module and you can kind ofincrementally uh use it to to getsomethingum that that could be as cool you'regonna have to put a lot of work in butum let me show you a little bit of thecapability of the multi-davecbidebefore I go into the demo so the modelitself has the ability to encode sevendifferent modalities and that means thatyou can perform any to any modalitysearch right so you can pass in text andsearch for text audio video images andthen there's a bunch of other modalitiesbut these are the exciting ones and thenyou can do that with anything so yourquery can be any of these modalities aswell and the output can be at any of theuh modalities so that's what I mean byany to any searchso the two modalities and if I if I wasgoing to show you all the combinationswe'd be here all day so let me just showyou some of the most excitingcombinationsum so what I did here is I put togethera notebookuh to show you how easy it is right souh setup is pretty straightforward I'vegot this running locally on my computerum I've created a schema this one hastwo classes one where I'm storing imagesand another one where I'm storing audiouh depending on your use case you canhave one class that stores uh all themodalities or multiple classes thatstore different onesum but for my use case I'm going to showyou two different types of searches soone over image and one over audio so I'madding the I'm adding the dataseparatelyand then I've got a bunch of helperfunctions here to kind of make theprocess a little easierso then you go in you add all the imagesso I've got I think 20 25 images so it'sa toy example maybe next time I'mpreparing a talk so for that one I'llhave a real like a scalable exampleum and then I add the audio file so I'vegot a bunch of audio files that I scrapefrom the internetand then now we can perform first I'llshow you uh text image audio video toimage searchso hereyou can go in and let's say we searchfor the concept A sparse Market thiscomes back so this is nothing new youcould do this with clipum and then this works just as wellactually the image bind module is builton top of the clip module so the theimage and the text modalities that ituses are clipso um this works as well as the clipmodule itself right so there's all oftheseand then we can go to image to imagesearch which you can also do with theclip moduleso here the formatting is a bit wonkybut this is the query image and then Ican show you here this is the queryimage and then you get I took threeresponse images and I and I squishedthem together so you can see relevantthings here if this is your query imageyou get the response image over hereif this is a query image then you getresponse imagesum no this is this is all old stuffright so let me show you new stuffso now you can play an audio sound let'ssay you wanted to query with this audioand I don't know if this will play foryou but let me try itno did you guys hear that nope okay sodelete I'll release it yeah so it's it'sI'm not I'm not gonna so this isThe Voiceso this is a car uh honking and you haveto trust me and then I'll and I'll openand then so this will this is what youget back when you do that which isinteresting because you get the car butthen you also get the city which iswhere now this demo is not as heavyhitting as if you if you could haveheard it but this is a lion roaringand you get all this stuff backand then you can keep playing aroundwith this so I've had a lot of fun withthisum I'll release this uh notebookafterwards so you can play around withthis as well you can kind of swap in andout uh the um the files that you'reputting inand then you can also do near videosearch so herethis one you'll be able to see so I'vegot this uh video that's playing uh noaudio on this one and then when you yourquery is a video it goes in and this iswhat you get back as response imagesum now keep in mind in this class I onlyhave images so it can only give me backimages if I had multiple modalitiesstored in this class then I would beable to get back other things as wellumyeah so if it's your query video you cango through this we get this responseif your query video is a bunch of lionsyou getspecand then it's pretty amazingyeah so it's kind of the first time Isaw it I was wowed and then I played aplayed around with it for like two weeksthe other thing that you can do so thisis just images right you're getting backimagesum the other thing you can do which isreally cool isuh one second let me scroll hereyour video searchso then the other class I put in a bunchof audio files solet me scroll down to thisokayum so herethethe query is this uh text so animals ona farm and it retrieves the audio soundthat's most related to the animals on afarm okay and this isum you won't be able to hear this butthis is a um a a rooster in the morningokayum so you can play around with that aswelland then if you can query with an imagethis is yeah I'm not going to make thesound oh come on maybe next time you'reon the friends hereso if this is your query image you getthe audio of uh so in this case actuallyit didn't return the audio of abadminton that's because I had audio ofbadminton in the database as well butapparently in this image the man is morerelevant than the fact that he's playinga badminton so it it sent me uh the uhaudio of a of a man sneezing I had boththings in my database and apparentlythat was closer in Vector space so I gota true hereI I made that sound that countsum and then you can do query to queryright so something like a Shazam appwhere if I play a tune it will be ableto retrieve a song for me this one Iplayed a tune of a dog barking and thenit it barks back at meso it plays uh another uh anotherum audio sound hereand then the last one so we couldfinally uh get an answer to what did thefox sayyeah but it'll be in Fox speak soso I these these two dogs are kind ofconversing with each other inmulti-dimensional space I don't knowwhat they're talking about but it'spretty interesting and then the last onehere if you playum if I play a video so if this is myquery the entire video I can get backum the a an audio sound here which isjust a school belt ringing right whichwas the closest thing to to a classroomso yeahJPM yeahum and each input here is being embeddedinto like it's been converted into oneembedding rightyes so there'sum there's multiple models there's sixdifferent models the one for image andvideo is the same so that's why you haveseven modality six modelsum so the interesting part here is thatyou have six different embedding spacesbut each one of them is kind of bindedtogether that's why it's called imagebind by the representation of clip soclip understands words and images reallywell and it and the paper details thisthey use Clips understanding of imagesand words to pull in the representationsof audio video all of these othermodalities to be close to clip and sothat's why even if you even though youhave all these multiple modalities if Isend in a video it goes through aseparate model if I send an audio itgoes through a separate modelbut the embedding space of all thesemodalitiesum it kind of talks to each other in thetraining uh in the training Loop sothat's why you can kind of use these sixsix models together at query time yeahand I guess from a user perspective likehow you decide to chunk if you have amovie or if you have like you know likeI never thought about you have anearnings call right how you chunk thatwould be really important because youbasically couldn't you know or averageVector for that segment so if you havetwo very just separate scenes after ascene transition that might not be whatyou want you want to have some way ofintelligently chunking that informationsomewhere which would be kind of youknow very important depending on whetherit's audio or video or combination ofbothum it'll be like a fairly significantdecision as to how you decide to do thatyeah so if you wanted to so this iswhere chunking gets really interestingso if I play thisum video herethis uh this video is entirely about theclassroom right but if for some reasonpart way through this video you had acar or something like thisum then it wouldn't work right becausethen you're averaging you're generatingone vector which is the average over 21seconds which is a lot and you can readthis in the papers as well but persecond you generate two frames so youget two image vectors per uh per uhSecond and then you do that over 21seconds and you take the average overall of them so you kind of Squishtogether all these representations ifyou have very uh diverse frames in avideo it's going to be very difficultum and this is where uh ahmed's umpresentation comes in right so you haveto do a lot more to to deal with thatyou have to do very interesting kind ofchecking strategies and and otheralgorithms to deal with that but out ofthe box the the model itself just kindof squishes the entire thing togetherif you have a big video you probably dowant itum you want to kind of semanticallyChunk so that you have one concept pervectorthat's awesomeum I mean the cool thing is that sorryum because I run I've been playing thethe demo as well with the model and atone point I use as an input a picturethat we took from like uh basically ujpMarion and like uh Derek and Tommy likewere together and we took a picturetogether and we also I think Doug washolding his dog and the interestingthing was that like when I presentedthis uh picture for search the outputthat I got back were pictures of peoplelike people Gatherings and there's alsopictures of dogsum so the model was able to kind of likerecognize like oh yeah this content isimportantyeah we didn't have any meerkats in thedata set but like uhVasco is here with me and he's sad youknow he's depressed now he's like whatdo you mean no meerkatsyeah we're gonna change that demo fornext timethe other interesting thing about thisis that um this has only been trained onkind of publicly available data so youcan I think this was trained on ninedifferent data sets that were stitchedtogetherum but if you want to use it for likevery specific applicationsum then it won't know about those ofcourse and this is goes into what Emmettwas talking about for that purpose youhave to fine-tune the model to to learnabout A New Concept and then it'll beable to associate that New Concept withum other Concepts that it already has inits embedding space and that's where Ithink the potential for this can gothrough the roof right it's reallyusable out of the box it knows about alot of general concepts but if you havea proprietary thing that that only yourEnterprise data hasthen you can actually fine-tune themodel and then use it before you feeddata into your vector database and thennow you have kind of customizedmultimodal multimodal search which Ithink the potential for that is uh isreally greatall right that's everything for me folksand then do you think that to yourselfas a host no sorry yeah I'm gonna I'mgonna throw it back to my I'm gonnathrow it back to Sebastian to round usoffwait me again okayum so thank you all for listening forwatching us if you enjoyed this videogive us a likeum definitely come back for the nextepisode in a month we'll do it againum if you have an exciting demo to showoff definitely would like to see youum a big big thank you to Ahmed for uhfor his super nice demo our superexciting uh to see what you built and umyeah definitely looking forward to seemore of your work and what we want cando I definitely recommend to anyonewatching here check uh check B1 becausethat's an amazing companyum super exciting about that finallygetting the real real update not to Zenproxyum so it's nice always nice to have youhere my spider brotherum you know and uh big big welcome fordinner and money in the new starters soum yeah and JP and then keep keepkicking and screaming you know maybe oneday uh you wear me off and I'll get youthat pay rate so thank you for watchingand see you next month and yeah oncemore thank you
