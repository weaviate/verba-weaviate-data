{"text": "Thank you for watching the 17th Weaviate Podcast with Kyle Lo! Vector Search enables us to find semantically similar items in ... \n[Music] \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nlistening to the vva podcast i'm super \nexcited to be welcoming kyle lowe a \nresearch scientist at the allen \ninstitute of artificial intelligence \nkyle's work on applying nlp tools the \napplication of scientific literature \nmining has captured my interest honestly \nmore than anything else in deep learning \nresearch to give a quick preview kyle \nhas worked on papers such as cybert a \npre-trained language model for \nscientific text tldr extreme \nsummarization of scientific documents \nfact or fiction verifying scientific \nclaims and a data set of information \nseeking questions and answers anchored \nin research papers just to give you a \nquick sense of some of the things that \nkyle has worked on in the space of \nscientific literature mining science is \nbecoming more connected and open which \nis good but exhausting for researchers \ntrying to keep up with it kyle and \ncollaborators are developing models for \ntasks such as summarization question \nanswering and even fact verification \nthat facilitate this problem of keeping \nup with the literature and in my view \nwill greatly impact the efficiency of \nscience kyle shared his insights in the \npodcast on building these kinds of data \nsets and the lessons learned in applying \ncutting edge deep learning algorithms to \nthese problems to return to wev8 and \nvector search a bit i first became aware \nof vector search when researching deep \nlearning applications for covid19 i saw \nthe co-search system from salesforce \nresearch which uses vector embeddings of \nqueries to match them with vector \nembeddings of scientific documents many \nof the data sets kyle has worked on are \navailable on hugging face data sets and \ncan quickly be loaded into we va to \nexplore vector search in scientific \nliterature mining so with that said \nenough for me i really hope you enjoy \nthe podcast and as a quick reminder if \nyou enjoy this topic you may also like \nour second we vva podcast with charles \npierce who similarly discusses his work \non scientific literature mining hey kyle \nthank you so much for doing the we vva \npodcast hey uh good to be here thanks \nfor inviting me so i think a really \ngreat topic to start this off would be \nif you could open us up with what is \nscientific literature mining and just \nthis kind of problem \nyeah so scientific literature mining is \num essentially like a class uh \nthe goal is to take the breadth of \nscientific literature that scholars have \ndifficulty keeping up to date with and \nreading everything that's being \npublished and trying to \nuh apply text mining techniques nlp \ntechniques um \nthat people have been developing to try \nto make scientists and scholars lives \neasier \nso this can be through \nextracting useful bits of information \nfrom these papers i could be summarizing \nthese papers it could be building tools \nthat help scientists discover um what's \nthe right papers or discover new papers \nthat they wouldn't have read ordinarily \nit's kind of this broad field of trying \nto make sense of large amounts of useful \ntext \nyeah i think it's one of the most \ninteresting applications out there and i \ni personally have definitely seen this \nproblem of trying to keep up with the \ninformation overload of trying to keep \nup with all the cutting edge sciences \nis such a daunting task can you tell me \nabout your kind of progression in your \ncareer and what led you to scientific \nliterature mining and kind of how you \nuse your own intuition of kind of like \nthis meta thing of being a scientist and \nthen studying the \ninformation acquisition process of \nleveling up your own sort of skills as a \nscientist yeah that's interesting so i \ndid kind of stumble into this field um \nlike when i joined the the when i joined \nai 2 um i joined right into this somatic \nscholar team and i had like no idea i \nhad no nlp experience i had no text \nmining experience um \ni was just interested like um \ni liked \ni liked reading papers um like uh i had \nkept up kind of in my professional \ncareer uh still reading stats papers \nmachine learning papers um \nand \nuh so i guess there was always still a \nlittle bit of like attachment to like oh \nit would be nice if this was easier \nbecause reading papers and keeping with \npapers is hard um \nand uh so the \nwhen i joined and they basically pitched \nme this idea of like we'd be building \ntools that makes this thing make this \nlife easier i was like i could use these \nthese things that we built this is \namazing and that's kind of how i got \nstarted in it because it's like an easy \nsell \num \nand uh i guess like \nyeah in terms of like the relationship \nthe the kind of the interesting \ncircumstance of like i'm also like a \nuser of the tools that we're like trying \nto develop um \nit definitely makes \nuh \nthere's some things that are definitely \neasier because you stay motivated a lot \nbecause it's like at the worst case um \nwhatever you build there's at least out \nat least i'll want to use it even if \nnobody else wants to use it it'll at \nleast be useful for me probably and so \num \nuh you know it's like i don't have to \nspeculate too much um and maybe there's \nlike you know like \n10 people out there who also have like \nthe similar uh way of consuming research \nas i do so there's not as much worry \nthat i'm like \nhallucinating a task or a tool that \nnobody \nwould possibly use um \nthere's always a little bit of \nconfidence there \nand \nthough there are times where it's like \nam i designing systems or am i working \non problems that are really specific to \nme \nand like nobody and like i really \ntailored to like how i do research or \nhow i consume literature and like maybe \nit won't generalize to other people so \nthere's that kind of balance \nand \nbefore kind of stepping back and getting \ninto concrete works like you know cyborg \nbiobird and all sorts of the things \nyou've done that we're going to get into \ni do want to kind of stay on this a \nlittle more and ask this kind of \nquestion about \nyou know you're describing say it \nreminds me of like developer tools where \nyou're building something that you \nyourself would use and it really helps \nyou guide the intuition and something \ni've always been curious about as i've \nbeen reading and i've read quite a few \nof your papers now about uh doing the \nscientific literature mining and i'm \ncurious about like the biomedical domain \ncompared to the deep learning domain and \ni know you have a paper uh q asper \ninformation seeking that is annotated \nnlp papers compared to a lot of this \nbiomedical stuff so i'm curious from \nyour perspective on developing \nscientific literature mining as you say \nlike i'm the user that helps me guide my \nintuition do you think that it's better \nto make progress on like \nyou know kind of the recursion again of \nnlp for nlp papers or this kind of nlp \nfor uh biomedical or say physics \nchemistry like that kind of thing \nyeah so this is this is a really um we \ncould talk for a real long time about \nthis because i think this is also like a \nsubject of debates on that team um \nthere's a \nwhether we a lot of projects um \nthat i work on like i guess like my team \nworks on \nwe try to work on techniques that are \nfairly general so it's like not \nnecessarily specific to biomedical \npapers or like you know calling it \nbiomedical papers is actually overly \nbroad it's like half of our half of \nliterature is like biomedical so at \nany one sub subfield is bigger than all \nof nlp combined so it's like um \nuh working on just like nlp paper so \nworking on just like ai papers computer \nscience papers this only we all have \nlike two million of these um biomedical \nwe have like 40 million of these papers \num \nso \num \nworking on any one \ntargeted field um the more you focus on \none \ntargeted field \ni think you start \ndiscovering really interesting phenomena \nthat are specific to that field \nand you start um and \nthings that are like really critical to \nresolve \nfor there to be adoption by people in \nthat field \num so like \nfor example i i just was dealing with \nthis uh recently um \neven the basic task of just like \nextracting references from a paper like \nthe bibliography section extracting \nreferences from paper and then linking \nthem to a database of \nknown papers \nand that's how systems like smash \nscholar google scholar web of science \nlike all these pubmed even like all a \nlot of these \naggregators that report citation \nstatistics either they get it directly \nas metadata from publishers or they have \nto extract it and link it themselves \nbut physics papers a lot of them don't \ninclude titles \nin their bibliography entries and so \nif you develop a tool that's just \nlooking at biomedical papers or computer \nscience papers you would develop a tool \nto think actually title linking is like \njust matching based on title gives you \nreally really good performance um and \nthen you would completely like not build \nanything that's useful for \nthe physics domain and so \num it's like these kind of like little \ndetails as soon as you start focusing on \nparticular disciplines um \nyou you realize that like this is like \nit's like \nmake a break it's like table stakes if \nyou don't resolve this thing nobody in \nthat community will use your tool um \nbut \nuh \nbut the problem with this is like is \nthis like a scalable way of doing \nresearch like you know like you could \nimagine like discovering a lot more more \nwith these things um you can spend \nalmost all of your time uh trying to \njust like deal with this deal with this \nand kind of doing uh new tasks each time \nyou try to adopt like break into a new \ndiscipline uh \nso \nthere's a little bit of a juggle of like \nshould i focus on biomedical only um if \ni focus on biomarker only you know it or \nlike computer science only it's like a \nit's a familiar domain i have a lot more \nof experience i can build tools that \nwork for this \nbut if i spend too much time just \nfocusing on this \nwhen i is it like like is it like \nredoing most of it uh when i when i jump \nto another when i jump to another \ndiscipline or are my techniques actually \nfairly \napplicable with minor minor tweaks um as \ni moved into some of this discipline so \num \n[Music] \nyeah i guess different people on the \nteam have like different strategies \nabout what they feel safe committing to \num early on uh \nfor like i'm just gonna specialize on \nthis discipline and hopefully it'll \ngeneralize later and other people go \nlike actually no i'm gonna start my \nprojects \ntrying to pick three diverse disciplines \nand i'm just making sure my tools work \nacross all three even if that means like \na lot more upfront investment \ninteresting so it sounds like uh you \nknow like different disciplines of \nscience have different challenges of \nreproducibility and different challenges \nof communication as you mentioned the \ntitle linking for physics papers is uh \ndifferent from say computer science \npapers and um and maybe we could step a \nlittle back from the idea of say \ndesigning very specific tasks for \nparticular domains but if we could kind \nof say that this general framework of \nsay question answering or summarization \nis a \nperfect task set up let's say and it's \nall about uh \njust the particulars of the domains and \nso i kind of want to come into this \ntopic of data domain uh domain \nadaptations say maybe things like \nsemantic drift as like the meanings of \nwords change as you go from say \nwikipedia and then into uh \ndeep learning papers where maybe some \nword has some kind of different meaning \nso i i kind of really want to ask you \nabout this origin of i think you were \none of the first authors that did uh \nlike bio bert cyber this kind of um \nlanguage where it's data domain bert to \ncommunicate this idea of it's the burt \nalgorithm but it's been trained on this \nparticular data domain \nyeah yeah so um i think bio bert was \nfrom jin hyuk lee and others at uh korea \nuniversity and uh \nyeah no no problem there they did \nexcellent work um we were working on \ncyber at roughly around the same time \nand then \nwhere we were kind of going across just \nlike everything that we had in spanish \ncolor um \nand \ni guess like both of our groups were \nsort of stumbling to like this idea of \nlike \num \nwhat \nit's it's like impractical to to like \ntrain a bird from scratch really um \nwhich is like a train retrain a \nperfection each time you have a new \ndiscipline you gotta train bird from \nscratch again um \nbut someone had to like kind of go \nthrough that kind of mostly engineering \nwork to to \nto prove it out um i think at the time \nit was actually kind of \nuh those decent amount of pushback \nactually unlike going going down that \nroute like now we know that i was like \nthat was a good idea but at the time it \nwas just like \nwhy do you need that like are \num \nwhat's \nit's it's a lot of effort to try to kind \nof wrangle google's like kind of early \ntensor like like like kind of first \nversion of vert code um this is like pre \nhugging face era \nand uh \nand it wasn't clear \nwhy \npeople needed um \nthese like kind of discipline specific \nor domain-specific birds um \nbecause bird was trained on like such a \nwide crawl of of of different link like \nlanguage like documents um \nand \nuh \nmaybe i mean you could definitely make \nthe case at the time i think like of \nlike different language birds that \nthey're so different that obviously you \nneeded but like scientific texts \nprobably some scientific texts leaked \ninto the bird training corpus like why \nwhy do we need this specialized thing so \nthat was kind of the motivation for this \nit's like \nare we \ndo we believe in this idea that like \nactually no science is hard enough \nwhere just training on like wikipedia \nand like reddit crawls uh is \ninsufficient for picking up kind of the \nthe type of language that's used inside \nof the text and at least people on our \nteam and people at korea university \nbelieved in this uh that it was \ndifferent enough to invest in that \nrebuilding of from from scratch or at \nleast like spending a lot of effort \nadapting a bird \num \nyeah i think that was \nmostly an engineering effort and the \ntypes of things we found was like \nsurprisingly um there's more similarity \nbetween these disciplines than we \nthought um and i think we know more and \nmore nowadays that actually \num \nvocabulary is one of those things that \nlike \nyou can get away with like not worrying \nnot trying to retrain your vocabulary um \nwe like found \nbiobert actually does really well in \nbiomedical \ntasks um \neven with the original burt like kind of \nwiki trained vocabulary so it's like \nthat's fine um obviously there's been \nnewer bio births like from msr there's \nlike i think there's like pubmed burt \nand there's like \nuh there's like \ntwo or three of these at this point i \ndon't remember which there's so many \nlike kind of clinical bert i think um \nand \nsome of them have retained vocabulary \nsome of them don't reaching vocabulary \nit's kind of unclear it's not as like \nobvious \nto us like what's the impact of having \nlike a specialized vocabulary um and \nseibert's \nuh results were also just like the \nvocabulary is like the performance boost \nwas \nso small that like we weren't even sure \nif it's significant or if it was like \ndidn't matter because it weren't like \nlike just like rebuilding upper from \nscratch because those are really \nexpensive um \nbut so there's something else that's \nhappening that's not vocabulary like \nit's some something but like \nthe performance there was substantial \nperformance boost on these scientific \ntasks these biomedical tests \nfrom adapting a \nregular burp to these uh to our \ndisciplines but \num it wasn't a vocabulary it's in like \nit's in something else in in the weights \nor something i don't know um \nso \nyeah i think the we've had some \nfollow-up work in in this space too with \nlike domain adaptation but \num i think there's still room for a lot \nmore study on like \nwhy is scientific text \ndifferent or actually in what ways is \nactually maybe just the same and we \ndon't have to spend \nuh like a ton of time \nadapting these bird models to handle \neverything maybe just the bits that are \nthat are particularly particularly \ndifferent particularly different in \nscientific text \num so \nyeah that's extremely interesting and i \nat the vocabulary tokenization level i \nguess maybe like if you have unknown \ntokens like maybe i don't know like \nlet's pretend like convalescent plasma \ntherapy out all right some phrase like \nsome gene or something like that right \nnever appears in wikipedia so it's not \neven token it's unknown and then you \ncompletely lose the info and it makes a \nlot of sense why that would be a \nhorrible \nuh information loss from wikipedia to \nthe \nbiomedical papers and yeah i agree with \nyou i think the like it's more of that \nlike the latent representations \nthat it can do that kind of reasoning \nright with that kind of thing \nand uh so one other thing i wanted to \nask you about on this topic is what what \nyour take is on you know prompting gbt3 \nto try to get it to be knowledgeable \nabout scientific text do you think that \nyeah so we have been playing wikividi \niii quite a bit uh it is it is \nit is like exceptional it is it's \nactually kind of \num \nshockingly like it just behaves so \ndifferently from from \nfrom models that we've we've dealt with \nin the past um \ni think like the like one one of the \nmost fascinating things about it was \nlike \nuh i think you could prompt it for for a \nparticular behav like um for a response \nwhere the response was like a list \nlike a little establishment oh like it \nwould say something like um \nuh here's three reasons why and then it \nactually like maintains coherency it \nlike it actually looks like bullet one \nlist something bullet two lists \nsomething and sometimes it might even \nlike refer back to oh yeah as a chain on \nto like kind of bullet two something \nsomething like there's there's like \ni've never seen that kind of like self \nfresh referential um behavior in in in \ngenerative models prior to gpd3 \num \nat the time i yeah and then and then \num \nbut \nit definitely doesn't still doesn't work \non on scientific pe tests \num \nwe've been using it for various projects \nlike \nuh trying to generate concepts like \ndescriptions for concepts \nlike technical jargon we've been using \nit for summarization we've been using it \nfor \nactually for just for extractive qa or \neven attractive keyway with from short \nsnippets um \nand there's definitely \nlike it it definitely \ndoesn't work \nit works reasonably well but it doesn't \nwork comp as well as just like kind of \nmore accessible models just like take \nbart and then fine tune it on a little \nbit of data and it'll outperform uh sort \nof just like this pure zero shot prompt \nbased uh gpd3 model so \num it's definitely not solved everything \nuh the really cool stuff is it seems \nreally good at doing kind of mechanical \noperations \num \nso if you ask it explicitly to \nsynthesize like a tldr \nuh from some input it's pretty good at \nthat i think it's because tldr \ngeneration fundamentally is very much \nlike a pick and choose these things and \nand you can do a lot of copying from the \ncontext that you supply and and for the \nmost part those tlr summaries are \nwill look pretty good um so it's \nactually quite good at that um it's \nquite good at like kind of rewriting \num so scientific text if you just try to \nconsume like \ndefinitions of terms if it's just like \nextracted context \num you'll have a lot of these \nfor example something something \nsomething or like \nas we mentioned before it's like these \nkind of dangling phrases where if you \njust remove these kind of phrases these \nextra punctuation ones stuff like that \nit would actually look pretty good \nthe end result will actually look pretty \ngood and gpd3 is pretty good at these \ntypes of mechanical operations just like \ncleaning up text to be somewhat \nself-contained \num \nbut anything beyond that uh i think our \nteam \nwould be hesitant to actually like put \nthat output in front of real people \nif i could dig into the details a little \nbit about how you explore that do you \nare using gbg3 as an inference api are \nyou exploring say supervised learning \nand uh maybe i don't want to ask a \nquestion that has too many things \npackaged into it so maybe let me just do \nit whenever \nwe're using the the public api uh so as \ni guess it's a fundamentally um \nwith like kind of the \nwith whatever prompts um that they that \nthey supply with like kind of the \nconfigurations for like temperature and \nwhatnot and then um it's \nit's the in context learning setting \nfine-tuned setting \nso could you tell me how you adapt that \nfor extractive question answering is it \nyou give it it's like kind of the t5 \nstyle where it you first tell it like um \nquestion answering the answer is going \nto be in this passage like some prompt \nthat describes the task and then it has \nthe context and then the question and \nthen it \ngenerates it right and you have to map \nthe generated thing \nuh like you do like exact match with the \ntext similarity of the generated thing \nwith \nthe ground truth answer is that the \nexact setup yeah that's right or \nvariations of that we may or may not \ninclude like the \nthe the instructions for the um for the \ntask itself or it could just be like \nthree examples five examples of like \nhere's the thing here's a question \nhere's the context here's the here's the \nanswer as a string and then again like \nyou said the exact match for evaluation \nor some per perturbation of like the \nordering of these things you you kind of \nhave to mess with gpd3 \num prompt form uh quite a bit to get it \nto work reasonably \nand i think this is a great transition \ninto our next topic where i want to talk \nto you about the different uh tasks in \ndeep learning and \ni remember i think you were one of the \nfirst authors that really or and your \nteam of course that developed this uh \ntldr abstractive summarization and to me \nit's just such a remarkably high output \nspace that you have to have like \ncompared to classification where you say \nhave two labels and it's just one \nprediction of two labels whereas text \ngeneration you have say 50 000 potential \ntokens and then you also like unroll \nthat into like \n50 or so you generate like a long \nsummary uh what are your thoughts on \nthat kind of difference in output space \ni mean it's a pretty big question but \nyeah yeah um so tldrs um was a project \nwith isabel cachola who's at jsu right \nnow as a phd student um and with uh \narmand gohan my co-worker um \nand \nuh that was an interesting one because \nwe actually did go into the project \nthinking \num \nwow this is like an impossible task um \nthis is actually like super difficult \nbecause of this it's so the output space \nis like 30 tokens and we gotta compress \nan entire paper like a gist of entire \npaper into like 30-ish tokens um \npeople can do this our people have been \nable to do this sensibly because you can \nsee on like open review which is the \ndata set we used um authors are actually \nwriting they don't teal the ads for \ntheir papers for other \nreviewers to read so \nat least it's not like \nhumans aren't stuck at going like what \nshould i put down that at least there is \nsome answer that the authors will write \nthat and we \nbut trying to replicate that with the \nmodel seems \nseemed like really daunting \num \nbecause of this word that like what it \ncould be anything like you could just \nput anything into the art and like how \nwould you know um but surprisingly as we \nwere studying more and more uh \nthe teal there's the authors tended to \nwrite um \ni'm actually \nmore and more optimistic about this task \nbeing actually simpler than it um than \nwe originally thought um yes \nit is the output spaces it is like a \nthird compress a giant document into 30 \ntokens yes it is generated text so you \ncan just say anything \nbut in terms of like \ngenerating if the goal is to generate \nsome \ntldr \nthat is \nenough information \nto for a user for like a reader who's \nlike kind of scrolling through like a \nsearch page if you're like google \nscholar or something going through a \nsearch page \nor going through conference proceedings \nor just looking at some author's profile \nand looking at a bunch of lists of \npapers um \njust enough information that helps \npeople make a decision as to whether \nlike a more informed decision as to \nwhether they should invest \nlike look into this paper or not \num \nthe the \nyes there are multiple right answers \nbut \nyou can really easily find \nreasonable sensible right answers from \nthe paper itself and just kind of clean \nthem up \ni think this is a function of just how \npapers are written \nif you look in the introduction if you \nlook in the conclusion \num even if you kind of search around \nlike topic sentences in the um \nin a within within the paper authors \ntend to write in a manner that is \nvery much like \noh they skipped over the rest of my \npaper but if i had to give them one \nsentence to like so that they had a \ntakeaway um i'll at least put like like \na main sentence in the conclusion and so \nthe task really becomes kind of this \neven if this is kind of what the book \npart is fundamentally doing um it kind \nof becomes \ncan you find like a reasonable input \ncontext that probably contains these \npromising sentences that are already \nvery tldr like or summary like \nput those in front of a model and then \njust the model just really needs to kind \nof shorten it \nmove things around to kind of get it to \nbe short pithy easy to understand \nself-contained \nand that type of operation is really \nsuitable for for for kind of these like \nlarge models that we have today \nyeah it's super interesting that it \nseemed like the large models seem to be \nable to uh like decompose the task like \nthat \nand i'm i'm so curious your thoughts on \nthis because i it seems like you've done \nsuch an exhaustive coverage of text \nclassification like natural language \ninference fact verification question \nanswering summarization so i'm i'm \ncurious and then kind of with what \nyou're saying is um you could probably \njust classify like three salient \nsentences in a paper to do an extractive \nsummary right and and wouldn't that be \nmuch easier to like label and kind of \nunderstand it \nthan \nyeah yeah so so this actually stumbles \nonto a project that i'm working on uh \nwith um uh uh lucas oldangmi who joined \nour team recently um \nwhich is like trying to identify salient \nsentences and papers so there's no we \ndon't have any work out there right now \nthis is actually like pretty like i \nthink we are like a couple months into \nit um \nuh it is really \nit is really hard uh to find \nsalient sentences uh once \num \nif you i guess like there's like these \nkind it's almost like there's like the \nstep function for like if you're if \nyou're if your criteria is i want to \nfind like one or two or three sentences \nmax \nthat really get at the core of a paper \num and helps a person make a decision as \nto what whether to click this paper \num that's pretty easy um \npapers are written this is kind of like \nwhat i was saying the papers are written \nsort of with these paper with these with \nthese kind of summary like sentences \nspeckled throughout so you can look like \na lot of papers just have contribution \nsections where they just literally pull \nit out like we did this we did this with \nthis and these are the three things that \nyou should care about if you don't care \nabout anything else in this paper um and \nso if your goal is to up like a tldr and \njust want to capture that type of stuff \nthen the task really is find those \nsentences synthesize them into something \nthat's kind of legible \nonce you start going a little bit beyond \nthat into going okay well i want \nsomething that's a little bit more like \nan abstract or i want something that's a \nlittle bit more just like uh maybe i \nwant like a block like generate a blog \npost \nabout like to summarize this paper \nso something that's like cuts the paper \ndown in linked by half but not you know \nall the way down to like a tlr that's \nwhen it gets extremely subjective \nbecause we recently did like a a study \num where we had like 12 people on the \nsame team \nuh annotate the same paper and this is \none of our own papers so we were all \nextremely familiar with it um \nand just had everyone just kind of read \nthrough and select like if you had to \npick like thirty percent of paper \nto highlight that was like salient what \nwould you pick and it was like aside \nfrom those few sentences or those few \npassages which would uh be prime \npassages for input to a tldr model \neverything else was just like hyper low \nagreement like nobody could agree that \nwhether some of the math stuff was \nimportant so nobody agreed like oh this \nis actually a super important detail \nbecause if you knew this field then like \nthis is actually like make or break for \nthis paper like and like um \nso yeah i think that's kind of how i \nthink of this like teal the art is easy \nwhen you start getting to like generate \nan abstract maybe that's kind of \neasy-ish also i think it's less easy but \nit's easy-ish because there's just so \nmuch \ndata free data out there and then when \nyou start getting into like i want \nsomething that's a little bit longer \nthan abstract \num \nlike kind of like a blog post or \nsomething like that \nor like a kind of like a i don't know \njust like \neditorially type type documents for \nthese papers um \nuh that's when it gets just like \neveryone's gonna argue about what is \nactually truly salient so \nthere are so many questions i want to \nask to attack that i want to try to \nmaybe \nmaybe keep keep with one that i think \ncould be quick and then i want to ask \nyou about these kind of data annotation \nuh efforts which i think is extremely \ninteresting but um so this dense \nannotation where you take a a team of 12 \nnlp scientists and they each \nuh densely annotate a paper like write \nit write the comments right highlight \nwhy i like this \nand then do you think that the kind of \nidea of say semi-supervised label \npropagation where you try to \ndeploy that team for say a hundred \npapers and it would probably be an \nexpensive endeavor but and then trying \nto bootstrap that dense annotation to \nnovel papers \ndo you think that would work \nmaybe maybe \nit's hard for me to say just because \nlike \num i don't even understand the phenomena \nthat we're annotating yet like when what \nis sort of like the the function that \neveryone is employing when they when \nthey're like received with the task \nwould just annotate what you think is \nimportant and somehow they map like \nsalient or important to \ni don't know k different criteria that \neveryone sort of forms and then they \napply that annotation i don't know what \nthat is yet i don't know what what \nconstitutes an importance \num \ni don't know how to break down what \nimportant means to people yet so so i'm \nnot sure actually yeah \nyeah maybe like um \nlike a like user embeddings some kind of \nmodel of you know kyle and connor are \ngoing through the paper and you have \nsome kind of \nuh representation of kyle and conor's \nbackground knowledge to help you \ninterpret the annotation \nmaybe some kind of flavor of it like \nthat maybe so like if you're bringing up \nlike kind of like user embeddings or \nuser representations um you're getting \ninto this realm of like personalization \num and and i guess that's kind of what i \nwas saying is like i don't know if this \nuh if personalization is the right place \nto go now \num in general yes i like things to be \npersonalized \nto to people \nbut practically speaking if we had to \nlike start somewhere we want to start \nwith kind of what's the most effective \nuh kind of making progress on this task \nand \ni don't know what personalization is the \nis the thing like it could be kind of \nlike tldr's where \nuh if there is like a \nshared convention \nin it within a community where everyone \nkind of looks for contribution \nstatements everyone kind of looks for \nthese and then then it's not about um \npersonalizing to a person's preferences \nit's about understanding what the \nconventions are for how to read papers \nwithin this community and then just \nhighlighting those so like the biggest \nexample of this is like pico uh the pico \nframework within um \nuh medical papers like clinical clinical \ntrial papers this is like a convention \nthat people the uh you know um \nclinical researchers medical researchers \nwho read these papers have developed \nand refined over years and everyone \nagrees \nthat like \nplus minus some variation of different \nframeworks but like that like yeah for a \npaper if you really want to summarize \nreally quickly what this paper is about \nyou got to know what the p participants \nare \nyou got to know like where the \npopulation is you got to know what \ninnervation is intervention is you need \na competitor you need the outcome and \njust like if you can summarize this \nextract this information \nyou can go through papers really quickly \nor you can \ntoss them in database do some nlp to \nsummarize and aggregate and so \nunderstanding that convention uh \nis sort of key and i like building tools \ntaylor.com is really key for this \ncommunity but and i don't know what this \nwhat like a pico type thing would look \nlike for other disciplines yet or if \nit's like you can't there is no ego for \nfor for understanding what people think \nis import uh salient and therefore you \nshould invest more in like personal \nsection \ni i think that is just such an \nsuch a fascinating kind of thing the \npico analogy and that that's kind of \nwhat brings me back to the \none of the first questions i asked you \nabout is this idea of should we study \ndeep learning papers or say are any kind \nof scientific papers because i think \nlike with um deep learning experiments \nwe can kind of identify say the symbolic \ncomponents of what's not so like we \ncould say um you know it's the bert \nmodel architecture \nand uh the learning rate scheduler is \nconstant like we can construct the dag \nsort of of the dependencies and the \nexperiments and say like here is the the \nnormalization layers this is what was \nchanged \nand like we could maybe \nyeah like extract those kind of graphs \nfrom papers \nand maybe those kind of graphs could for \none it could quickly illustrate the \npaper like here is the paper like it's \nbert it's this data set is constant and \nthen here's the thing that was changed \nthe normalization layers this is kind of \nexample and maybe that would be one way \nto like communicate the papers \nyeah i so yeah what should we be \nstudying i guess like these papers \nor like this discipline of papers for \nothers i don't know um i i try not to \nhave like like i guess like like i guess \nat a high level like in kind of \ninstinctual level yes i think we should \nbe working on making medical research \nmore like easier to digest and follow um \nbecause that seems like it's like a \ngeneral good thing uh for people um for \nlike like aipay first like i don't know \nmaybe \nmaybe um \nit's hard to justify that that that that \nworking on our papers is more important \nthan working on like helping like a \ndoctor read \nfollow follow the latest clinical trials \num but \ni think um it depends on kind of what \nyour goal is the way i try to \ndo research and what i sort of um \nrecommend to my mentees is like \ntry to be deliberate in your choice of \nwhich discipline to to to a papers to \nstudy just because any project within \nour space is takes a really long time \nannotation takes a long time you got to \nhire experts and so \ni would say do \nthe thing that actually actually allows \nyou to like completely \ncompletely finish the study on the \nphenomena you're interested in so \nfor example \num if you want to build something useful \nbroadly useful and that's it and you're \nlike interested in just trying to \nunderstand how can we use these nlp \ntools to build something that's useful \num \npick and you have a medical collaborator \ngo with that if you have if you don't \nhave a medical collaborator um then i \nwould hesitate to say that you should \nbuild something for medical uh for the \nmedical population because \nif the goal is to build something useful \nand you don't have someone from that \npopulation to work with like how do you \never really know um you \ni would say in that case build something \nfor yourself because at least you are \nyou know what would be useful for \nyourself and that and i think that can \nhelp people keep focused if you're \ninterested in studying \nparticular language phenomena then you \nshould like that you think are \ninteresting uh for example math and like \nsymbols and stuff uh in math papers um \ndefinitely \njust pick the papers that have as many \nmuch of that phenomena as possible and \nstudy that um \nso \nyeah i guess it depends on kind of what \nyou're trying to get out of what what's \ninteresting and what you're trying to \nget out of out of out of this work um \nso um yeah \ni think my thesis on this is maybe \nlike maybe two grandiose sort of it kind \nof \nlike um i guess kind of my motivation \nfor this is i think this is something \nthat dennis has said when they ask him \nuh you know why ai and he kind of says \nwell intelligence is the thing that \nsolves all the problems so if you can \nsolve ai you solve all the problems kind \nof in that sense that it's kind of like \nand i and i definitely think that yeah \nthinking that like you can just build a \nsuper ai that becomes a doctor just like \nyou know without any kind of human input \ni obviously understand that you would \nneed that kind of connection to make \nthat uh leap but i guess the kind of \nthing about it that has really captured \nmy interest is say openai's codex and \nthe ability of language models to \nwrite the code so they so with the \nability to also write the papers digest \nthe papers and then also kind of like \nwrite the pie torch code and then you \ncould kind of completely encapsulate \nthem in that environment with the \ndatasets that were because we're like \njust kind of trying to figure out how to \nincrease like the squad benchmark \nimagenet benchmark right so so it's like \ncompletely encapsulated in that \nenvironment which you say would be a \nuseful generalization sort of \nlike the idea that it could \nwrite its own papers oh \npapers um there's actually some i think \nuh there's some interesting work from \nuh kevin knight's group uh usc i think \nkanji \ngroup at uiuc who do like \nautomatic paper writing i think \nsomething called paper robot from usc \nand then there's like hangi's group does \nlike automatic review writing \num \ni i would say that those \nlike i'm i'm actually a huge fan of \nthose works um i don't view them i'm not \na fan because i like i think that should \nexist that we like need systems that \nwill write papers for us um but i do \nthink like \nfrom a research perspective from like uh \nwhat can we get out of understanding \nwhether these these like are like modern \nai tools \ncan and can't accomplish when given \nthese sort of like kind of absurd tasks \ngenerate a paper \nuh i think just studying that helps us \nunderstand limitations of these tools \num and if and my takeaway from looking \nat those works is like \nokay what are things that these that we \ncan kind of reliably \ntrust these these models to to get right \nyou know autocomplete type stuff \nautocomplete for boilerplate right is \nthe thing that people love the most um \nfor for for \nlms that write code \nand so what is the kind of the \nequivalent of that for a paper um \nand then how can we build \ntools uh \naround just this functionality but \nallowing a human to seamlessly still \nkind of \ndo everything else i guess it depends on \nhow sci-fi you want to like your like \ntimeline is if you're like if you wanna \nif you if you don't mind your research \nbeing used like \nlike \nkind of super super far out then yes i \nthink you should totally you could \nprobably work on like let's just \ngenerate the paper and end and not worry \nabout the human component \nfor me i'm more of like a i'd like to \nsee stuff being used fairly recently and \nso uh \nfor me it's more about like \nokay what can we figure out can we \nunderstand these to what extent these \ntools are useful now or in the next few \nyears and then \npartner with like kind of experts um \nto build kind of these like synergistic \ntools uh \nyeah yeah i agree i think i i did get \nkind of carried away with the animation \nyeah i obviously love the human computer \ninteraction i'm not like trying to put \nmyself in us out of a job but with the \nidea of like just completely automate \nthe role of the scientist in the middle \nbut maybe we could um come down come \ndown from the clouds to can we automate \nscientific reviewing in that question of \ncan tldr abstract or summarization \nlike what kind of tools do you inv i \nknow obviously symantec scholar is like \na platform with all sorts of things can \nyou imagine like you upload your paper \nand then it you know all these tasks \nlike cytance classification where \nyou know the model analyzes one of your \ncitation sentences and then gives you \nsome feedback for your for for the human \nin the loop for the sake of here's how \nyou write a better paper \num that would be cool um i think i think \nanything in like the assistive writing \nuh space would be really interesting um \nour team has \nand i guess like my own interests also \nare definitely right now on the assist \nof reading \num just because \nreading papers is really hard um and it \nseems like there's some reasonable \npromise \num for nlp to \nactually help make papers make paper \nreading a lot easier um so \nand \ni also don't think that \num working on reading and working \nwriting \nare completely like disjoint paths for \nresearch like i do want some sort of \nassistive writing attack when i'm like \nwriting reviews when i'm um \nwriting papers \num when i'm writing like a tweet about a \npaper that \num \ni think that like the tools needed to to \nenable that type of assistive writing \ntechnology \nunder the hood probably has to uh is \nlike \nsort of doing some sort of like \ncomplicated reading comprehension term \nextraction definition uh uh like \ndefinition generation linking to \nto of these terms to like other papers \nlinking a freight claims to other papers \nlinking terms to wikipedia like these \ntypes of \nuh \noperations that you would kind of you \nwould \ndevelop if you're trying to build an \nassistive reading uh \nas well so you know you can imagine as \ni'm writing a review i am actually \nreading the paper and so whatever helped \nme write this thing \nthe pool probably helps me read it as \nwell \nand so hence right now the focus for us \nis like let's help people read and then \nmaybe once that's pretty much let's help \npeople let's add some more stuff and \nstart studying how to help people write \num \nbut yeah i think reading is like right \nnow just like the the number one thing \nit's um \ni think it should be super interesting \nfor nlp people who are tired of working \non like little short texts \nyou know titles and abstracts aren't \nsuper long um \nuh \nfull scientific documents are extremely \nrich with like really difficult \nphenomena and models fall over when \nyou're trying when you're trying to do \nanything on these papers um \nlike if you look at the performance of \nour best models on casper it's like \nawful um and casper is like uh can you \nanswer this basic question from the \nentire full paper \nthe papers have figures \ntables \num things are kind of out of order \nbecause like there's like layouts \nthat's part of part of part of um part \nof papers like there's like positioning \ninvolved of stuff there's sections and \nsubsections so things are organized \nhierarchically there's like \ninterruptions because of footnotes \nand so like \njust like papers are this really rich \nstructured document and the way we've \nbeen building these nlp models is sort \nof just assumes that we can just like \ntreat \nthese documents that one kind of giant \nstring uh without her structure and so \nonce you move applied techniques built \nunder this this this line of thinking on \nthese large papers \neverything kind of just doesn't work um \nand so that's \nlike i feel like that should be like \nextremely exciting to \npeople to work on um in addition to \num this is like prime time to to apply \nif you're interested in information \nattraction extract information from it \nfrom extract these terms extract \nrelations from papers and highlight them \nso that people when they're reading they \ncan actually see what's going on and \nthat's like a great application if \nyou're interested in information \ninstruction if you're interested in \nlinking \nto databases yeah like literally it's \nawful for me when i don't know a term at \nthe copy paste that term open a new tab \nand google and search and find the page \nand then jump back to paper \napply your anti-linking thing to just \nlike \nmaking that just like a one-click thing \nwithout having me leave the paper so \nlike there's like a lot of really useful \nopportunity to apply nlp \nuh nlp techniques that people have been \ndeveloping forever um to pay person to \nand then we make our own lives easier so \nthat's \na nice bonus \nyeah and i \nwell so firstly i i will i really do \nwant to return to the topic of getting \ntogether experts to annotate say \nknowledge intensive things like getting \ntogether 12 nlp scientists and i think \nwith q asparagus a team of at the \nuniversity of washington right and all \nthat and i really do want to get back to \nthat topic but quickly you touched on \nsomething that is just so important to \nwe v8 and our vector search community \nand as we've been partnering with gina \nai we've seen their doc array and how \nthey're organizing this idea of you have \na very complex object that you want to \nsearch through so you have to decomp you \nhave to segment it into different \nembeddings so as you mentioned like you \nwould want say an embedding for the \nabstract and embedding for you not even \nlike the whole introduction right \nbecause like two pages of introduction \nto uh \nfirst you gotta put it into like 512 \ntokens right and you can like average \nthe embeddings of the 512 tokens but and \nthen you have say images from the paper \nand then like the tables even kind of \nneed to be formatted differently like \nthe math for latex equations \nlike this kind of segmenting and i'm so \ncurious about like overall how you're \nsegmenting are you right now is the \napproach \nuh use something like lin form or like \nyou know the try to get the sparse \nattention so that you could maybe try to \nput the whole thing into one transformer \nor is it some kind of hierarchical \nuh you know segmentation and then \npropagation up however that might \nwork \nhonestly nothing quite works so um okay \nokay that's not true um uh i mean um \nfrom from the folks that uh from like is \nbeltagey and armand gohan matt peters uh \nyeah too um with long former um we've \nbeen using long-form for a lot of our \nexperiments and sort of the question is \ni think that you need like even though i \nthink that you need some new model \nuh \narchitecture that represents that can \nrepresent like this like \nthis like heavy amount of structure \nthat's in these papers \num \nthat's still a hypothesis like i could \nbe wrong about that \nand it could be that models are just so \npowerful \nthat today that you can just take the \ntext \nlinearize it in any arbitrary way just \nlike take it and turn it to one giant \nthing and then just apply \nand like maybe with like a few tricks \nlike add little set tokens between each \nsection or something and maybe that's \nlike the \nthat just like is just better results \nand better performance than any sort of \nfancy hierarchical language models like \narchitecture you could come up with i \ndon't i don't know um \ni think uh i think it's too early to \ntell because there's not enough tasks \nthat actually make use of \num there's not enough tasks and data \nsets on scientific papers uh at scale \nthat allow people to study this problem \nright like if you can't measure whether \nit's working either you you can't answer \nthe question \num there's just not enough people \nstudying the problem so you know i like \ni like having i would trust kind of i \nwould have more stronger opinion if i \nhad like \nyou know a dozen labs just like kind of \nsaying like this is the right way i'm \nlike okay yeah it seems like they've \nthey've been studying this um quite a \nbit \num \nand uh \nyeah i don't think there's just been \nenough experimentation um just just \nabout different ideas um like if one \nhierarchical model architecture it \ndoesn't doesn't work does that mean that \nlike it just doesn't work or like or is \nthere some some other thing um \nso there's just like too much work that \nstill needs to be done \nfor me to really have a strong opinion \nnested i i haven't i have a guess that \nit that something special needs to \nhappen especially with latex equations \nand figures and tables \num \nbut there's also like a an ink language \nlike \nmaybe it's just about vision language \nmodels maybe just like taking like \nscreenshots of of of tables and figures \nand then just like toss them into \nsomething \nand then do like a vlper type thing and \nthen that's it \num \nso so i don't know yet \nyeah seeing the demonstrations of \nflamingo on twitter deepmind's new tech \nimage uh captioning thing is definitely \nmade me think that that idea of the yeah \nlike screenshots the tables i'm it's \nlike you're pretty good \nyou're good i was like \nso this is one of those things like \ni invest a bunch of time trying to \ndevelop like custom architecture that i \nthink is tailored science documents work \nor is it really just about \nuh \nsmashing these things together \npre-training and then you know \nwhere to go \nyeah and um so i'm trying to think of if \nthis would be too off topic but maybe \nvery quickly \nlike as we've been studying approximate \nnearest neighbor search \nwe've kind of been thinking about \nwhether this could be the answer to very \nlong range attention like if you could \nuh \nyou know have the the query key \ndot product instead turns into an \napproximate nearest neighbor search with \nan enormous set of key like the keys are \nvectors right and you're so you match \nthe query \nlike quickly i'm sorry this is kind of \ndistracting from another topic \ndo you think that kind of \napproximate nearest neighbor search into \ntransformers could maybe be the solution \nto \nextremely large memory transformers or \nlike extremely large attention \ninputs \num \ni guess like a like a \na cheap a cheating answer would be like \nmaybe maybe \nwhat it means to be seen so so i guess \num \nwe uh we have some people \nuh \nkind of joining recently looking into \nlike we were interested for a while \nuntil like rich people augmented \nlanguage models which i guess kind of \nhas that idea right it's just like oh a \nlanguage model \nwe don't need a language model like this \nlike enormous language to memorize \neverything about about about text we \nshould be able to offload some stuff \nlike knowledge to some other components \nuh embed them somehow and then i guess \nlike retrieve um when it's needed um \nthis seems like a really appealing way \nof viewing the problem of like \nespecially in science new things are are \nare being discovered new terms are being \ninvented new ways of i guess like new \nfacts about the world \nare constantly being being generated and \nuh it is impractical to just kind of \nlike keep training well maybe it's \nimpractical to keep training just like \nlanguage models that kind of keep keep \nup to date with this thing so \nrepresenting it separately and then \nhaving a language mod that kind of like \nand i'll either dot products into these \nembeddings or or or somehow just \nretrieves passages and then learns how \nto encode those like text patches into \nembeddings on the fly and then \nincorporate them into the language model \nseem promising to me um \ni know there's like the kill benchmark \nwhich evaluates uh \nlike kind of like knowledge intensive \nmodels um and the retrieval augmented \nmodels are sort of doing the best on the \nbenchmark but uh \ndefinitely i guess still need to see \nmore of it for science um and i don't so \ni don't know \nit's like still \nright um this this line of \nwork \nyeah that's really interested in uh when \nmalt piece from haystack came on the \nebay podcast you mentioned that that \napproach of retrieval augmentation it \nallows for better interpretability \nbecause you kind of see what it's using \nto make its prediction it's better for \nupdating it \nand then i think uh i think it's better \nfor maybe removing the biases that kind \nof thing because of kind of entangled \ninterpretability i think maybe there was \na third thing he had mentioned that i'm \nforgetting now and i actually read a \nrecent paper uh the biomedical enhanced \nuh \nor biomedical evidence it's called like \nliterature augmented clinical outcome \nprediction oh i think that's from \nakangshan uh and tom hopeless wong from \nfrom our team probably yeah yeah yeah \nand it's that kind of thing where you \nretrieve from chord 19 right and it \nhelps you do the clinical narrative \ncompletion \nyeah that stuff is really cool yeah \nyeah that's so interesting and \nso sorry so let me come back to what we \nwere talking about about this idea of uh \ntaking in the whole paper as input \nreally quickly so it sounded like maybe \nyour issue with it would it would be \nhard to build the data sets maybe and \nand so i wanted to ask your opinion you \nmentioned open review earlier as a data \nsource and i've seen you using \ntechniques like this before \nuh so so do you think and that like i \nyou know people \nreview papers they compress the paper \ninto you know strong rejects \nexplanation \nor neutral like uh \nso do you think those data sets and from \nplatforms like open review \ndo you think that could be \na way to get that going and yeah yeah so \ni \num \ni'm like a pretty strong believer in \nderiving data sets from real platforms \nwhere humans are like actually using the \nplatform to do something sensible um as \nopposed to kind of like contriving a \ntask and then hiring people to do it um \nso open review i it i think is a great \nresource um \nfor for \nreal \nlive sort of like um what are they uh \nblinking over like like natural or \num it's fine but yeah you get the idea \nit's just like it just seems like it's a \nreally great \nplatform um \ni think my only concern with it is just \nit's just kind of \nnot big enough \nuh so you know more success to open \nreviews so we can get more data \nbut it's limited to particular fields of \nlike particular computing related fields \num so there's no like open review for \nbiomedical literature clinical \nliterature um so \nthat's kind of that's kind of the worry \nso i think it's a combination of like \ntrying to be opportunistic like finding \nthese like really useful data sets and \nalso investing in techniques that help \nyou like \nnot have to re build that open review \nfor a new discipline each time just like \nyou want some way to do an adaptation to \nthese other friends when there is no \ndata \nand \nthis kind of takes me to another \nquestion i want to ask you related to \nthe uh q asper work where i think it was \nyou you hire uh \ngraduate students at the university of \nwashington \nto uh yeah yeah \nso so i was wondering about like if you \nhad a platform that would you know pay \npeople directly to do this kind of \nexpert annotation \nwhat do you like i guess the question \ni'm i'm kind of asking you is \nlike with your papers would you be \nwilling to pay for such a review such an \nannotation of your own paper and then \nsome maybe \nyou know platform that ties into uh \ni like you also opt-in to let this be \nused as a data set such that the \nlanguage model could be trained on it to \nmaybe supplement you not to like put you \nout of a job as the annotator \nwhich i guess this kind of idea was \ndoing from the start right it's like if \nyou're yeah yeah \num \njust uh just so i can understand \nquestion are you suggesting that we \nshould be paying reviewers \nit's an interest i think it's an \ninteresting thing because it the \nincentive system now does seem a little \nbizarre to me \nbecause you're kind of reviewing it for \nlike you know the sake of \nyou know like scientific rigor which is \ngreat \nyou know which is great but if i feel \nlike if you added the payment i mean you \nmight get the bias towards like i want \nto write a good review because they've \npaid me for it or \nsomething along those kind of lines but \ni mean i'm curious what you generally \nthink of it it's not like a startup that \ni'm launching or anything \nno that's really that's interesting \n[Music] \ni \ni generally so maybe spicy take but like \ni definitely think um reviewers should \nbe compensated for their work because \nit's a lot of work it's a lot of \nexpertise work in the community and like \npublishing communities rely heavily on \nthis \num we're sort of relying on volunteer \neffort right now obviously there's some \nlike i guess like for academia we need \nto \nyou know \nmoney like this destroys the sanctity of \nit but i don't know we should pay people \nfor their labor so \num i definitely review like review or \nwork should be compensated i just don't \nknow if i don't i i'm not sure about \nwhether the author should be paying um \nthe reviewer exactly or \ncoming from yeah or like is it like \nthrough fees or something like that type \nof thing i think needs to be \nexperimented a little bit because of i \nguess i don't \ni'm not like crystal ball enough to like \nfigure out like what the ins how the \nincentives can align or don't align or \nsomething with in those types of \nscenarios \nyeah that's a pretty interesting detail \nbut should the authors be because i \nguess it's like for me as a phd student \nuh publishing papers it's like if i can \nget a paper into iclr \nit would be \nit would benefit my career from the rest \nof my life sort of so i i would be \nwilling to pay for this kind of review \nright and it's kind of like as you put \ntogether these teams \nthese reviews are kind of you know you \nknow i mean i don't know how like you \nknow obviously you communicate a lot \nwith your teams but the reviews are sort \nof the \ncommunication bottleneck \nat least with my ph in my experience \nwith my phd lab \nthe reviews is our kind of like \ninterface with each other mostly \nwith you mean with like other \nresearchers in the field \nyeah like at least at florida atlantic \nuniversity we have a little lab and we \ntrade we trade reviews that's how like \nthat's how we communicate we don't so \nlike and i imagine a lot of other labs \ndo interface that way \nso maybe \nyou know can it connects you to the \nbigger \nyou know market by having it be paid \nbecause then it's more like \nyou know more people would probably sign \nup to that and offer their expertise \nbecause because again it's it's like \nexpertise it's not like anyone could \ngive you a thorough review of your uh \nyeah yeah augmented language model \nyeah yeah i um \n[Music] \nit's interesting \nit's interesting i don't know um i but \ni'd be interested in seeing \nwork in this space \num maybe some like kind of like \nlongitudinal studies that in in \nyeah and maybe it comes back to like \ncode reviews too like the same idea but \nfor reviewing your code your commits is \nlike this idea of \nkind of like science and also code and \nmaybe even coming way back into when i \nmentioned kind of codex and why i see \nlike the code \nthe the language models that write code \ni think and the language models that \ninterpret science i think should come \ntogether a little more \ni can see that i can see i can see that \nhappening for \num \ni think for select things i think for i \nthink i can i can see it happening for \num okay so like definitely for for a \nfairly low level writing clarity type \nthings \num you know i would love it if if \nsomething uh could tell me if like i \nhave a variable that's unassigned which \nis very much like a kind of code thing \nbut when i'm like typing up notation and \ni'm like come coming up with notation \nand overleaf um if i just have like \nlike a subscript eye that is literally \nnever used i want someone to tell me \nthat that's the case and that's fairly \nlow level it's just like checking like \nthis thing isn't it used anywhere else \num \nand then maybe i would i would like \nsomething which is like oh hey you're \nmissing the citation \num in as you're writing and i thought oh \nyeah that'd be good just like prompt it \nso then i can figure out what to do with \nit um so there's like a lot of like \nlittle things that i have to keep in my \nhead and i just like don't want to keep \nthem in my head and it would be nice if \nsome agent could like help remind me of \nthese things and then as it starts \ngetting into the territory of like \nit helps me interpret my results like \nthat's when i'm just like i don't know \ni don't know if i enjoy this um yeah i \nalso don't think that code like code \nlike the the code \nlanguage model stuff is like even at \nthat space either like nobody's like i \ndon't think they're creatively writing \nlike just like the idea of the software \nfor people \nright \nyeah and so that's that's the other \nthing he said that's what i currently \nuse uh literature mining tools for is to \nyou know i have an idea is this actually \na novel idea hit the literature or try \nto find the idea of the paper \nis that currently how you mostly use the \ntools can you tell me about like how you \nuse semantic scholar and how that you \nknow because again like you have this \nmeta thing where you're developing the \ntools you have anything yeah it's a nice \nspace to be in yeah i do have the same \nthing i i use um i actually use a \ncombination of stuff because it's like \nmissing something is catastrophic um so \ni don't trust any one tool i use mascara \ngoogle scholar \num \nand i use i use a lot of social signals \ni think i use a lot i just use a lot of \njust like everyday check archive \njust skim the the next batch of like 20 \nor so papers for that day it's like \nthere's a lot of like you never know \nwhen one tool is going to miss something \nand i also just ask people constantly \njust like have you seen anything like \nthis you've seen them like this um i do \na lot of really manual traversal of \ncitations um \nso \nuh \nit's all terrible it's all awful work um \nand we definitely need more things that \nmake it make it um nicer because it \nreally is like no one tool is is is \nkind of \nthe thing \nat the moment \nyeah salute to you for uh checking \narchive directly i have to get it dumbed \ndown through the twitter bottleneck \nbut yeah that's that's really \ninteresting and maybe like a concluding \nquestion on the podcast that i ask a lot \nof people and again i you're uniquely \npositioned to answer this is what is \nyour information dot i mean you kind of \ndid just answer the question but is \nthere anything lacking from that of your \nkind of information diet \nfor my information diet \num \nwow that's the thing so the thing with \nlacking is like \nprobably but i don't know what it is \ni think that's the problem that's the \nproblem with this information diet thing \nright so \num i actually don't know if there's \nsomething lacking but there probably is \nuh \nand um \nmy information diet today is just like i \ncheck archive \num almost every day i actually use this \nman scholar recommendation feed um which \nis quite good \num \nit's quite i mostly read papers that \nlike teammates um and like friends \npeople i follow will share on twitter \nshare in slack messages and stuff like \nthat um and i actually i think like half \nthe papers i read these days are are for \nlike peer review \ni like peer view duties i actually \nreally enjoy reviewing um because you \nget to see like what people are \nsubmitting \num you get to see like like that's kind \nof like the glimpse into like what's \nhappening right now that's not \nin the public and \num \nit helps you read in a different way \nthan if you're just kind of passively \nconsuming what's on twitter they help \nlike it keeps like kind of like the the \ncritique \nengine sharp um \nuh \nyeah i guess that's probably most of my \ndiet but \nif i had to pitch an idea for somebody \nto go work on something i would love \nsomebody to \nbuild like a browser extension that \ntracks the stuff that i'm reading \nyou know doesn't like do something weird \nwith my data but like attractive stuff \ni'm reading summarizes it to me and \nmaybe recommends me like papers that or \nlike avenues for accessing papers that \nlike \ni should be accessing but like i don't i \ndon't even know exist i guess this is \nlike i don't know what i'm missing in my \ndiet so i want someone to tell me that \ni'm not eating enough protein or \nsomething \nyeah \nand maybe \nuh if it's not too much of a personal \nquestion could you maybe take me into \nlike a day in your life at the allen \ninstitute i'm like very curious what \nthat entails \nyeah so day in life um i think for me uh \nnowadays it's like \ni \nam in meetings with uh i guess like \nwe're kind of entering this like summer \nuh spring summer and then kind of \nthrough fall so this half of the year \nit's mostly mentoring uh \ninterns uh who are like kind of like \ncurrent phd students \num \nor \nundergrads who are kind of preparing for \num their phd applications or to enter a \nphd program so it's a lot of mentoring \nuh people like kind of new people who \nare showing up for this half a year uh \nwe're starting on new projects doing a \nlot of ideation a lot of just like \nsitting in a room and just like talking \nabout like should we do this or do this \nuh run some quick experiments meet back \nagain \nas i get stuck and try to interpret the \nresults try and decide like should we \ninvest more in this direction should we \npivot it's a lot of these kind of \nuh really quick turnaround decisions \nabout how um \nuh how to like go about answering \nquestions that we're interested in um \nand then \nthat progresses into more heavy duty \ndevelopment work um over time where it's \nlike every day is just like kind of \nwriting code running experiments \nchecking those experiments and then \nrevising or fixing some bug or something \nand then into like writing and \nsubmission or just like every day just \nlike writing reviewing the papers \nchatting with people um \nand and continuing revising um \nso \ndepending on the stage i'm in it's like \nall of it is chatting with people all of \nit is like developing or all of it it's \njust like writing \nsuper interesting well kyle thank you so \nmuch for coming on the podcast and i i \nreally really enjoyed this conversation \ni love these topics and i think \nscientific literature mining and the \nwork you're doing is just \ndefinitely my one of my favorite things \nto keep up with in deep learning and \nit seems like it's headed to such a such \nan exciting application being realized \nwith deep learning cool thank you so \nmuch for inviting \n[Music] \nyou \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Kyle Lo on Scientific Literature Mining - Weaviate Podcast #17", "path": "", "link":
