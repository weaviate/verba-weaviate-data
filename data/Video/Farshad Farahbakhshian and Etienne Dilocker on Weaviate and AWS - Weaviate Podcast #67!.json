{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the 67th Weaviate Podcast, announcing Weaviate on the AWS Marketplace! \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching the weba podcast I am \nincredibly honored and grateful to host \nthese guests on the podcast this topic \nwill be absolutely epic firstly we \nwelcome back we VA Chief technology \nofficer and co-founder Eddie and \ndillocker Eddie and thank you so much \nfor joining the podcast again thanks for \nhaving me and of course I am beyond \nexcited to welcome farshad farabakshian \na principal Solutions architect at \nAmazon web services farshad thank you so \nmuch for joining the podcast hey thank \nyou so much and by the way my My Title \nHere is actually gen AI specialist but a \nlot of times people think I'm a \nSolutions architect so it's all good \nnice to meet you all \nso could we uh kick it off with like um \nI think maybe you know some for our \nnewer listeners could we maybe even \nstart from the beginning Eddie and if \nyou could kind of just you know what is \nweeviate even just kind of like you know \nalleviating the evolution of it that's \nled us to this point of you know talking \nabout with AWS about running it on the \ncloud and kind of how far the journey \nhas come \ngotcha yeah sure let me try to keep this \nbrief because I don't fill the entire \npodcast with this and and hopefully as I \nsaw on the the self-hosting part we can \ndefinitely dive deeper into that later \nin the security privacy Etc as box uh \nbut basically vb8 is a vector database \nor for those of you who don't know what \nthat is it's essentially the long-term \nmemory for for a large language model so \nfor retrieve login to generation for \nexample definitely something that we're \ngoing to dive into I guess uh and bv8 is \nan open source Vector database you can \nuse vv8 as a SAS offering from from us \nso that's our BB account service but you \ndon't have to if you don't want to if \nyou don't want to give your data away \nyou can self-host it or you can help us \nhelp you host it in your environment in \nyour Cloud tenant in your VPC that's one \nof the USPS of vb8 because that allows \nyou to to stay in control over all of \nyour data and then if you have that you \ncan query bb8 with Vector search so \ndense embeddings use dens embeddings for \nfor um for the modern day retrieval you \ncan do the classic stuff so bm25 you can \nmix it with hybrid you get all kinds of \nother database operations and all that \nat Great scale and uh yeah that was that \nwas my elevator pitch yeah I think \nthat's awesome I think just you know \nthis core of this hsw Vector index doing \nyou know fast nearest neighbor search is \nyou know and then especially with this \nretrieval augmented generation I think \nthis has caused just a boom and you know \nthe explosion of how often people are \nusing these kind of things so uh farshad \ncan you maybe tell us about kind of you \nknow how you see the state of vector \ndatabases and retrieval augmented \ngeneration \nyeah I mean at a high level most \ncustomers that I talk to they're like oh \nwe just want to fine tune everything \nright and you know fine-tuning is great \nit's it's how you \nteach your model new skills but it's not \nnecessarily the best way to have it no \nknowledge \num and so Vector databases is the most \nreliable way to do that and so \none of the most common use cases that we \nsee is hey uh here's a really simple one \nright like we want our customer service \nagents to be way more efficient right \nand we want them to very quickly go \nthrough a very relatively large \nknowledge base and retrieve precise \ninformation there's honestly not much \nreason to do fine tuning there unless \nyou want your language model to sound \ndifferent in how it interfaces with \nthose customers but if you want to \nretrieve specific info like something in \na data sheet Vector databases are very \npowerful that so pretty common \narchitecture that we see come up as a \nstrong llm plus that could be eight \nVector database combined to offer that \nsolution \nyeah it's amazing the chat Bots thing \nlike the whole like chat with your \ndocuments you know chat with your \nspecific customer tickets I think is \njust you know an incredible evangelist \nfor all this and yes I think we've kind \nof set the stage of what the technology \nis you know we V8 Vector database helps \nyou retrieve relevant information to put \nin the context of llms let's get into \nthe Super exciting topic that you know \nwe have our \nspecial guests the technical experts on \nyou know what does it take to run this \nin the cloud \nso a couple things right \nthere's so many ways of doing this in \nthe cloud right now right so I'm gonna \ngo top to bottom right \num and let's kind of view it as \nI view the LM as kind of like the center \nthat everything goes around \num if you want to work backwards from a \nproprietary proprietary llm like say \nfrom like an anthropic \num uh or a cohere \num \nyou generally are limited to however the \ncloud provider lets you access that in \nthe case of Amazon we have a service \ncalled bedrock what Bedrock is is an API \nservice that lets you do prompting and \ndepending on the model provider actually \nfine-tuning as well right so you have \nyour API portion of that what's \ninteresting about Bedrock is that we \nnever share the data or the prompting to \nthe model providers so what's kind of \ninteresting is that even though the \nmodel providers say that they will never \nuse the data our customers are like yeah \nbut we still want someone in between \nright so that's why Bedrock is one of \nthe value propositions right so you have \nyour API call goes to \num the the model hosted on AWS but you \ncan't access the weights it's all opaque \nand then around that is when you have to \nstart thinking about like well what I \nwant to do on top of that right but in \nparallel to that whole thing is you have \nopen source models \nllama 2 just came out right I think it \nwas last week kilometer two is doing \nreally well right and it's also open \nsource with something like llama two you \ncan use services like Bedrock \num but you can also use services like \nAmazon sagemaker jumpstart which the \ndifference between sagemaker jumpstart \nand Bedrock is that it's not serverless \nusers have to actually manage \ninfrastructure as well \num but some people like that some people \nlike having more knobs to control \num you can also fine-tune llama2 right \nso now once you start getting to some of \nthese models that fine tuning is a part \nof it some people like to have data \nengines that they incorporate RL HF into \nit \nright so \nhere's a really simple example a lot of \nfolks that build diffusion models the \nway they uh get human feedback is \nthey'll give you like four low \nresolution models and then they pick the \nuser picks they wanted to make want to \nmake high resolution \nand then now the model provider knows \nwhich one we've got the RL HF right \num so then you have a data engine \ninvolved right and then this is all \nusing managed Services we also have a \nton of customers that want to pre-train \ntheir own models uh a lot of folks tend \nto actually do this on bare metal ec2 \nright so we'll get your a100 to look at \nyour h100s we have our own proprietary \nchips called traniums as well uh which \nsupport things like llms and diffusion \nmodels and they'll basically take like \nno joke like \nup to like 4 000 gpus in one cluster to \ntrain one large job right so they get \nhuge \nso there's so many different ways to do \nit and we're not even going to the \ninference side of it but this is kind of \nlike the model piece of it right and \nthen depending on how you're going to be \nusing that model you're going to be \ninterfacing with a vector database like \nlike from leviate and you're obviously \ngoing to be using services like S3 to \nstore your data Maybe maybe you have a \ndata Lake involved as well \num the interesting thing that is a \nlittle bit different on training versus \ninference is that \nwhen you're doing training all you \nreally care about is like your time to \ntrain right it's just like train the \nmodel as fast as possible uh when it \ncomes to inference all of a sudden you \ncare about how everything plays with \neach other right it's like how tight \ndoes your vectorated database interface \nwith your llm how tight does that \neventually lead to your user experience \nright and that's probably it's going to \nbe dependent on use case right so like \nfor example if you have a live customer \nagent that's having real-time \nconversations with customers you're \ngoing to really care about latency at \nthat point right but if something is \nlike oh we have a week to get this \nresponse it's a complete completely \ndifferent architecture so now you start \ngetting into use case dependent \narchitectures that decide whether or not \nthings are going to be good and then \nonce you start really camera latency \nmodel distillation becomes important as \nwell right you want to get the model to \nbe as small as possible some people want \nto get these models to work on the edge \num you know I I can think of companies \ntrying to build you know uh metaverse I \nmean whatever whatever you want to call \nit where latency becomes so important \nwhere I can see a world where you're \ngoing to have custom ml chips for \ninference to host these models locally \nto just super reduce that latency for \nthose use cases but anyway I just talked \na lot so I'll let you ask me any \nquestions about that but I just wanted \nto give you like an overview of like \nwhat is this whole ecosystem look like \nfrom an infrastructure perspective \nyeah I'd say quickly with yeah I mean \nfirst I thought it was a really great \noverview I loved hearing all I mean I I \nthink I first heard about like sagemaker \nwith some of the stuff that hugging face \nwas doing like kind of for me person \nlike you know coming out of my PhD in \nmachine learning and starting to like \nlearn about what the products are and \nhow this really works in the real world \nand yeah hearing I mean the Bedrock API \njust so many interesting topics I think \num yeah maybe it would be great to kind \nof just talk about that integration \nbetween llms and Vector databases a \nlittle more you know just like um maybe \nEddie you could explain kind of how we \ndesign our generative modules and sort \nof how we think about that kind of thing \nyeah yeah specifically I want to want to \nstart with something on that part you \nmentioned the training objective of \ntraining this potentially as fast as it \nas you can train it and I assume that \nthe cycles in which you would retrain \nthey're relatively slow right or \nrelatively long Cycles so I'm curious \nsort of how does the the ability to \nchange your retrieval algor or industry \nalgorithm for your retrieval system on \nthe Fly Like does that sort of be before \nif you wouldn't do retrieval augmented \ngeneration and you would potentially \nhave to retrain your model every time it \nhas to get new knowledge in so how do \nthese sort of how do these Cycles differ \nand and uh when do I use what basically \nyeah that's a super cool way to \ncategorize it right because what we're \nstarting to get into is like now we want \nto have \na categorization and intuition for what \ndo you want to train for and what do you \nwant to use a knowledge base for \num \nI wasn't a call of anthropic last week \nand I really like the way they think \nabout it they split it into skill versus \nknowledge right so if you start to think \nabout like \nwhat is a skill versus knowledge right \nlet's let's use the lawyer example a \nskill that a lawyer has is understanding \nthe law the knowledge that they have is \nrecalling different laws right so you're \ndefinitely going to have use cases where \nyou want to build your model such that \nit builds an intuition for what it's \ndoing but you don't want to train it to \nunderstand every single law out there \nit's pretty inefficient to do that and \nit's probably not reliable right so \nif you feel that and if you if you \ncategorize it into those two different \nbuckets \nmy \nmy thought process my intuition tells me \nthat you can do way less training right \nbecause if you try to use training to be \nhave something be knowledgeable \nI mean you're all you can do is like \napproach what you can do with the vector \ndatabase even then you could never be \nfully as reliable as a vector database \nright so I would say if you're building \nan llm \num categorize it into those two things \nonce you feel that your Alum has the \nright skill base to sound \nlike what it needs to sound like whether \nthat's a customer service agent or \nlawyer or programmer \num or uh you know a musician whatever \nthat may be then it's time to start \nfocusing on the vector database and I'm \nwilling to bet it's like a 90 10 ratio \ndifference right if you start to start \nusing knowledge for Vector databases you \ncould probably do way less training that \nyou thought you need to \nleftist differentiation skill versus \nversus knowledge this is great so I'm \nthinking in my head when you brought up \nthe lawyer I'm thinking that the lawyer \nsitting in front of this shelf of books \nand the lawyer doesn't have to memorize \nevery single book they don't have to \nlearn it by heart because they can they \ncan just look it up and essentially \nthat's the retrieval part in in this \nthis awesome yeah and I I really love \njust like the separation I think like \nkind of like operationally like if you \nneed to keep fine-tuning the llm this is \nkind of one of the first things that \nDrew me to retrieve augmented generation \nis you know if every time you have new \nknowledge you need to retrain the model \nand then rebuild the apis and all that \nkind of stuff compared to this thing \nwhere you know the vector database is \neasier to update kind of like well how \ndo you think about that kind of aspect \nof it of how just the retrieval \naugmented setup you know it lets you \nupdate it just with way less overhead \nthan kind of maybe a more traditional \nmlops thinking of like keep training \nkeep training yeah I mean I would even \ntake it a step further I would be \nwilling to bet that for a lot of use \ncases if you use a vector data base and \nyou take advantage of a relatively large \ncontacts window you may never even have \nto do any fine tuning at all \nright so the vector database is going to \neat up a lot of the fine-tuning that you \ntraditionally think you would have to do \nin the past \num and we're seeing these models have \nvery large context Windows right like \ntoday \nanthropics context window is a hundred \nthousand tokens which means you could \ninput an entire Harry Potter book as \nyour prompt \nright so that in combination with the \nvector database \nI start wondering well you're probably \nyou're still going to need folks that do \nfine tuning \nright \nskills limited things Etc \num but I think you're going to be \nsurprised how much you can get away with \nwith a vector database plus some good \nprompting \nokay \nthat kind of brings us the opportunity \nto put that uh that training effort \npotentially into the vector database \nbecause the vector database also uses a \nretrieval model that commonly like like \nwith the um the latest models from \ncohere and open Ai and all these these \nmodels I think \nso if this has been put in in the shade \na bit like people don't talk about \nfine-tuning it as much anymore because \nthey become sort of more general purpose \nEtc \num but before that I think that was also \na very very common topic about \nfine-tuning those those models and I'm \nthinking \nif you have that that skill set in your \nteam to to train a model like \npotentially put that Focus instead of \nputting it on the the large language \nmodel just put it on the embedding model \nand and potentially get better domains \nfor your uh domain there \nyeah like the um you know the search \nrelevance improving the search all the \nknobs you can turn is so fascinating one \nthing I really love farshad is you bring \nup that like long context Windows is \nthis idea of like searching across \nmultiple information sources like you \nknow you're you have the You're Building \nlike a customer support chat bot and so \nit might search through one index of \nlike previous you know customer support \nthreads as well as searching through say \nthe weba blog posts or maybe the you \nknow the code base if needed but like \ncombining all these different \ninformation sources they call that like \nFederated search and yeah I think just \nthis idea of how you combine uh maybe \nlike multiple indexes together for \nretrieval augmented generation I think \nthat's one of the like emerging \nfrontiers of just you know packing that \nprompt with as much information as \npossible to complete the task \nyeah no I think uh you're right I just \nactually learned about this recently I \nsaw some like you know block diagrams of \nhow this is done on the llm side \num the llms uh look like donut \ntrajectory to know which database to go \nto to do different things right so \nthey're gonna like have an understanding \nof the question and then have like a \nprobability of what each database is \nlikely to answer this question and then \ngo to that database right which uh is \ninteresting because I think that's \nactually a little bit different \narchitecture than before right \npreviously a lot of folks would like \njust go directly to the data and then \ngive that to the LM to generate an \nanswer but now it's kind of the opposite \nnow you have an llm accepting the prompt \nunderstanding it deciding which database \nwhich Vector database for example to go \nto and then joining in response right so \nthat's really cool like we're starting \nto enter like oh this thing feels very \nintelligent right so I really like that \num and I think in general \nI the analogies that I like to think \nabout that we're going to eventually go \ntowards is like the human brain where I \nhave different parts of my brain to do \ndifferent tasks right there's a part of \nmy brain that does math which is \nprobably not the part of my brain that \nfuels emotions and that's probably not \nthe part of my brain that recalls \ninformation right and so what you start \nto look like is you you're gonna \nprobably want like something that has \nlogic to know what part of the brain to \ngo to or which which LM to go to and \nthen this example we're talking about \nfeels like it starts to approach that \nbecause while it's not different llms \nthat it's going to it's different \nknowledge parts of What's called the \nbrain or the you know whatever and it \nstarts to go to but if you can have \nsomething know where to go for different \ntypes of questions there's nothing \npreventing us from doing the same thing \nwith L alums in the long term right hey \nthis is a math question go to the math \nelement the reason why that's important \nis because \nyour brain would have to be so big if it \ndidn't have efficient smaller parts \nyou're going to do things and to make \nthat analogy with llms it's like we can \ncreate much more efficient models over \ntime and it create real products right \nthere's going to be limitations of cost \nand compute for specific use cases \nunless we get these distilled smaller \nmodels to do very specific tasks right \nso I think it's really exciting to hear \nabout this new architecture type \nthis this reminds me a bit of that \nquestion of whether a hybrid surge is \npotentially zero shot or or few shot \nbecause in in hybrid surgeon in our case \nwe have one parameter that can be tuned \nand that's essentially this Alpha \nparameter that tells you give more \nweight to either the embedding based \nsearch or give more weight to the the uh \na keyword based search and if the the \nmodel has some reasoning like \npotentially it could narrow this down \nalready it could say like hey this looks \nlike a brand name I'm probably going to \nwant more of a of a keyword match or \nsomething or just like like a product \ndescription or something so this could \nbe a move in that direction as well to \nto sort of give the model as you say \nmore intelligence more more domain \nknowledge about the back ends to just \nuse them better and and do better \nretrieval from them yeah super exciting \nyeah that's brilliant Eddie and I love \nthat like um you know the llm that knows \nhow to search you know friends I've been \ntalking to know that I don't shut up \nthese days about the gorilla large \nlanguage models which are like you know \nyou've instead of using a 200 billion \nparameter gbt4 model or whatever to to \nmake weeviate queries you train a seven \nbillion parameter and then it's much \nmore efficient to run and exactly what \nyou were saying far shot I agree \nstrongly with this that they're going to \nbe kind of llms over all of the tools \nthat that the LMS know how to conf how \nto control the apis like edian's \nexplaining with taking a query and \nsaying should I wait bm25 more heavily \nthan Vector search for this one or \nadding the symbolic wear filters to \nqueries and generally also I think just \num there's kind of two things to it like \nlarge language model tool use the tools \nhave apis and so the language model \nneeds to like you know behave exactly \nformat the you know they call this like \nconstrained output sampling or \nstructured parsing where it's like the \nllm needs to format the request \nperfectly so this kind of tuning I think \nis perfect for that and I think yeah I \nlove the parts of my brain kind of \nanalogy and how each one is smaller \nbecause if it's everything is a large \nmodel then it's like kind of expensive \nto tune but it comes into Vector \ndatabases too because like in addition \nto having specialized LMS to control \neach tool you also have specialized \nVector indexes that contain different \ntypes of knowledge maybe editing you \ncould talk about this is kind of \nsomething that topic that I always love \nthinking about is like when to separate \nmy data into multiple classes in weave \nmaybe also for new listeners we could \nquickly do what a class is and like when \nto separate it into different classes \nhow to think about adding filters versus \nuh classes \nyeah the the original motivation in off \nof the sort of class-based schema in vv8 \nwas to reflect the real world so in an \nearlier version of V8 we even had a \ndistinction between something a thing or \nan action that would sort of you know \ndescribe either either things or action \nthat's long gone because that led to \nmore confusion in the API than it \nactually helped but it kind of it's It's \nwhere the history of where the classes \ncome from like they were meant to \ndescribe real world things so if you \nhave books put your books in the book \nclass if you have \num I don't know chapters or something \nput them in the chapter class and that \nthat kind of like I'm already sort of \ngoing to the the next use case of this \nwhich is chunking up stuff so \num uh for for these retrieval tasks very \nvery common question or very common \noptimization problems basically how \nsmall like what what do I obtain a \nvector embedding for do I just create \none vector embedding for my entire book \ngreat if you're just trying to identify \nthe right book If you're trying to \nsearch through your book that's not \ngranular enough do I obtain a vector \nembedding for every word in my book well \ngreat if you're trying to find words not \nvery good if you're trying to find \ncontext because you're losing all the \ncontext you're sort of going back to the \noriginal steps of of vert to VEC so um \nthey're most likely something like the \nparagraph or maybe if it's a long book \nand you're just trying to get a high \nlevel search and maybe a chapter in the \nbook something like that and that is \nsomething that you can use the the uh \nvva class model for to retain that \nAssociation for example between a class \nand a chapter sorry between a book and a \nchapter in that book and that allows you \nto for example search through chapters \nbut then make a relation to the book and \nthen maybe do something without so if \nyou could potentially sort of make these \ngraph like connections and even jump to \nthe author then authored these books \nand as for your questions like when \nshould I use these links between objects \nof a class as opposed to a primitive \nfilter this is mainly a performance \noptimization so A Primitive filter is \ncheaper to run VBA it has a bitmap index \nfor uh for primitive filtering basically \nfor for building these allows for \nfilters so if you want to get the most \nperformance out of it it's probably \nfaster to to do it sort of on the object \nitself so essentially like a \ndenormalized schema in in sort of SQL \nslash nosql terms \num and and if you use these links it's \nmaybe sometimes easier to reason about \nso that's kind of the the trade-off do \nyou want something that's more easier \nthat's easier to understand versus \nsomething that's more performant \nyeah amazing and yeah just understanding \nthat kind of filtered agents like how \nfiltered search works with the vector \nindex and all that I think you kind of \nquickly mentioned desk SQL with a \ndifferent perspective but like this I \nthink also kind of in our broader \nconversation of just llms that use tools \nand like selecting which class book book \nchapter and that's like one kind of llm \nquery routing task but there's also kind \nof like is this a vector search or is \nthis an SQL search like if I say what is \nthe average age of my podcast listeners \nnot that I have a database \nthat I have that but like that would be \na SQL kind of query not a vector search \nquery so yeah I think just all this kind \nof routing and \nyou know it kind of yeah like this \nsystem architecture kind of thing of \nlike yeah like you know I don't think \nit's quite the same topic as \nmulti-tenancy but it's like kind of like \nhow you have all these different classes \nthat you run in the cloud then and like \nyou know maybe we could talk a little \nmore about like you know what does it \ntake to and we could actually kind of \npivot the topics kind of broadly into \njust like what kind of requirements are \nwe seeing to be running Vector indexes \nin the cloud \ncan I actually is it okay if I ask a \nquestion \nso it's related to the the question \nyou're asking to Connor I'm really \ncurious like what has been like \nthe one or two or three use cases that \nrelatively novel and we're really \nsurprised to see how well it worked \nwhile using a vector database to get \nthere like wow this works really well \nfor this use case right have their band \nsome of those come up and what were \nthose use cases what was surprising \nabout it was there anything interesting \nabout the architecture to get there \nyeah I think initially sort of if we if \nwe look at the pre-lm era the main use \nbecause of course Vector databases \nexisted before before chat GPT basically \nso the the whole sort of using them as a \nbuilding block for retrieval augmented \ngeneration is relatively new so before \nthat I think it was mainly just search \nwith contextual understanding so these \nlike very small differences in in the \ninput query like using the word not as a \nnegation or something or for example \nsearching for something that is that has \nwings but is not an airplane or \nsomething traditional keyword based \nbased matching it would match for \nairplane and then it would also match \nfor not which sort of completely mess up \nthe the um the the result quality so I \nthink this initially this was my my sir \nfor me one of those moments where like \nokay wow there is such potential in this \nso so basically the classical semantic \nsearch in a sense uh and then post llm \nor post a Chachi PT \num yeah it's gotten more into into all \nthese kind of \nchat bot and and \num \nthere was this moment we're like wow \nthis is this is so much bigger than just \nsemantic search there there's all these \nall these systems that \nI think the first time someone talked to \nme about generative AI in general it was \nthat was way back basically for me it \nwas a bit hard to make the connection \nlike okay yeah that's that's an awesome \nfield but I don't think that's a related \nfeeling at some point oh actually it is \nand that was that was such a \num I think that's not not an exact \nanswer to your question of what are the \ngreat use case but this sort of in my \npersonal Journey that was one of the the \nthings we're like oh wow okay there's \njust so much more to it and uh yeah \nseeing the first sort of chatbot \napplications uh that that users do uh um \nspecifically serve the chat with your \ndocuments kind of use case that's that's \nsuch a great one this giving this sort \nof more interactive kind of kind of uh \nfeel to it and then especially if this \nis like the typical demo cases that you \nwould see they're they're always like \ntake something from Wikipedia and this \nlike general purpose kind of kind of \nGeneral general knowledge kind of things \nbut then seeing our customers implement \nthis on like super domain specific data \nlike in the financial industry or \nsomething thing that is so cool to me \nbecause it's it's \nyeah it's it's sort of this this very \nthese very boring documents where I \nimagine people spend so much time going \nthrough them like extracting all the \ninformation and now you can automate it \nand you can automate it with something \nas simple as a single query that where \nyou tell the large language model hey \nretrieve the right stuff and then do \nsomething with it so that I think was \nwas for me uh definitely one of the eye \nopener cases maybe Conor maybe you have \na couple more \nyeah I think probably the biggest \neye-opener for me I think was you know \nBob was teaching me about \num oh it's called Uh like I don't think \nit's called disruption Theory sorry Bob \nI forgot the name of this thing but it's \nlike \nbut it's like about uh you know it's \nabout like this virtuous cycle of how \nyou kind of like have um distribution \nand customer experience and so kind of \nfor me just like that personalization \ncomponent that's achieved by llms that \nto me I think it like just how I can you \nknow go through the Twitter you know \nlike I like we all manage a ton of \nrelationships right like in the \ntechnology industry and it's like it's \nimpossible for me to keep up with what \nall everyone is doing every week for \nexample and so just having llms that can \nlike summarize what you know like say \nMichael going neural magic have done \nthis week and maybe like connect it with \nwhat I'm doing and like automatically \ngenerate these reports for me just this \nkind of like you know the personal \nexperience that you're able to give to \npotential users of your product as well \nas kind of like partners and \nIntegrations by having the llms like \ncombine knowledge sources that's \nprobably that's probably my favorite one \nyeah super cool and by the way that was \ntotally a selfish question on my part I \njust wanted to expose myself to what you \nall are saying being in this space um \nand yeah that's super exciting and I \nthink you mentioned magic did I hear \nthat correctly \noh yeah well that's a friend of mine \nwho's um you know the company he works \nat this company where they're working on \nLM inference acceleration it's just like \nan anecdote of saying like you know they \nthey have they post these new updates \nlike you know I don't know what their \nCadence of how many blog posts they do \nper week but let's say they do like four \nper week and let's say I have 20 such \ntechnology companies I want to keep up \nwith and now it's like 80 in a month and \nyou know I can't be expected to read all \nthis so like that kind of thing it that \nI think that just helps us connect with \neach other also like this kind of like \nsocial \nyeah I think that I mean I guess like \none more thing I really enjoy just that \nI've seen is exactly what we were \ntalking about earlier where we're \ntalking about searching across multiple \nindexes uh Eric also weave she's been \nexploring like llama index has built \nthese really great tools on top of \nweavate as the vector database and then \nthey're exploring like the sub question \nquery engine so I asked a question like \na weeviate feature what is ref to VEC \nand then it routes the question to one \nindex of blog posts one index of podcast \ntranscriptions and then one index which \nis the leviate code base and I mean the \ncode base we could talk about all sorts \nof things how you can use the levers of \nweviate to search through code bases but \njust seeing that in action the routing \nqueries to different indexes that is a \nmind-blowing thing of retrieve augmented \ngeneration for me \nsuper cool \nawesome so okay so I I would love to \nkind of pivot our topic into a little \nmore about \num you know we we Eddie and I'd actually \nlike to kick this off with kind of like \num you know one question I've always \nkind of found really interesting is like \nso with AWS cloud services you have like \nall these different machines and I've \nseen some things like of maybe like \nbenchmarking weeviate with like \ndifferent you know different particular \nmachines how do you think about that \nkind of that kind of thing \nso I've seen me talking about like \ninstance types yeah yeah yeah \num so \nI think what's helpful in this context \nis talk about like how do good how do \nhow do customers go about doing this and \nand why do it this way \num the best way to do this is when \nyou're trying to work backwards from \nlike what's the best instance type for \nme to do what I'm trying to do with Eva \num it's just to do a proof of concept \nright so this is something I do pretty \ncommonly with a lot of customers that I \nwork with \num we get an understanding of what \nthey're trying to do like what are some \nperformance kpis they're looking for and \nwe'll do some testing across instances \nright so there's so many different \ninstances at AWS right whoever you're \nworking with whether you have an account \nmanager or or like a specialist like \nmyself \num \nthey'll be able to guide you on like \nwhat are the options to test maybe \nnarrow down to like three or four \ndifferent instance types and then do \nsome testing \num and and see where see where it goes \nright like sometimes you have you know \nare you focused on and when \nI say this \nyour use case will determine \nwhat instance type you use and there's \nreally common patterns for specific use \ncases right you have all these building \nblocks from AWS and you'd be surprised \nhow often customers end up selecting the \nsame exact instance for a given use case \nright and what that means is that \nthere's a lot of tribe knowledge within \nAWS like when you're talking with \nsomeone and you're like hey this one use \ncase it's like we're only going to have \nintuition for what's going to be us but \nwe don't want to tell you we want you to \nget that conclusion on your own right so \nwe're going to set up an environment for \nyou to test it right because this is how \nthe tech World works right like we want \nyou guys to make the best decision for \nyou and will help guide you get there \nbut ultimately you need to get that data \nfor yourself right so you know versus \ntaking my word for it then you've built \nthe best solution for your company right \nso that's generally how we do it uh ask \nyour account manager for credits along \nthe way so you're not paying for it \nright so usually we can do that as well \nthere's obviously limitations right like \nyou can't have like a one year long POC \nfor example but yeah like we're more \nthan happy to help and that's generally \na good protocol to do it data data data \ngreat to hear this this use case-centric \nnature of it because this is exactly \nwhat we're seeing as well like \nbenchmarks are always lying in a sense \nthat they're optimized for one specific \nthing whatever you want to show in that \nthat particular Benchmark and I think \nfor especially for for users who are new \nto all of this if all they have is a \nbenchmark they're just going to pick \nwhatever in that particular Benchmark is \non top even if that's not at all what \nthey're neat what they need so for \nexample often benchmarks are optimized \nfor for either throughput or latency \nwhich is kind of a similar thing if you \nignore that that doesn't necessarily \nhave to scale like often they're single \nthreaded and then you'd have \nmulti-threaded queries and these kind of \nthings \num but something that that comes up way \nmore often in in the discussions that we \nhave with our clients is actually cost \nand none of these benchmarks optimize \nfor for cost so the question is like \nwhat is your actual query load what is \nyour throughput and then you see that \nthat all these Curves in these \nbenchmarks their actual throughput is so \nmuch lower and really what we have to \noptimize for is cost and then in bb8 \nthat could for example mean turn on \ncompression which is sort of another \nlatency versus versus accuracy versus um \nuh versus a memory footprint a trade-off \num but also of course machine sizing \nlike do you really need the machine that \nhas that allows you to to I don't know \n100 have two thousand as opposed to 1 \n000 queries per second if you have one \nquery per second and then you get these \nthese machines that are optimized maybe \nfor for more memory relative to CPU Etc \nand they're similar as as you said \num their patterns we also see these \npatterns like either your your uh very \nsort of on the on the throughput side \nthen on AWS I think this is typically \nwhat we see is like m6i or r6i machines \nuh or maybe you're more on the yeah on \nthe operating cost side then we see more \nfor for example uh the the I think m7g \nor the the AWS graviton I think they're \nthey're called so um long story short I \nreally like this it's it's so like yes \nof course we would like to to tell our \nusers yeah just do it like that or it \nCompares like that but really if you \nwant the best possible infrastructure \nsetup you just need to adjust to your \nuse case because every use case is \ndifferent yeah I totally agree it's such \na like honestly a distraction to be like \noh this is the best thing for this and \num \nthe the \nbest customers that I've worked with and \nwhen I say best customers what I really \nmean is \nwhat are the customers where I'm like \nwow I would join that company I really \nlike the way they're doing things right \nso the customers that I'm considering \nbest in that context \num they don't follow benchmarks like \nthey go down to what matters for me and \nnot going back to like the AWS \nperspective nine times out of ten price \nperformance is the name of the game so \nnot just performance not just price but \nprice performance which really means \ngoing down through a use case right or \nam I getting the best bang for my buck \nthe only time price performance is like \nbeen kind of de-prioritized a little bit \nis if security gets involved like a \nsecurity standard where we definitely \ncan't use it this way even though it's \nthe best price performance so therefore \nwe're willing to play pay more to do \nthis other way right but most of the \ntime you're right and it's it's price \nperformance right which was really use \ncase dependent \nI guess kind of for me I'm curious about \num you know price performance and how \nyou tune it and then I'm like I've \nalways been curious of me I I hope I I \nhope this doesn't go too into the kind \nof the details of like vector indexing \nand Vector search but this kind of like \nyou know you can tune hsw by adjusting \nthese type of parameters like EF you \nknow Max connections basically like how \ndensely connected that proximity graph \nis for how you route these queries and \nand you know I I think it's really \ninteresting with you know we've eaten \nnow has like product quantization which \nis reducing that memory by compressing \nthe vectors so maybe \num yeah I hope this isn't too boring of \na topic like for people who aren't super \nexcited about kind of nerding out about \nhow exactly you tune the the index for \nthe different computers but I'm sure \nthat our listeners are you know are \ninterested in that kind of conversation \nlike so how do you think about uh tuning \nwith this question for Eddie and who's \nreally been you know in the weeds of \nthis kind of thing now I'll try to make \nit exciting \num so so in in a nutshell these are all \nparameters that you can tune for a \nspecific trade-off and typically that \ntrade-off is either index time query \ntime or memory footprint so you \nmentioned Max connections for example \nthat's a parameter that literally leads \nto to so agents W is a graph based index \nhaving more Connections in the index \nmeans more memory because each \nconnection is essentially stored as yeah \nas a a number you can think of it sort \nof like the outgoing edges to other \nnodes are just un60 forms or something \nlike that so this is one of the knobs \nthat you can turn that make the index \nbigger but then because it's it's bigger \nit's better connected it's it's more \nsort of it's easier to go sort of this \nthis uh small world example I think that \nwe've used in another uh in in previous \npodcast so if you're if you're trying to \ngo from from a person in Europe to a \nperson in let's say Asia then you just \nneed to know someone I don't know \nsomewhere in the middle or so let's say \nhave these like I think there's this \ntheory that that with five or six or \nseven hop officer so you can basically \nget to any person in the world and and \nthat's that's uh the nature of that that \nproximity graph so the more connections \nyou have the easier it is to reach your \ngoal with with fewer Hops and that's one \nof those those uh turning knobs and then \num especially in in combination with \nproduct quantization that you just \nmentioned so product quantization \nreduces the memory footprint of the \nvector embeddings but not of the graph \nso if you want to get your your total \nmemory footprint down and the fact that \nyou're using a product quantization \ncould be an indicator that you've maybe \nalready said on that trade-off of query \nspeed versus memory footprint and \ntherefore operating cost you're already \nleaning towards reducing operating costs \nso then one way to potentially reduce it \nfurther is you could say in my index I \nwant to take that that same or do that \nsame trade-off and I want to trade off a \nbit of index memory footprint for higher \nlatencies and we say like okay fewer \nconnections which means the the graph \nfootprint is smaller and then in turn \nmaybe you have to search for it a bit \nlonger so this would be the query \nparameter that you would have to to uh \ntune so this gives you \num the effect on the infrastructure in \nyour cloud is essential deck if you tune \nthis well you could end up with the same \nuse case either needing 16 gigabytes of \nmemory or maybe 32 gigabytes of memory \nand \num of course \nthey're not they're not identical like \nyou would have for example higher career \nperformance on the one with 32 gigs as \nopposed to a 16. but if you take that \ninto consideration then \num it's it's easier to to plan your \ninfrastructures they have lots of ways \nthat said vv8 has reasonable defaults so \num there is a certain size where all of \nthis tuning doesn't matter and we try to \npick defaults where it can just get \nstarted and probably you'll know when \nyou have to tune them because you'll \neither reach out to us or you'll start \nrunning into like memory limitations \nwhere you look at your AWS Bill and you \nthink like hey maybe maybe I can get \nthat memory footprint down of it \num so this is for for mainly for the \nheavy production focus in large use \ncases \num but yeah it's good to know that you \ncan tune these things if you want to \nyeah and so I get kind of like this is \nkind of the question that sort of you \nknow selfishly I was hoping to get \nanswered in this podcast is I've always \nbeen you know from when I first was \nlearning about weave and I learned about \nhorizontal scalability kind of you know \nand I've I think I have a rough \nunderstanding of how you Shard each of \nthese kind of uh classes and then how \nyou scale out shards across machines and \nso yeah I'm just so curious to hear you \nknow hear your perspectives on how uh \nscaling out machines works in the cloud \nparticularly you know in this setting \nwhere you're running like a weeviate \ncloud service in AWS and so wev8 has \nsomething like you know again I I \nunderstand this a little bit sometimes \nit's my best to set up the question but \nlike I know you kind of have things like \nkubernetes where you have like here \nhere's kind of like the code for how you \nwould scale up to more machines so yeah \nmaybe you guys can take the Baton from \nhere like you know how are you how are \nyou thinking about like how we V8 can \nhave a service that then within AWS \nwould say okay we need you know 8 30 two \ngigabyte RAM that kind of thing \nso I'm gonna set up egn for this \nquestion I'll give like the high level \nanswer and then I have a feeling you're \ngonna know the very detailed answer how \nthis actually works in in your use cases \nthat you've seen so at a high level AWS \noffers something called Auto scaling \nwhich is basically like horizontal like \nvertical sailing is when you basically \nlike increase the horsepower of your \ninstance type whether that's like bigger \nGPU or more RAM whatever horizontal is \nbasically you add more instances to do \nwhatever you're trying to do and I if I \nrecall from my ASA days this is like the \nassociate Solutions Architects course \nthat you can take to learn more about \nAWS you can do things like monitor like \nyour CPU usage or your memory usage as \ntriggers to know when to do some \nhorizontal scaling \num so now I'm going to pass the mic to \neating to talk about like well what \nthings do you monitor do horizontal \nscaling what are things you look for how \ndo you actually architect it using \norchestration like you touched some \nkubernetes right kubernetes is one way \nof container rising and then doing \nscaling \num but yeah I'd love to hear like what \nare the specifics of what UC customers \ndo \nyeah kubernetes and vv8 are kind of \nintertwined in the way but also they're \nnot so there's nothing in VBA that that \nwill make it kubernetes specific but \nit's just one of the the operations \ndecisions where we said like you get so \nmuch for free with kubernetes service \nDiscovery scaling rolling updates like \nall these these kind of things that we \nsaid like this is just how we want to \nrun bv8 \num technically you don't have to you \ncould just spin a manual ec2 machines or \nso and just just uh build it that way \num on the the sort of cluster \narchitecture slash design part \num what's sometimes a bit difficult in \nVector search is that um indexes are \nhard to split up once you once you have \nthem so sometimes you're actually forced \nto do vertical scaling which you kind of \nwant to avoid because well if you have a \nreplication then at least you can do it \nwith with zero downtime but it's way \neasier of course to do horizontal \nscaling and one way that you can achieve \nthat with vv8 is the multi-tenancy \nfeature because the multi-tenancy \nfeature schedules each tendon so each \ntenant is essentially like a lightweight \nchart in in vb8 and each of those those \ntenants is scheduled on exactly one or \nif you spread it out on multiple nodes \nbut that means the next time you add a \ntenant it can be scheduled on a new note \nso if you would say your load is let's \nsay you have a multi-tenancy application \num someone can sign up for your let's \nsay personalized chat Bots like a user \ncan sign up can upload documents and can \nchat with their documents and then you \nhave 10 000 users then each of those \nyour users would be represented by one \ntenant in in BBA and of course these 10 \n000 users like the moment you start \nusing V8 you would have some of them but \nyour goal is to sign up more of them so \nideally you add more users every day and \nthis is where it gets really interesting \nbecause at some point you're going to \nrun out of space and then you can very \neasily scale horizontally you can just \nsay Okay add more nodes to the cluster \nand then all your new tenants that you \nsign up from from that point on they \nwill be scheduled to those new notes and \nthat gives you basically infinite linear \nfailing for the number of of notes one \nthing that's that's not released yet but \nthat's currently on a roadmaps then also \nto rebalance this and redistribute this \nso right now it's like once it's \nscheduled on a specific node it's fixed \nbut that is an upcoming uh feature as \nwell to then give you more control over \nmoving that data around and this is this \nis one of the common cases that we see \nwhere people basically use horizontal \nscaling to um to increase the capacity \nof their their Vector search costs yeah \nI mean that's that's perfect you can ask \nfor a better way to scale than aligning \nyour horizontal scaling with number of \nusers right so that's that's perfect \nyeah that was super interesting I I love \nthat kind of yeah the the way that you \nfirstly separate you know horizontal \nscaling and tie that with multi-tenancy \nand then compare it to Vertical scaling \nwhen you need it because of the vector \nindex I think you know the the the cloud \nservice that orchestrates managing that \nfor large apps I I find that all to be \nso fascinating and kind of like one \nother topic I'm very curious about it's \num kind of related to this idea of \nhaving like a product that manages cloud \nservices is kind of what becomes \ndifferent when you're running it like \nprivately like you know we see this with \nlike you know just as a random example \nlast night I attended a generative AI \nHealthcare Meetup in Boston and they're \nall you know we need to run this \nprivately so like what does that mean \nfrom the perspective of aw you know AWS \nunderstand it's like public Cloud I can \njust kind of like go to uc2 and get \nrunning how does Amazon think of our AWS \nthink about uh private cloud \num when you say private Cloud I just \nwant to make sure we're talking the same \npage here are you referring to like \nsomeone owning like a data center within \na Colo or are you talking about like \nsomething where hey \num this needs to be all happening within \nmy VPC within my own cloud single \ntenancy for this one company everything \ndoes not leave this this thing right so \nwhich one of those two you're referring \nto \num I'm certainly interested in both I \nthink um I think like kind of as I \nmentioned that like Healthcare in Boston \nthing the latter Probably sounds like \nthat case where you're you know really \nlike nothing can leave here and I I \nthink the other thing that's really an \ninteresting part of this topic is kind \nof like having the llm the large \nlanguage model as well as the vector \ndatabase both be in that kind of setup \ntogether I I think yeah yeah we can talk \nabout both of those so \num let me let me talk about the latter \nfirst because this is where I do talk to \nmy customers about and I'm certainly \nhappy to share like a perspective of \nwhat I'm hearing about like colos and \ndata centers \num so as far as AWS and keeping things \nextremely private \num let's kind of walk through like a \nlittle mental model of what an \narchitecture could look like so when \nyou're using AWS you can use Virtual uh \nyou can use vpcs right and within a VPC \nlike you can be totally isolated from \nthe rest of the internet or even other \nAWS users right \num in that context you can easily have \nyour vector database be in there right \nso everything's within your VPC right \nwhatever instance you want to host we \nbeat on for example can be there and \nthen the question becomes well okay \nlet's say that I want to \num make sure that my prompting never \nleaves my bpc either I don't want anyone \nto see my prompting and I don't want \nanyone to see the responses from that \nprompting right \num the the first level of like Standard \nSecurity that you can do is by using \nlike a service called like I mentioned \nearlier Amazon bedrock with bedrock the \nway that it works is you effectively get \nan API within your VPC and it can be set \nup in a way \nwhere um basically via private link it \nconnects to where the model is hosted \nwhich means you can't see the weights of \nthe model but because it's private link \nand it's single tenancy this is all \nthings you can forget with AWS uh what \nthat means is nobody else gets to access \nthat stuff right so you can almost think \nof it as like you have your VPC bubble \nand it kind of extends out to another \ncluster somewhere but it's all single \ntendency no one else gets to see it and \nit comes back to you so in that scenario \neverything's completely private and it's \nonly for you \num and we have customers that like for \nexample have fedramp \num security standards that they need to \nreach right so I just talked to a \ncustomer this last week that's using a \ndifferent service called Amazon \nsagemaker jumpstart where you can host \nmodels uh in a similar fashion within \nyour VPC \num and let's say for example you wanted \nto use llama 2 right \nwith jumpstart you would provision some \ninstances \num for your sagemaker endpoints that \nyour vector database can interface with \nand that endpoint you get to decide what \ntype of instance that is right so for \nexample you can have llama 2 hosted on \na100s you can have llama 2 hosted on \ninferential two and you manage that but \nwhat we do for you as a user is make \nsure that that instance is single \ntenancy and you're the only person \ntouching that and no one else gets to \nsee that so you're now \ncompletely containing how you're \ninterfacing with these llms whether or \nnot \ntheir proprietary or open source right \nand this does come up quite a bit and \nwhen I was making the comment earlier \nabout like price performance and \nsometimes security this is basically \nwhat I was alluding to right like so if \nif for example a customer most nine \ntimes out of ten customers like I'm \ngonna as long as everything \nuh is done via bedrock and I know that \nit doesn't go to the model provider I'm \nhappy security wise and then let's just \nfocus on price performance \nbut like what if a customer says no I \nneed additional layer of security then \nmaybe for some reason they have to use \nsagemaker jumpstart because they there's \nmore knobs there right and at that point \nit goes back to price performance and in \nthe case a lot of times what I see is \nlike a lot of times you know these these \nmodels are pretty large and that means \nyou have to use pretty beefy pretty \nlarge instances to hold them right so I \ndon't know how much \num off the top of my head like how much \nmemory llama 2 takes for the 70 billion \nbut there's a good chance that you \neither have to run it on a100s or \ninferential two \nright so if that's the case like these \nare beefy instances they get expensive \nso you you better and this is where you \nstart to think about well maybe we \nshould use a 13 billion or the 7 billion \nparameter version right so this gets in \nthe whole price performance thing right \num you're always working back for some \nuse case but \nbasically everything worked back Works \nbackwards from from a privacy \nperspective keep everything within the \nVPC nothing leaves \num that seems to nine times out of ten \naddress security concerns from customers \num there are other use cases allowance \ngo into like the whole KOLO data center \npart of the question there are customers \nthat have data that they just cannot put \nin the cloud period they cannot leave \ntheir own their own data centers right \nso in those use cases \num obviously I don't have as much \npurview into that given that I work at \nAWS but in those use cases \nthese customers tend to buy like \npre-made clusters from other companies \nwhich you may or may not be elastic \num that part I'm not sure about but I'm \npretty sure that you know if you're if \nyou're a super large company that owns \nyour own data center you're probably \ngoing to find a way for it to be elastic \nand I have no reason to suspect that \nthey couldn't do horizontal scaling in \nthat type of environment as well but I \nthink that most companies are able to \nuse LMS in the cloud with the exception \nof companies that have data that cannot \nleave their own on-premises data centers \nyeah no that's really amazing and \nfirstly thanks so much because I I hear \nthat question a lot too and now I feel \nlike I have a good answer right I think \nit's also interesting whether you need \nthe vector database private or the llm \nprivate or both and and kind of maybe \nsome nuances around that and yeah I \nthink this kind of like single tenant \nall that kind of thinking around how you \ndo this thing yeah all that's really \ninteresting uh Eddie and I'm curious if \nmaybe you have some thoughts on like um \nyeah that kind of like tenancy and the \nand the vpcs as farshad describes \nyeah yeah so with tenancy because I \ntalked about multi-tenancy before but in \na very different context so it's kind of \na a difficult term because before \nmulti-tenancy referred to our users \nhaving multiple users in this case now \ntenancy refers to sort of the isolation \nboundaries within AWS so \num so so let's say our chat bot \napplication from before is an AWS \ncustomer they don't want their data to \nbe mixed up with competing chatbot \napplication but still within sort of \nthis single tenancy setup they might \nhave multiple users so it's a a term \nused in multiple settings nevertheless \nthe concepts are exactly the same for us \nso data that shouldn't leave a certain \nrealm and this is this is something \nwhere \num the the sort of again those using the \nsame term the single tendency nature of \nyour own bv-8 deployment in your private \nVPC in your Cloud tenant \num that that gives you the capability to \nstay completely in control so I'm \ntouching upon this at the very beginning \nif if you want just something fast up \nand running just use your VBA cloud \nservice or you deviate cloud service in \nthat definition of tenancy is \nmulti-tenant so that means other \ncustomers that use the vv8 cloud service \nrun in the same AWS project for example \non our cloud service if you have these \nrequirements for for strict isolation \nyou can run it in your own um yeah we \nsay in your own VPC and the VPC is in \nyour Cloud tenant so it's basically \nwhatever kind of boundaries you you want \nto Define and you can do this this is \nsomething that we're we're launching \nright now as we're recording this it's \nnot public yet maybe it will be when \nwe're \ndepends on it depends on how long it \ntakes to edit this or we're just about \nto launch on the bvl not on the on the \nAWS Marketplace we're going to deviate \non the AWS Marketplace \num and it's a one-click deployment kind \nof setup where we can do exactly that so \nif you have an existing VPC you can \ndeploy into that VPC if you're starting \nfrom scratch you can create a new VPC \nand this is the the kind of setting \nwhere you can make sure that because \nyour data that's contained in vv8 is \nthen wherever V8 is deployed so exactly \nthe same concept it can never be \naccessed by anyone else it can never be \nmixed up with someone else no one else \nhas access you are completely in control \nif you tomorrow you decide you want to \ntear it down you want to delete the \ndisks you are in in that kind of kind of \ncontrol which is great for for all kinds \nof yeah security compliance Etc settings \nuh the the downside basically is that \nit's it's potentially a bit more \noperations effort because now you're \nrunning vb8 and this is where our hybrid \nSAS idea comes in so with hybrid SAS \nbasically the vva team helps you run \nthis so depending on how much data care \nyou're willing to give away for example \none thing that you could opt into is \nsaying like hey I want to push my \nmetrics to the vva team then what we can \ndo is monitor the metrics so you can say \nlike hey you're about to run out of XYZ \nor we see a pattern here there or maybe \nif something happens \num then then and you're reaching out for \nfor support to us and we can say like \nokay we we have the kind of Diagnostics \nuh tools that we need or another option \nis like even if you can't even share \nmetrics then we can also in the in the \nsort of uh least common denominator \nwould be we can jump on a zoom call and \nmaybe there's maybe a sort of figure out \nwhat's going on together so you get like \nvarious levels of of support contracts \nand support uh settings in that that \nkind of hybrid SAS setting where um yeah \nthe the sort of underlying thing is you \nown your data and we help you with the \noperations part as much as you want \nyeah I could I could see could see a lot \nof customers wanting to use the \nmarketplace option you're talking about \nwhere it's within the customer's VPC \num \nI would love to do a Blog with you where \nwe show customers how easy it is to do \nand maybe like a use case that it works \nreally well for \num because I think a lot of customers \nwould appreciate that \nawesome let's do that yeah I'm sure all \nlisteners the podcast are going to be \nexcited for that blog post as well and \num so it kind of one you know Eddie and \nyou mentioned you know we get on AWS \nMarketplace I think that's one of these \nbig headlines with our podcast and like \nsomething we're super excited to \nannounce and uh far sure I'm just really \ncurious like um you know like we V8 you \nknow the startup and now being on the \nAWS Marketplace if you can maybe talk us \nthrough like um you know the what does \nit take to get your cloud service on the \nAWS Marketplace \nwhat does it take to get your cloud \nservice on the AWS Marketplace \num well technically Eden knows more than \nme now so since he's since he's actually \ngone through it but at a high level \num AWS has so many different ways to \npartner with um basically companies or \nstartups \num and what we do is there's two methods \nmaybe more \none method is through AWS Marketplace \nMarketplace basically makes it easier \nfor you to consume \num partner products and services through \nAWS Marketplace and what's kind of \ninteresting is that if you like \nhave you know contracts with AWS \nMarketplace can actually count towards \nthat right so in other words there's \nincentive for companies to go out there \nand to use Marketplace to consume things \num rather than going directly to for \nexample BBA right so in other words \nthere's incentive for me to use consume \nmean to consume VA through database \nMarketplace and go directly to them \nright and it makes things easier for \nbilling reasons right you go through one \nplace to do everything and the process \nfor doing it is basically you apply \num I if I'm not mistaken you can also in \nparallel be a part of the AWS partner \nnetwork if you choose to and that has \ntwo categories one is consultant and one \nas a technology partner you can think of \nConsulting as like hey you can hire our \ndevelopers to help you build whatever \nwhether that's infrastructure or app \nlevel and we can do that and then at the \ntechnology level it's basically like SAS \nthings right so we be for example be a \ntechnology partner and be on AWS \nMarketplace \num it's not necessarily a difficult \nprocess but there is like a the process \nof going through like architecture \nreviews making sure things are set up \nand meaning standards with AWS \num and the most important thing I would \nsay is like if you're a company thinking \nabout APN or Marketplace \num \nI've I've never I'm gonna speak \nanecdotally here right I have to be \ncareful here \num it's not a you do this and you get \nadditional Revenue it's not the way to \nthink about it the way to think about it \nis this thing uh you've already got a \nfire you've got you've kindled your fire \nit's going and this thing is fuel it \nwill scale you it will add much more \nopportunities to your existing \nopportunities right and the way a lot of \nEnterprises think about this is \num you make it frictionless for me to \nconsume your SAS product you're making \nit frictionless right so if if no one's \never heard of you before it's going to \nbe very difficult for a Marketplace to \nmagically get new customers but if you \nalready have a presence in the world an \nEnterprise can say oh and you're in \nMarketplace so this is going to be easy \nfor me to consume you that's how you \nshould be thinking about it right so it \ndoes work but there's like a level \nexpectation of how it works it's \nimportant to consider we have a lot of \ncompanies that make a ton of money off \nof marketplace and APS very successful \nfor them but what I don't want to do is \nmislead someone and say you do this and \nyou magically get Revenue through AWS \nright \nyeah that perfectly matches our \nexperience I think the the motivation to \nonboard into the marketplace was because \nwe had customers asking like hey I would \nlove to buy this through the marketplace \nbut you're not on it can you get on the \nmarketplace \nyeah exactly \nawesome well Eddie and far should I I \nlove this podcast I think it was such a \ngreat tour you know beginning with kind \nof Trends and Vector databases and \nretrieve vlogments generation stepping \ninto this you know machine provisioning \nhorizontal scalability multi-tenancy you \nknow all these Cloud stuff I just it's \nso amazing so both thank you so much for \njoining the podcast and sharing this \nknowledge I learned so much \nthank you both super fun \nyeah same here thank you \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Farshad Farahbakhshian and Etienne Dilocker on
