{"text": "Introduction and demo by Bob van Luijt during FOSDEM 2020 about the Weaviate Vector Database. More info: ... \nyes thank you so much well thank you for \nhaving me \nso it's indeed it's a loss of the day so \nit's like outside and I saw like a lot \nof people already drinking beers and \nstuff so it's like I hope that there's \nstill people in the room so thank you \nfor listening so this is like yeah last \nyear my my colleague HN was here any he \npresents for the first time we've yet \nand what we're trying to do and we've \ndone a lot in the year so today I wanna \nI wanna show you actually an update and \nway more things about we v8 and a lot of \nthings have changed also the things that \nwe've changed into so quickly agenda \nwhat I want to talk about so first of \nall it's about what it is because they \nwork up you know we're new we're new on \nthe scene so yeah so what is it secondly \nI want to talk about what has changed \nsince last year or presented here and \nthis year I want to talk a little bit of \nthe about technology and last but not \nleast of course I want to give it demo I \nwant to show it in action all right so \nthat's the that's what I'm gonna do so \nfirst about the about we've yet so we \nhit it an over soared smart growth \nthat's what it is and what we mean with \nthat well the fact that it's open source \nthat is the usual suspects right so \nsource lives on get up \nbut you can use that using docker docker \ncompose and communities so we have said \nall out of the box for you \nit is smart because of something which \nwe call the confectionery and if you \nnever heard about the context unary \nthat's fine because we invented it and \nI'm about to explain to you what it is \nand what it does and I want to use I'm \ngonna use one buzzword sorry for that \nbut what I what is it that serious \nit's it a serious notion so sometimes \npeople talk about like the AI first \narchitectures so like can we build \nsystems that have like these machine \nmodels built into them that we can build \nnew solutions and ask you new ideas and \nthat's what we try to solve with \nsemantic models so what makes it in our \ncase what we like to call smart is the \nbuilding semantic model and the graph is \nwell I don't have to in this room I \ndon't have to you know share to people \nwhat the graph is but the we we've \nchosen to use graph QL and the reason \nwhy I've done that is because we see of \ncourse there's like a lot of graph \nexperts you know you sparkle or sorry \nfor those kind of things but sometimes \nwhen we have to fail poor to find a \nlittle bit more difficult we see that \nthey really like to work with graph QL \nso we really embrace graph GL and it's \ncompletely 100% graph QL based so that's \nhow we define what our smart graph is \nand we're the smarter if you can do \nthree things \nfirst thing is semantic search so what \nyou can do and that's also what I will \ndemo to you what we know from \ntraditional search if I may call it like \nthat we search for keywords right so if \nwe write about the company Apple we \nactually need to search for Apple but in \nrefute you don't necessarily have to so \nif you add company within an apple but \nyou search for example what's the \ncompany the business related to the \niPhone it will still find your data \nobject company with the name app we also \ncan do based on that it's automatic \nclassification so we can automatically \nmake edges in the graph based on the \nsemantics of your that object and last \nbut not least we can do knowledge view \npresentation and this is often what's \nalways also refer that's like nowadays \nit's like it's the knowledge graph but \nit's like I wouldn't say we're \nnecessarily in notes graph but tea you \ncan create those similar representations \nso those are the three things the three \nuse cases that we can help you with so \nsomething important to share a base on \nwhat we did last year so the best way to \nexplain is a little bit on time and what \nI mean with that is like that we saw of \ncourse a lot of data bases in the past \nthere were more relational base right so \njust you know I wrote column structure \nwork on structures and tables and then \nof course we got these graph databases \nso for example had the people from naio \nare in room so they made a beautiful \nbeautiful database like that and we \nchose a year back to store our \ninformation with Yun's \nand what we did was that we had that \nsemantic element that but I will explain \nthe confectionary note I will explain \nwhat that is we had that as a feature \nbut last year we decided to just double \ndown on that semantic element so we got \ncompletely rid of the implementation \nyarn\u00eds and we created basically \neverything ourselves \nand we that means that we now only have \nthat context nary to store that \ninformation in and we actually this is a \ncrown so we actually figured out like \nthis is actually we're really happy that \nwe made the decision because now we \ncould really bring something new \nyou know to need to stay something \ndifferent and a different way to handle \nyour data objects and work with them so \nwe store everything in a semantic space \nthat's what we do and now if you go like \nwow semantic space I'm gonna explain \nwhat we mean with that so but just keep \nthinking when I talk about semantic \nspace I'm talking about the context in \nER so imagine it like this if you go to \na I'm compliance as you can see let's \nsay if you go to a grocery store and you \nhave shopping list and on that shopping \nlist you might have four items a banana \nwashing powder you're looking for an \napple and a piece of bread so if you go \nin the supermarket then you find a \nbanana you know that an apple is gonna \nbe closer by than the bread or at \nwashing powder and if you move towards \nthe bread you know that you're actually \ngetting closer to the washing powder I'm \nmoving more away from the fruit that's \nhow we store data in the space and so \nthat's the metaphor to actually imprint \nthe problem that we solve and we do that \nto something that we that we call the \nconfectionary and I'm gonna give you a \nlittle bit of background where we're \ncoming from and what's different to \nother solutions that around here so if \nyou go all the way back again time to \nthe to the 1950s there was like a famous \nquote and I said like a word can be \ncharacterized by the company it keeps \nand but it basically means that you \nwould say that the word Paris would be \nmore closely related to France then it \nwould be to Holland for example or the \nUS and New York would be more closely \nrelated to the US then for example Spain \nand it basically went for all words and \na lot of research was done there and \nthen we jumped for it and then with the \nwhole machinery boom we saw there was a \nlot of work being done with with based \non machine learning and these were \nembeddings and then we also sort of us \nand it was like we got first word to \nfact got gloss and nowadays had what \nthey call in the academic realm which \nthey call a state of the Arts Cobert but \nif we now put on our engineering hat \nwe really fell in love with glove and \nwhy did we fall in love it laughs \nbecause beard has multiple \nrepresentations of a word in a data set \nbut glove doesn't cloth has one vector \nrepresentation for every word and the \ncritique that often got was that well if \nyou for example aim Apple Apple can mean \nof course fruit but it can also mean the \ncompany and but we wanted to solve the \nproblem in a different way but it's \nengineers we were very happy with this \nbecause now we could index it we could \nindex those words in a storage mechanism \nso if you start a we if yet you can \nimagine it like this it's an empty space \nthat you start you choose a language not \na programming language but a spoken \nlanguage so let's say for example \nEnglish and the space is filled with all \nthose words so for example if you find \nApple you find nearby fruit you find \nnearby company and you might also find \niPhone and these representations that we \nstore they have a 600d mention 'l v \npresentation which is very fancy but it \nhas to do with compression that kind of \nstuff and the thing that we did is this \nif you store a data object like this so \nfor example the class company with the \nname apple founded in 1976 etc and in \nwhen i demo i will show you how the \nlexie works but if you sell information \nwhat we've here does that it creates a \nstring of the words and the concepts \nthat are in there and it takes those \nconcepts and it funnels them down how \ndoes it do that it says like it takes \nthe lydian distance it combines that \nwith e it's this sounds very fancy but \nwith the logarithmic function based \namong the occurrence of the word so for \nexample company might occur less often \nthan the word Apple so then we say the \nword company is more important and then \nwe even work with word boosting so that \nyou can say certain words are important \nin my data object but what we do with \nthat is that we create our search our \nfirst object in our graph and it gets \nits own factory presentation so now if \nwe have an empty v8 with those words in \nthat and we store our first \ndata objects that you can see there \nthere it is it lifts that's where it \nlives in the vector space that's what we \nmean so now if we query for let's say a \ncompany an iPhone it can look in the \nnearby space and find that that object \nso now without even having I phone into \nthat object we can still find it and \nthat's the thing that we created then we \nthought okay this is this is our thing \nright this is our golden goose egg \nbecause now we have different ways of \ncreating graphs and actually query truly \nso this example for example might look \nsomething like this so if I have a data \nset with companies and this would be my \ngraph QL query where I say that yet give \nme things which are companies and I'm \ngonna have their names but explore them \nby iPhone I might forget this result \nApple and as you see iPhone it's nowhere \nin the dead object and if I have that \nsame data set and we say well a little \nbit more abstract organize these \ncompanies on the concept of Redmont I \nmight get back Microsoft and that's how \nwe structure our graph so and so that's \nbasically what what we view this and as \na developer vd8 comes with a few \nfeatures so the first things that's that \nconfectionery comes all out of the box \nyou don't have to do your training you \ndon't have to set it up whatever it \ncomes all out of the box or basically a \nlot of the container I should say adding \ndata happens to the HTTP API but calling \ndata to the graph QL API it's completely \ncontainerized so you can run it wherever \nyou want and because we use that vector \nspace it's very very scalable you can \nscale that space very very tremendously \nbig so I think the the biggest one that \nwe ever try it was a few was a few \nbillions it gets pretty big and \nsomething that we have in the pipeline \nand maybe I can show you that next year \nbut is that we also can create peer to \npeer networks of v v8 so that we can \npoint to semantic elements in different \ngraphs so that we don't have to agree \nany more on our ontologies or on our \nschemas but that's like that's that's in \nthe me \nso a little bit about graph QL so EV so \nwhen I demoed it so how we structure our \nyou graph here this is the the UX if you \nwill of our graph QL so we have a get \nfunctions first the other one is an \naggregate function but I going to talk \nabout the gasp function we have a \nsemantic kind which we make a \ndistinction between singing selections \nnouns and verbs they have the class the \nclauses the property a property might \nhave reference and then the property \nitself and what you can do you can have \nthese semantic filters on top of that so \nthere here you see for example the \nexplore a filter and they can search for \nconcepts but you can even move away from \nconcepts of move towards concepts and I \nwill demo that to you in a bit demo so \nnow we get to the demo so now you might \nwant to said well how does it actually \nlook so what I did is that I spun up a a \ndocker container if you want to do it \nyourself \nif you go to our websites and without \ntechnology and then you simply click we \nv8 and then you find all the \ndocumentation the installation gives you \njust a we v8 but what I'm going to demo \nto you is this news publications that \nare set and if you click that one \nthere's just one simple docker compose \ncomment that you can run that you can \nplay you know around with it yourself so \nthere's a meta endpoint which I'm just \nrunning just to make sure yes so that \nit's running well so let's first look at \na schema so this is an example of schema \nso here you see I have the class \npublication and I have I have the name \nnames or the name of the publication but \nfor example as I said the headquarter G \nlocation which is our geo coordinates \nhas articles etc etcetera this is how we \nstructure the schema this key that's \nimportant because we will see that back \nwhen we use graphical to query and the \nthings that we actually store look like \nthis so for example you see an article \nthe article has an ID a beacon is a \nreference in our graph but why do we \ncall it beacon because we do it in space \nso it's a beacon in the space and then \nhere you see for example a summary of \nthe article the title of the article and \nthe URL where the article actually comes \nfrom so that's how it's structured so \nwe've created a simple \nGUI that you can use to actually you \nknow look through and search to the to \nthe graph so you can visualize stuff but \nI wanna I want to dive into the the \ngraphic your queries so let me show you \nsimple query so if I say get thinnies \nand I want to have I wanna have a \npublication and I want to see the name \nthis would be valid query that you see \nrise in folk Financial Times Wyatt New \nYork and economist etc now what I now \ncan do is that I can say well I want to \nI want to explore for the concepts let's \nsay business and I'm gonna limit it to \nthree results just that it's easier \nreadable so I know as I do the same \nquery but explore based on the concepts \nof business so if I now run the square \nyou see Financial Times The New York \nTimes International times etc but you \nsee the word business the meditech it's \nnowhere there that's what comes from the \nconfectionary or if I would say fashion \nand I would run it then you see it \nstarts for example with VOC so that's \nhow we've structured it and how it works \nbut that's not not only going for like \nsmall strings but also for a lot of \nlarger text objects so for example if I \nwould say get things article and I would \nsay show me the title of the article and \nwe run the query so now you see all \nthese articles about a variety of topics \nyou see brexit so you can see when we \nwhen we actually pull to that end but \nit's just a variety of topics in here \nbut if I now say well I want to have \nthose articles I'm gonna use the explore \nfunction again and again I say well I \nwant to explore for the concepts let's \nsay music and I'm gonna limit the \nresults again just for the sake of \nreadability \nso same query but now based on the \narticles so if a run that's you say like \nyou see fair enough the first one has \nthe word musical but then it's about \nGwen Stefani and then it's about John \nLennon so you see the word music is not \nnecessarily in there but it organized \nlike that automatically so now even if \nyou want to filter further in this in \nthis graph what you can do is that you \ncan say well the question we have actual \nhow do we do pagination because if you \nhave the 600 dimensional space what \nwould be the next page so what we've \ndone is this so we said well we can \nactually for example move towards a \nconcept so I can say well move towards \nthe concept for example of The Beatles \nso I guess you already know what will \nhappen if I do that so and I give it a \ncertain force the force is how strongly \nyou want to push towards this concept \ninside the vector space so let's say \nit's a little bit arbitrary but let's \nsay 85% so if I do that now you see that \nJohn Lennon the article with John Lennon \ncomes first and if I say like I'm more \nlike a stones person I hate the Beatles \nthen of course you can also do move away \nfrom the concept of the Beatles same \nquery and we see John Lennon is done and \nnow the question is like ok so what \nmakes it so like now the traditional \ngraph people are like yeah but I haven't \nseem to do the graph in action yet so \nthat's just very simple because you \ncould say for example has authors and we \ncan say on author the author is a name \nso this is how we structure the graph so \nnow you see huh so you see the graph \nobject here that says first the title of \nthe article and if it has authors and on \nactually the authors that are related to \nthis and them to this article \nI think if time allows it there's one \nmore second I still quickly show a more \nthing yes \nso the Isle is wrong within which I \ncompletely forgot because there's \nanother problem that we also try to \nsolve for this and I want to show you \nthat going back to the publication's so \nquickly going back to the publication's \nthings publication and then I say the \nname of the publication when when you \nglanced over this you might have noticed \nthat we have all these publications but \nwe have the International New York Times \nthe New York Times Company and the New \nYork Times in there three times which is \na problem because of course you want to \nrepresent concepts but in a database we \nhave the same concept represented three \ntimes so we have something for that \nwhich we can do is that we can say what \nwe want to \ngroup concepts together so let me say \nI'm gonna do the type merge them \ntogether I've gotta give a four so how \nbig do we need to look in the vector \nspace before merging and then I can say \nwell do that with 5% so if I now run \nthis query you'll see that it merged \ntogether the International New York \nTimes New York Times Company and the New \nYork Times but if I now do a graph query \nso I say it has articles on article the \ntitle of the article it even now merges \ntogether those different articles from \nthose different publications into the \nsame concept so that's what we have \nthat's how it works \nOh way more features the automatic \nclassification I didn't even get to show \nyou that but you can play around with it \nbecause well we're at first M so this \nsoftware is open source you can play \naround with it you can set it up \nyourself you can create your own graphs \nof cementec graphs I should say that's \nmy story in a nutshell thank you all for \nlistening and if you like it and if you \ngo to our website then I just have one \nquestion so this is our website if you \ngo here that you can sign up to our \nnewsletter cylinder or you can click on \nthe get up star button if you want to \ndon't promote a little bit so that's \nabout this is our website thank you very \nmuch for listening \n[Applause] \nwhy are you sure about it there's a \ngreat question so let me let me start \nwith the first answer to the first \nquestion so and sorry if I went to open \nit quickly too quickly because it's this \nwhole everything where that tolls also \non the website in detail but that's \nwhat's happening here we always know use \nthe same algorithm so if you would have \na data object with a longer sentence \nlike for example the summary or the \ntitle the articles that you've seen it \napplies the same algorithm so it says \nlike first I take all these individual \nwords then I find this center position \nbetween those words then I weighed them \nbased on the occurrence so certain words \nare seen as more important than other so \nit weighs it towards that and then we \nhave this optional word boosting that \nyou can say in this specific case this \nwas very important so move more towards \nthat that's how we create those vector \nposition so regardless if you're \nquerying or if you're adding data that's \nhow we do it so that's why we also \nbecame agnostic about the fact that \nloves about single words and because we \nlearned that if we saw with the first \nprototype we did way back what's very \nsimple we say okay I have the word Apple \nshow me what's nearby and then as you \nwould expect as glove does it says like \nwell iPhone iPhone but I also found \nfruit and then we did something very \nsimple which okay now go and sit in the \ncenter between Apple and iPhone show me \nagain what happens and then you see \nactually that that successful and if I \nif I may I can actually quickly show \nthat yeah I'm the lost okay so like ship \nI should have waited Elliott said go \nahead and thank you so there's a \nconfectionary endpoint where you can say \nwell concepts so if I now literally do \nwhat I just said so if I would say Apple \nthen you see your Apple iTunes Google \npreview on and now of course in this \nexample we don't see of course the fruit \nbut let's say if I would do Apple and \nnot based on the company but on fruit so \nI concatenate them Apple and fruit you \nsee how it now starts to get better and \nbetter in those results so and that's \nhow it the algorithm works so you can \nplay around with this also yourself on \nthis on this end point and the other \nquestion \nyeah sure so we were of course we also \nliked half we were also a business so we \nhave like so the core is like open \nsource but we built like a shell around \nthat so we currently have six companies \nusing this on a large scale in a variety \nof industries also retail oil and gas \nall those kind of things and these \ngraphs get pretty big and especially if \nyou scale the communities cluster its \nfast which is something I'm now I could \nsay that we fence li-like architected \ndebt but it was actually something we \ngot for free because we just the Dynamo \nis just vectors only vectors and that's \nof course very fast to scale and to \nsearch through so the answer that \nquestion is yes I don't know and I love \nthe idea so we're definitely going to \ntry that out I don't know I don't it's a \ngreat idea we haven't we haven't tried \nthat yet so what we currently do is that \nwe just have we've hidden in a language \nso darts French English of course but we \nhaven't tried that yet so if you don't \nmind then it would be fantastic to or of \ncourse you can try this yourself or we \ncan do it together \nbut that would be fantastic it's a it's \na great idea and I don't know thank you \nI hope you all enjoyed it enjoy Boston \ntomorrow and show the evening of course \nthank you \n[Applause] \n",
