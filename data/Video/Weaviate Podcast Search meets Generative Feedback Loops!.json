{"text": "Hey everyone! I recently spoke with Aleksa Gordcic about his vision for the future of video content on YouTube and it really ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching the Wii gay podcast I'm super \nexcited to welcome Alexa gordich Andre \nbondarev Stephanie horvachesky and \ngunjan batarai Jana wellender Greg \nkamrat and Colin Harman email and Finn \nProfessor Laura Dietz Brian Raymond \nErica Cardenas Siva and Roman yushang Wu \nJohn dagdollen both wivier co-founders \nBob Van light and Eddie and dilocker \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nchecking out this update on the Wii VA \npodcast search uh hopefully from the \nintroduction reel you saw that our next \nuh weaving podcast is going to feature \nAlexa gordich Alexa has such an \ninteresting story of beginning as a \nYouTube content creator making deep \ntechnical paper summary videos then \njoining deepmind the top AI lab in the \nworld arguably and then leaving deepmind \nto start ordus so ordus is about \ncreating these next Generation content \ncreator tools so building question \nanswering or chat Bots over particular \nYouTube channels like say Jeremy \nHoward's YouTube channel and ideas like \nthis so this really inspired me to give \nan update on what I've been doing with \nthe wevia podcast search I've been \ntaking these podcasts putting them into \nwhisper and then taking the transcripts \nand you know searching through them and \nnow with large language models and \ngenerative feedback loops I think it's \nright for an update so generative \nfeedback loops broadly the ideas where \nwe retrieve data to pass the large \nlanguage model and then we save the \nresulting Generations from the large \nlanguage model back into our database so \nthere are two really like kind of boots \non the ground immediately useful \napplications of this which is firstly to \nwrite a summary of the podcast and then \nsecondly to identify the chapters in the \npodcast these are just like two tasks \nyou have to do every time you upload a \npodcast as you're managing something \nlike a podcast but at the end of the \nvideo I want to conclude with some I \nthink directions for future work that \ncan really take this to the Moon I think \nthe future of content creation and \nconsumption this kind of you know video \nYouTube podcasting I think all this is \njust you know gonna totally flip on its \nhead with large language models and all \nthis cool exciting stuff so I hope you \nenjoy the video we're going to start \nwith some code and then we're going to \nconclude with some kind of big ideas \nabout where I think this is going so \nthanks so much for watching before \ndiving into it all the code for this \nproject has been open source on GitHub \nwe get slash weavate podcast search all \nthe data the podcast transcript Json \nfiles can be found in this data folder \nthe generative feedback loops folder has \nall these different scripts for writing \nthe clip summaries the auto chapters the \nfull podcast summaries recommendation is \na demo that I did at odsc East where you \nshow ref to VEC through the different \npodcast Clips as well as uh picking \nsearching with the ref to VEC vector and \nthen doing retrieval augmented \ngeneration with the nearest neighbors to \nthe user Vector chat Vector DB Lang \nchain that's from Erica's blog post so \nif you want to chat with this podcast \nthis is how you do that and then some \nother things like how you do a weeviate \nbackup or how you get the data out of \nwevia into a Json with the cursor API \nhow we create the schema which we'll get \ninto right after this and then all sorts \nof things from how you upload the data \nand missing school thing so if you do \ncheck this out please leave a star it \nmeans the world to me and um yeah I \nreally hope you enjoyed this this video \nwill show you how you can apply \ngenerative feedback loops to the weevier \npodcast transcriptions so when we first \npresented generative feedback loops we \nhave the example of Airbnb listings we \nhad a data set that mostly contained \ntabular symbolic features like the \nnumber of bedrooms in the Airbnb listing \nwhat neighborhood it's in the minimum \nnumber of nights you needed to stay in \nand so on and so the first thing we did \nwith generative feedback loops is we \ntook this tabular data and then we put \nit into a prompt that wrote a text \ndescription of the Airbnb listing which \nwe could then vectorize as say the zero \nshot open AI or cohere models and then \nembed into our wevia index to search \nthrough another thing that we did with \ngenerative feedback loops in this first \npresentation was we took these summaries \nand then we wrote a personalized summary \nby retrieving from a user class that had \nsay Connor who likes to travel with his \ndog or Bob who needs a powerlifting gym \nwhen he travels so we showed kind of two \nthings of how you build this index out \nof tabular data by retrieving data from \nthe database feeding it into the \nlanguage model and then saving that \ngeneration back into the database as \nwell as retrieving from another class \nand all those kind of ideas of how we \ntake data from our database put into a \nlanguage model and then you know save \nthe resulting generation because we're \ngoing to want to use it in the future \nso I'm so excited to show you how I've \nbeen using this concept for the weeviate \npodcast search maybe you're working with \na similar data set or maybe this will \njust kind of inspire your thinking on \nwhat generative feedback loops are \ncapable of and the role that this will \nplay in the future of you know \ngenerative models Vector databases and \nall this cool exciting stuff so we're \ngoing to start off with the data schema \nshowing how we design the classes \nproperties cross references for this \nparticular example then we're going to \nbuild a summary index of Clips where we \ntake the raw what was said in the \npodcast and we transform it into a \nsummary of the content that was said and \nthen it's actually better to search \nthrough this summary index the \nvectorized representations of the \nsummaries rather than the vector \nrepresentation of just kind of the raw \ntranscript so we're going to be saving \nthese summaries back into the database \nand then using these summarized Clips to \nfeed into our summarization chain for \nthe entire podcast so it's a nice \nexample of where we save something back \ninto the database then keep feeding it \ninto future chains and this whole idea \nof you know this kind of cascading \nGenerations that we've saved back into \nour database so we're also going to use \nthe clips to do the chapter segmentation \nAuto chapter analysis at the end as well \nso finally after the video with the \nPractical like just the Hands-On \nexamples with that we see the results \nand we've tested things I want to \npresent some future directions so here's \na data schema for the wevia podcast \nsearch we have three classes pod clip \npodcast and chapter highlighted in green \nis the property that's used to vectorize \neach instance of the class so for every \npod clip we have a clip summary a text \nproperty and that's what's passed into \nour vectorizer model that produces the \nvector that will represent each instance \nof the podcast clip similarly for the \nchapters the description that's written \nwill represent the chapter the \ndescription will be vectorized to \nrepresent each individual chapter each \ndescription is vectorized RF is super \nredundant and then with the podcast the \nsummary will be vectorized so also shown \nin red are the data types for each \nproperty so content is text speaker is \ntext pod number is int there's some \ninteresting things you can do when \nyou're indexing a text to use as a \ncategory so for example with speaker we \nmight want to use that as a categorical \nvariable rather than you know like a \ntext thing so so you can configure this \nin weviate to have the inverted index on \nusing speaker as a categorical thing if \nyou want to query like where speaker \nequals Bob inlight or Eddie and dylocker \nor something like this so you can do \nthat with these text properties so \nsimilarly you can do say duration to \nhave like a filter on say you want to \nonly see chapters that are longer than \nfive minutes because you know or blogger \nthan let's say 10 minutes because that's \nmore likely to be I don't know maybe a \ndeep discussion I'm not sure but like \nyou can use these properties to filter \nyour vector search so as you're \nsearching through the vector \nrepresentations of the podcast clip you \ncan also add these uh these filters as \nwell which is something I always found \nwas so interesting about weavate is this \ncombination of filtered Vector index \ntraversal so additionally we have cross \nreferences between classes so the way \nthat this works is you can first search \nfor you know a podcast that matches your \nquery and you can see which Clips are \ncontained in the podcast to then get out \nthe clips or so on you could link \nchapters to pod clips and all sorts of \nother stuff I think there's an \ninteresting discussion to be had about \nrepresenting podcast \nclasses with the summarization Chain \nversus ref devec but first let me show \nyou the example of the summarization \nchain and then we'll come back to that \ndiscussion so I hope this is a good \ndescription of the data schema that's \ngoing to be used for this example now \nlet's see quickly the Json dictionary \nthat you use to create it and weeviate \nso we'll start off with a quick look on \nhow to create these schemas with Wi-Fi \nso the first thing we do is we connect \nthe Wega client wherever wherever this \nis running in my case I'm just running \nit locally on this laptop but you can \nalso have weeviate embedded or say the \nWii VA cloud service running it yourself \nthese kind of things so first you \nconnect to your we get instance and then \nyou define the schema dictionary where \nyou have the different classes that you \nwant to create again we want to create \nthree pod flip podcast chapters so with \nchapters we're going to turn on the text \neffect Transformers to vectorize each \ninstance of our class and then we're \nalso going to enable the generative open \nAI \nto do that thing where we are going to \nparallel I'll get into this more later \nbut we select which model we want to use \nin this case I like the text DaVinci \nzero zero three uh so here's the next \ninteresting thing is we're so we're \ndefining our property so see summary \nversus content in this case we have skip \nfalse this means we're going to \nvectorize the class based on summary \nwhereas content we're going to skip this \nwe're not going to vectorize content \nspeaker we're going to skip as well and \nspeaker I did mention that you can have \nthis you can enable inverted indexing on \ntext properties to use them as \ncategories I haven't done that quite yet \nbut just quickly noting that this is \nwhere you would do that so after you \ndefine all the kind of you know text in \ndate these normal properties now we \nDefine cross references so we have in \npodcast which has the data type podcast \nthat we're about to Define and you have \nin chapter with chapter that we're about \nto Define so I don't think there's \nanything else to novel about this you \nknow podcast again we uh skip the other \nproperties we only vectorize the summary \nuh these are kind of older properties I \nhad when I was originally working on \nthis but um so yeah so has clip has \nchapter chapter you know time start time \nand so on so now that we've defined our \ndata schema we're going to be uploading \nthe data that we do have and keep in \nmind that a lot of this data in the \nschema is going to be produced by an llm \nthat we're then going to save back into \nthe database but we start off by looping \nthrough this original data uh where we \nhave say the content the speaker and the \npodcast number and then we're also going \nto be creating a clip number key that \nwe're going to be using later to get the \nclips out and put it into the file so \nwe're just going to be you know creating \nthese objects creating cross references \nbetween pod clip in podcast podcasts and \npodcast podcast has clip pod clip and \nthat's all we're going to be doing for \nnow and we're going to be creating a lot \nof this data again with our LMS okay so \nnow that we've defined our schema and \nimported data into Eva we're going to be \nsummarizing each of the raw podcast \nclips into a summary and quickly before \nI show you the prompt to use that let's \nhave a look at the final result maybe \njust to wake you up if we've been diving \ninto the code too much so what we're \ndoing is again so for each of these um \neach of the contents we write this \nsummary so we can take a look at how \nwell that um that works uh so in this \nclip we are talking about \num competition and this paper summary so \nConnor shorten agrees that markets are \nunderserved and competition is a big \nforce that can show ideas he gives \ncredit to the speaker for diving into \ngraph neural network stuff so that was a \npretty good summary uh here's another \none or let's see one that maybe has more \ncontent to it \n[Music] \num \nokay so this is Alexa talking about I \nalready felt fairly comfortable uh so \nthis is uh Alex is talking about how he \ngot the deepmind so and the summary is \nAlexa gordage began his journey into \nmachine learning in 2018 when he \nattended a summer camp organized by \nMicrosoft he was inspired by the \nlecturers from deepmind and wanted to be \nat the Forefront of AI development so \nand so on so this also is a pretty good \nuh summary so so basically you get the \nidea of how um you see how these \nsummaries are like you know more \ncompressed information packed than kind \nof you know just raw how people speak \nand I think this is a really interesting \ncomponent of this because you vectorize \nthis to represent the classes and then \nsearch through and it gives you a better \nVector because it's cleaner data so \nwe're kind of using like the large \nlanguage model to clean our data and \nthere's all sorts of interesting things \nthere's an interesting paper on using \nthese to supervise training embedding \nmodels the summary and the original \ncontent as the positives \na lot of interesting stuff to this so \nlet's get into how we do this okay \nhere's the code to write a summary for \neach of the podcast clips and then save \nthe resulting summary back into Eva so \nwe start off by connecting to leviate \nthen we write our prompt to use the Eva \ngenerative search module generate prompt \nplease write a short summary of The \nFollowing podcast clip speaker and then \nwe template in the speaker value podcast \nclip and then we template in the content \nvalue so we select the properties that \nwe want to select from the we gate class \nto put into the uh The Prompt then this \nis something I did I originally had a \nloop but what I found is it costs about \na dollar to do this so if I did it for \nall I think 15 podcasts in there so I'm \njust doing one podcast at a time for the \ndemo so a podcast goes 55 and you know \njust putting it into the wear filter \ntemplate so first we get the total clips \nand again I just kind of hard coded that \nin quickly but so then we get the total \nClips in the podcast now we're going to \nbe looping through the clips with this \noffset so the way that this works is \nbuilt in this generate search module \ninto go language makes it really good at \nhandling the parallel go Lang requests \nwhich makes it really fast but if you \ntry to put in like all 70 Clips at once \nyou're going to end up getting a read \ntimeout if like one of those requests \ntakes too long and so on so I do this 10 \nat a time by using the following where \nyou Loop through the clips with this \nincrement of you know plus 10 step sizes \nand then with limit 10 and then with \noffset so the offset just pushes it you \nknow through the the data objects so um \nyeah so you just grab the podcast clip \nyou subset sample the generate \nproperties then you pass in pass it into \nthe prompt defined above and it's pretty \nmuch as easy as that you get the ID out \nand then this is just what I did to kind \nof monitor how it's going and then you \njust update the data object by creating \nthis new property for each of the \nsummaries with the summary and then the \ngenerate a single result that comes out \nof the prompt you get the ID and then \nyou update the the data object with this \nnew property the class name and then the \nuuid for this object okay so next step \nis to write a summary for the entire \npodcast gas by using a summarization \nchain so firstly again we connect to \nalleviate I will pass in our openai key \nhere because we're going to do this just \nwith the the open AI API here in Python \nbecause we're doing it sequentially \nrather than parallelizing the request \nacross the search results so we just \npass in this is just a little wrapper I \nfound that the I actually prefer the \nresults of DaVinci to 3.5 turbo maybe \nsomeone has a comment but I didn't like \nexplore it that that much so temperature \nof zero passing in the prompt Max tokens \nand all this kind of stuff so so first \nthings first thing to do is to get all \nof the uh the clips and again we want \nthe summaries not the original content \nso we get these clips with our weevier \nquery and then what we're going to do is \nthis local memory create and refine \nprompt so maybe if I or hopefully that's \nuh you can see that well but so we start \noff with an empty string for the current \nsummary and we have the prompt please \nwrite a summary of the following podcast \nyou will receive the clips one at a time \nas well as a summary generated so far \ncurrent summary so far and then we put \nin our local memory that we're going to \nkeep writing by saving the output of \nthis call back into that current summary \nvariable in the next podcast clip \nspeaker percent speaker and then you put \nin the the next clip speaker said \ncontent so We're looping through the \nclips putting in the speaker set content \nas well as our local memory of the \ncurrent summary of the podcast so far \nso hopefully that makes sense so then \nwhat we do is so what would happen with \nthis originally is it would just keep \nadding sentences onto the end of the \nsummary so you know then you end up \ngoing over the 4096 token window so in \nthe middle of this while you're looping \nthrough the clips you then have please \nrewrite the summary to make it shorter \nplease be careful about losing too much \ninformation when rewriting I found that \nthat kind of works that second thing of \nbut because it I think the current \nlimitation of this is that it often will \ncompress it to just writing these long \nlists with commas of each of the things \nand you know that's not great for the \nsummary but so there are some \ninteresting ideas but this is the first \nthing I tested is this kind of \nsummarization chain thing so you just \ncontinue looping through that again \nprinting it just so I can see it as it's \nrunning in the console \nand then saving it so we get the podcast \nID that we want to be linking as we're \nsaving back into the podcast object so \nwe um you know we add this new summary \nuh property and then we update it by \nputting in the summary that comes out of \nthis that current summary object as \nwe've exited the loop and then we pass \nin the ID \nso I think the first thing to note about \nrunning this is about how you're going \nto be visualizing it and maybe there's \nan opportunity for a startup I've heard \nof tools like Lang flow and things like \nthis I just haven't personally had the \ntime to get into it yet but this is what \nI've been doing is just as it's looping \nthrough each podcast clip it takes that \nfirst podcast clip it writes the summary \nof the whole podcast from it then it \nrewrites it and I'm just kind of \nprinting it to the terminal and I'm you \nknow just watching it on the side as it \nruns and so I do think that you get a \npretty good debugging with this like um \nI've learned from just watching this \nthat when you rewrite it often the ways \nthat this fails and the reason why the \nresulting summary is like okay is \nbecause it'll compress it into like a \nlist you know like just like commas to \ndescribe terms and I mean at the end of \nthe future work I want to talk about \nthis kind of General understanding and \nhow it that clearly doesn't understand \nwhat it's talking about really and I \nthink there's a lot of interesting I \nthink that's quite an interesting point \nbut anyway so just the the Practical \nexample I want to show you is just \nlogging it to the terminal to visualize \nthe chain honestly I think this gets the \njob done but I can't imagine with \ncomplex chains and you know when you're \nreally looping and then Branch like each \nLoop has this kind of nested like you \nknow summarize and then rewrite I can \nimagine maybe you want these more \nadvanced tools for visualizing these \nkind of things so now let's get into \nwhat I think is the most interesting \ntask for these generative feedback loops \nto be doing which is to automatically \nidentify the chapters in the podcast \nthis is probably the most useful time \nsaving thing about this to be doing so \nagain we start off with all that same \nkind of connect to evade and Define this \nopen AI thing and there's probably a \ncleaner way of doing this but I don't \nthink it matters for this so again we \nget the podcast Clips out and now we're \ngoing to be looping through these clips \nso here's the interesting thing so we \nstart off with this empty dictionary of \nchapters that we're going to be putting \nin these dictionaries too so we're gonna \nhave a list of dictionaries then at the \nend of the loop we'll Loop through this \nlist and then we'll take out these \ndictionaries to write the key values \ninto into the weva data objects so we \nhave the keys chapter and then start and \nend which is going to be you know huge \nfor how we then use this to annotate the \npodcast and then we have the Pod clip \nIDs to create those cross references \nfrom pod Clips to Chapters and then \ninversely chapter has pod clip so here's \nthe prompt that I found to work okay \nwith this and hopefully I find this \ninteresting so your task is to annotate \nchapters in a podcast you will receive a \npodcast clip in the current chapter \ntopic if the conversation in the clip \ndiscusses the same topic please output 0 \nif the content in the clip is very short \nsuch as a joke or a thank you or \nsomething minor like this please output \n0 however if the conversation in the \nclip discusses a new topic please output \none the current topic is and then you \ntemplate in the current clip that you're \nat \nyou'll receive the current clip as well \nas the previous and next clip for \nadditional reference so previous clip \nnext clip current clip and then so you \nput the current clip again twice as a \nreminder please only output either zero \nor one as described above so I think \nthere are kind of two things to this \nprompt that make it interesting the \nfirst of which is showing how you can \nhave this if else just in natural \nlanguage to have it you know if this \nkind of natural instruction I find that \nto be very interesting and then I think \nthis is the idea behind a structured \noutput parsing there are you know more \nnuanced things you can do like where you \noutput Json dictionaries and then you \nhave like Json dot loads and then you \nparse out the key and things like that \nwhere it would um you know kind of \ngenerate like multiple things with one \ncall but generally I found this to work \nsurprisingly well every time I tried \nthis it did only output 0 or 1 and I \njust you know see how I wrap the \nresponse in an in Typecast so I didn't \nfind that this that it broke it or that \nit said um I don't know like a new top \nlike say it would write a new topic \ninstead of zero or one and not follow \nthe instructions I found that this \nworked pretty well \nso then what you do is if topic response \nequals equals one now you're going to \ncut the ending of the current topic \nappend this dictionary to the chapters \nand now you're going to be creating the \nnew chapter object so you have this um \nplease write an abstract description of \nthe uh conversation topic discussed in \nthe current podcast clip for the sake of \nreference you'll receive the previous \nand next clips as well to help further \ncontextualize I think the abstract \ndescription of the topic so again \npassing in the previous current next \nplease write a maximum six word \ndescription of the conversation topic \ndiscussed in the current clip \nso again we template all this stuff and \nthen we you know save the chat the \noutput into our chapter for the current \ntopic which is what goes into the um the \nuh oh sorry what goes into the current \ntopic template so earlier I misspoke and \nsaid that this was here as well but this \nis actually uh the current topic \nobviously but so anyway so so then we \nexit the loop and now we're going to be \nsaving the new chapter objects so first \nwe get the podcast ID that this was \nsourced from with this query you know \nrun this and then um so then we have the \nuh four chapter in chapters We're \nlooping through that list of \ndictionaries we have our properties that \nwe extract the chapter the start the end \nthen we get a uuid for this chapter ID \nwe create the chapter object and now \nwe're going to link from a pod clip in \nchapter chapter has clip pod clip \nchapter from podcast podcast has chapter \nchapter so that's how we you know again \nconnect that graph full of cross \nreferences to add this structure to our \ndata so that's all we need to uh extract \nthese chapters from our podcast okay so \nwe're similarly gonna just kind of \nvisualize this in the terminal which I \nfound to be a fine solution for this so \nwhat it's doing is it's executing that \nif else if we need to switch the topic \nor not it starts off with building a \nYouTube channel explaining ml Concepts \nthrough videos then it transitions to oh \nstays on that one for a while creating a \nstartup orders \nand so on so so this is the idea of it \nexecuting this if else logic with the \ntopics is it passes in these topics uh \nby looping through each of the clips and \nhaving that if else kind of uh prompting \nthat and then the structured output \nparsing of if zero if one and then how \nthat leads to being able to \nautomatically create these um these \nchapters in the podcast okay so that's \nthe end of the latest update on how far \nI've made it so far with uh summarizing \nthe clips then applying a summarization \nchain on the clip summaries to summarize \nentire podcasts as well as extracting \nchapters from the clip so again it would \nmean the world to me if you check out \nthe GitHub repository that contains all \nthe code for doing all this you just \nneed to replace your openai key but \nmaybe you're probably just more \ninterested in seeing the example and \nthen applying it to whatever data set \nyou're working with so anyway so here \nare some directions I think of what I \nwant to do next with this project that I \nthink are really interesting and I think \nyou'll find that interesting as well so \nstarting off with topic modeling for \npodcast summaries I really want to show \nyou this ad atlas map and I think that \ntopic modeling where you cluster the \nclips and then you look at the Clusters \ncould have a nice structure instead of \nthis kind of sequential summarization \nchain I I don't think the sequential \nsummarization chain is going to be the \nbest way to summarize these podcasts \ngoing forward then I want to talk about \nself-ask prompting we're usually \nthinking about it with question \ndecomposition but I think it's really \ninteresting for summarization as well I \nwant to show an idea that I've been \nlearning about from Lama index on \nretrieving from multiple information \nsources I think there's a lot of nuance \nto this I think I want to talk about \npersonalized summaries podcasted blog \nposts and generally how working on this \nproject has led to a new understanding \nfor me on fine-tuning llms and hopefully \nyou'll agree or have some feedback on \nwhat I'm getting wrong okay so what \nyou're looking at is atlas from nomec AI \nwhich is a visualization of embeddings \nprojected into a lower dimensional space \nso that we can visualize the Clusters \nyou see these high level tags generative \nadversarial networks the neural \narchitecture search topic modeling which \nis funny because that's what we're \ntalking about these are the high level \ndescriptions given to these categories \nso this is a pretty big topic map as you \nsee in the title this is all of the \nabstracts of papers and nerves from 1987 \nto 2022 but you could imagine doing this \nkind of thing so if we zoom in on the \ngenerative adversarial Network thing \nlike imagine all the podcast Clips are \nlike this and they have some kind of \ncluster structure within the clips and \nthen so I think summarizing each of the \nClusters and then just kind of merging \nthem into the one Summer from the \npodcast I think most likely that's the \nbest way to summarize long content with \nthese llms going forward so the first \nthing I want to do next is add in a \nprompt when it's summarizing the podcast \nclip to ask do are do you need more \ninformation more background knowledge \nabout certain terms that you're \nsummarizing so one thing I noticed just \nfrom watching the summarization chain in \nthe terminal is that it doesn't \nunderstand say what graph neural \nnetworks are and so it'll combine the \ngraph neural networks thing into the \ndiscussion of like just creating YouTube \ncontent broadly in a way that totally \ndoesn't make sense demonstrates no \nunderstanding of what graph neural \nnetworks are which brings into the last \nthing on fine-tuning LMS but I think \nthis general idea of we in question \nanswering it makes quite a lot of sense \nwho was the President of the U.S when \nsuperconductivity was discovered you \nknow and then you asked when was \nsuperconductivity discovered and then in \nthat year who was the president so you \nbreak up the question I think \nsummarization change should adopt this \nsame perspective to how that works which \nthen brings me into a super interesting \nthing I've been learning about from Lama \nindex which is about routing queries to \ndifferent information sources so purely \nfrom the vector uh the we gate \nstandpoint I think just the idea of \nselecting from different classes so say \nI have one class this week a blog post \nand other classes like archive and then \nsay another thing is Wikipedia \nand then if I want to retrieve about you \nknow I want to get like a definition of \ngraph neural network say I retrieved \nthat from archive if I want to get some \nuh maybe definition on just like when \nmachine learning was invented maybe I \nget that from Wikipedia but this idea of \nrouting these queries to different \ninformation sources I think this has \nhuge potential in how this kind of \nsummarization chains could improve and \nhow you can retrieve from different \nsources to retrieval augment to \ngeneration pack The Prompt that \nfacilitates a better summary \nthe next topic is quite different but \nthis is more this is more so a bigger uh \nproject that kind of hopefully when I do \ngenerative feedback loops we've a \npodcast search part three I have this \nkind of thing ready where uh what I'm \nreally dreaming of is to do personalized \nsummaries so you give it the chapters \nmaybe a short description of the chapter \nas well then you have something like you \nknow a list of people who are interested \nin the podcast newsletter subscribers so \nyou have the chapters of the podcast and \nyou retrieve Alexa gordich is an \nentrepreneur building ordis or this is \nan interactive way to watch videos learn \nfaster by using question answering \ncapabilities and high quality summaries \nand the prompt is which of these \nchapters do you think would interest \nAlexa if none please output not \ninterested so then you write this \npersonalized summary to email Alexa to \nsay hey do you want to watch this \npodcast but if they're not interested \nthen you know don't spam them don't send \nthem an email for the podcast that they \nwouldn't want to watch so I think this \nis this whole idea of \nyou know this virtuous cycle the \naggregation Theory from Ben Thompson I \nthink this is that thing this you know \npersonalization of content and this is \nyou know this is particularly how I'm \nthinking about using it so hopefully \nthat's useful for you to see like a real \nworld example of how I think this can \nimprove our podcast and our content uh \nso the next thing I think is super \ninteresting is to write blog posts from \nthe podcast and I see kind of two ways \nof why this would be interesting the \nfirst of which is to say like what is \nunique about this podcast so please \nwrite an analysis of what this podcast \nsays uniquely about chapter and then you \nsearch within this podcast to get the \ntop K from this podcast and then you say \nhere are clips from other podcasts to \ncompare this podcast as anything unique \nand then you do the top K from all the \nother podcasts from all podcasts and so \nI think that's quite interesting because \nnow you have this comparison kind of \nthing that you're doing with with the \nsemantic search so I I really love that \nidea then I think another thing is um \nyou know I like to listen to like David \nSinclair and like these kind of like \nbiology things but I I often like I \ndon't really know what they're talking \nabout so I think this kind of like \nretrieving from some information Source \nlike archive to write a background blog \npost so you know when I'm reading about \nlike metabolic pathways or crispr stuff \nlike this where I hardly understand any \nof it having some kind of like \npre-flight blog post for me before I \nlistened to one of these podcasts I \nthink that could be really cool this \nproject transformed my understanding of \nlarge language model fine tuning so I \nthink on one end we're kind of just you \nknow waiting around when is GPT 5 coming \nor when is you know cloud or cohere or \nsome open source model going to just be \nthis impressive model that can just do \nsomehow understand topics like graph \nneural networks like specific things for \nyour specific information needs so it \ngot me thinking about you know you could \nimagine you take the prompts again like \nplease write a summary current summary \nso far and then you know the local \nmemory and then the next clip and the \nnext summary and it outputs some kind of \nnext summary and you would label that as \nI like this or I don't like this and \nthat's the general a labeling framework \nof reinforcement learning from Human \nfeedback that makes this so appealing is \nyou just need to say like it don't like \nit and it can you know do that sequence \nof sequence learning and update the \nlanguage model but I don't think that \nthis will ever get you to that \nunderlying language understanding so on \nthe top is kind of what I think is the \nconventional wisdom that you would take \nsome uh you know some model that's \nalready been trained with reinforce and \nlearning from Human feedback unlike \nGeneral preferences of writing summaries \nof things and then you would just kind \nof try to like steer it in direction of \nyour domain by annotating this kind of \nthing but I think the alternative idea \nis you have a pre-trained language model \nand then you language model some of your \ndata set and then you do the reinforced \nlearning from Human feedback so \nthis is really inspired by my thinking \nthe kind of the the news of the time as \nI'm recording this this uh video is \nMosaic ml being acquired by databricks \nfor 1.3 billion dollars and I just \nrecently recorded a video looking at the \nMPT 30 billion uh language model that \nthey open source and a detail of it that \njust blew my mind was the open sourcing \nof the language model and then the \ninstruction tuning it just really helped \nme separate these ideas and you know \nI've had some conversations with \nJonathan Franco on this podcast where he \ndiscussed um you know convincing \ncompanies to language model their data \nthat's where you predict the next massed \nout token on you know say I just took \nlike all of archive or I filtered it for \ninformation retrieval approximate \nnearest neighbor search like this kind \nof like weevier domain you know just \nlanguage model podcast transcripts blog \nposts and so on I think that then you \nwould have this base Foundation that \nthen you could rlhf onto that so I'm \ncurious what people think of that that's \nmy latest understanding in what LM fine \ntuning might look like and how this \nproject kind of thinking about how might \nget a better result from this kind of \nled me to appreciate that kind of \ncontinued pre-training concept a little \nmore thank you so much for watching this \nlatest update on the wevia podcast \nsearch and applying generative feedback \nloops to this data set to summarize \nClips summarize podcasts and extract \nchapters from podcasts I think that \nthese ideas of personalized summaries \npodcasts to blogs overall just for me at \nleast having a data set helps just \ncement all these kind of ideas and \nground them in some kind of application \nso please subscribe to this YouTube \nchannel and leave a like on the video If \nyou enjoyed it you can check out weviate \nweva.io also it's an open source GitHub \nproject we get slash weavate and also \nplease follow on Twitter at weeviate IO \nthank you again so much for watching \n", "type": "Video", "name": "Weaviate Podcast Search meets Generative Feedback Loops!", "path": "", "link":
