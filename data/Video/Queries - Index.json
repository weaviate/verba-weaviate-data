{"text": "Weaviate Academy Unit 2: Index. \nhi there and welcome back in this unit we'll cover queries in wavyite more specifically we'll talk about different tools from query functions Vector search parameters to filters as well as to talk about how wavier performs these queries behind the scenes now after you're done with the unit you'll have a good idea of how to apply these tools to get the information you need as well as to have a good idea of what's happening when you run these queries we'll show you how to get matching objects from waviate and to aggregate information about groups of objects and we'll also show you different flexible ways in which you can perform Vector searches in webiate we'll cover Vector search parameters called near Vector new object and near text you learn how these methods offer different Pathways to help you find the data you're looking for and how they ultimately work in the same way despite having different inputs and you'll learn about filters which you can use to place limitations on your search for example you learn how to use filters to search for data objects that include particular text or meet numerical ranges you'll also learn how filters can help you to produce page Nation so that you can efficiently relay groups of results to the user throughout this unit you'll also gain insights into the inner workings of leviate like these Vector search parameters and how vv8 uses these filters these insights will not only help you to understand how webiate works but also to help you to use webiate including in later units where we'll be populating our own instances of V8 with data so by the end of this unit you'll have a big complement of tools at your disposal which you can use to find information you want from webiate we'll be using python in this unit so before we begin make sure that you have a Python 3 environment set up with the waviate python client Library installed please also make sure to take a look at the prerequisite unit that I listed below now that we've set the scene let's get started we'll see you in the next section ", "type": "Video", "name": "Queries - Index", "path": "", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk9pDfBhnTI", "timestamp": "", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
