{"text": "Private GPT: https://github.com/hsm207/privateGPT HowTo Search https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search Weaviate ... \nforeign \n[Music] \nair this is this is pretty amazing we've \nbeen going through this every month for \nthe past eight months and we're super \nexcited to have you all you know \nwatching and listening to us so today I \nhave Erica Dan and Zen joining me and we \nare hoping for an amazing episode as \nalways \nso like the usual like um if you like \nthe video whether you're watching it \nlive or you're watching it after uh give \nus a like that always always helps us \nyou know like maybe you put the Vivid \nair on the map more and make it more \nvisible \num also thank you for watching thank you \nfor taking the time and and see that to \nsee the things that we have to share uh \nwith you \num and the cool thing is for those of \nyou that join us live you know come and \nask questions as we go right this is the \nbenefit I think the episode seven was \none of my favorite because there are so \nmany great questions \num that like we run out of time even \nlike there were so many great \ndiscussions that we wanted to get into \nuh so this is great so um yeah so thank \nyou for uh watching and listening to us \nso we have a pretty packed agenda for \ntoday and there's a bunch of topics that \nwe'd want to disc uh discover discuss go \nover in general \num the first one is running llms \nprivately so Zen is very keen on this \ntopic and he has some cool things \nprepared even maybe a small demo maybe \nmaybe slow demo but demo nevertheless \nexactly \num then we will We would like to talk to \nyou about ingesting PDFs to deviate so \nthat's something Erica uh you feel \ndearly about since you published a blog \npost about it yesterday so that should \nbe a good topic \nclose to my heart \nvery close to your heart indeed uh the \ntopic that is close to uh Dan's heart is \nuh with it Forum it's something that we \nare launching today maybe some of you \ndiscover it randomly maybe not uh but we \nare often officially launching it today \nduring this V8 air which is pretty \namazing \num next I'd like to talk to you about \nsomething that I feel dearly and \nsomething close to my heart is some \ndevelopment experience improvements that \nwe're planning around the python client \nso there's a proposal and we need your \nfeedback and the python line is just \ngoing to be the first one that we want \nto do there'll be other ones too uh so \nyeah if this is something that you find \ninteresting definitely bear with us for \nthat \num then we'll have done one more time to \ntalk to us about the new how to search \nsegment in the documentation I think \nthis is pretty awesome this uh \ndefinitely worth uh waiting for and like \nlearning you probably already saw it but \nit's in case you haven't done we'll show \nyou more all about it and then I will \nalso like to talk about reviewed recipes \nso this is something that Erica is \ncooking for us pun intended and so this \nis this is going to be great for sure so \nthat's the intro this is the Canada \nthings we want to do and I will open the \nfloor to Zen who talk to us about \nrunning llms locally all right again \nthanks Sebastian should I share your \nscreen by the way uh no you know that I \nwanted to kind of lay the groundwork so \nabout two weeks ago our team was in um \nin Boston for the open data science \nconference and I think the the first \nmost asked question we got was what are \nvector databases and then immediately \nafter that uh people were interested in \nthis interface of vector databases and \nlarge language models where you could \ngive a large language model not just a \nprompt but a a prompt with retrieve \ndocuments from a vector database \nand there's a lot of people uh that were \ncoming up and they were from Fairly \nlarge companies and they wanted to know \nhow they could run \nlarge language models with Vector \ndatabases privately whether that's on \ntheir own cloud compute whether that's \non-prem that their main concern was they \ndidn't want employees to use a large \nlanguage model with private company data \nand so over the last week since then \nwe've seen a lot of large companies have \nbanned the use of public language models \nwhere you're calling an API sending data \nback and then getting the generated \nresponse \num so this is something that's fairly \nimportant that I think is front and \ncenter for um for a lot of for a lot of \nbig companies so I wanted to talk about \nthis topic uh I'm working on a blog post \naround this as well \nand there's a couple more things that \nare cooking up around this but the main \ndrive here is everyone wants to do this \nidea of retrieval augmented generation \nand that's a fancy word for just saying \nI want to run a vector database with a \nquery and then I want to take the \nretrieve documents from that query so \nlet's say I'm interested in uh the \nrecent uh PGA Golf Tournament \nI want to retrieve documents that are \nrelated to that that are stored in my \nVector database and then I want to say \ntell me who over performed based on uh \nbased on expectations or something like \nthis so it'll read through the \ndocumentation it'll retrieve everything \nthat's PGA related that's the vector \ndatabases job and then it will send that \nwith a prompt to the large language \nmodel \nand \ntypically how we've been doing this is \nby calling it API and then we send the \ndata as well as our prompt to the large \nlanguage model that's uh that's remotely \ndeployed \nand then we get the response back \num the whole conversation was around how \ncould we bring that large language model \nlocally on-prem so that we can run it \nprivately so this entire ecosystem of \nthe vector database the the client side \nthe people the employees that are within \nthe company using the vector database as \nwell as the large language model that's \ngenerating responses as a result of your \nretrieved context \nall of that should be private whether \non-prem or running on uh on your own \nCloud solution \nand so this is a really fascinating \ntopic because now you have to think \nabout you can't take advantage of the uh \nthe huge compute that companies are \noffering when you call an API they they \nhave \noptimized instances clusters to run that \nrun the inference for you and then send \nyou the response back really quickly you \nhave to think about how you run it \nlocally uh you have to set up that \ninfrastructure so I think this might \nonly be relevant for the really big \nplayers who are able to maintain a a \nvery large on-prem cluster where they \ncan actually do inference and model \ntraining and fine-tuning uh locally but \nI wanted to kind of talk about this \nbecause I think people are really \ninterested in it so what we did is \nSebastian if you share my screen now \nso what we did is we created a a quick \ndemo with private GPT which is a which \nis a repository that's uh pretty popular \nand it essentially accomplishes this uh \nthis topic of running a vector database \nas well as running a large language \nmodel privately locally on your on your \nlaptop and that laptop part is fairly \nimportant later on as you'll see so the \nthe actual public repo uh is uh is over \nhere \nyou can have a look at this one so what \nwe did is we forked this and then we got \nit to work with weeviate as a as a \nvector database \nand so you can go through it's it's \npretty straightforward all you have to \ndo is uh spin up a local instance of of \nleviate so through Docker and then you \ncan go and uh ingest your data so here \nwhat I've done is in this particular \ncase I took so Eva is hiring quite a bit \nright now I took I scraped all the job \npostings and I put them into one uh one \ntext file and these are all the postings \nthat are that are live right now and \nwhat the demo does for private GPT it \ngoes through and it chunks it \nautomatically so it'll take 500 \ncharacters and it'll automatically chunk \nit and then there's some repetition so \nit'll repeat it'll include this and \nit'll include another 500 characters \nthis will be one separate document and \nthen you'll have another separate \ndocument so on and so forth \nand then when you run uh so when you run \nprivate GPT so let me figure here if you \ngo here \nuh \nall you need to do is \nlet me exit out of this all you need to \ndo is execute the private gbt python \nscript \nand then it'll uh it'll start up \nso for this for this demo I'm using the \nLlama C plus plus model uh that's that's \navailable publicly and \nthat one it's fairly slow to run on my \non my MacBook this is one of the other \nproblems because everything is running \nlocally on your computer the vector \ndatabase is running on my machine and \nalso the the model is running on my \nmachine right now so technically I could \nrun this demo without any internet \nconnection or anything like that the \nonly reason I'm connected to the \ninternet is because I'm \nI'm talking to you folks \nso you can see here that the vector \nstore is locally deployed you can now \nquery this right so here if you're \ninterested in \num \nwhat uh rules is uh you V8 hiring for \ndoing four things and sending this as a \nquery to the vector database it \nretrieves four documents that are that \nhave the highest uh similarity \nand then it takes those retrieved \ndocuments send them sends them in as \ncontext to llama C plus plus \nand it answers this question using those \nuh using those documents as information \nso it's doing retrieval based question \nanswering which is implemented in Lang \nChain by the way so we could talk a \nlittle bit more about that later on \num but this you see here what's \nhappening this is the problem right I \ncan I could give the entire presentation \nwhile this is going on \num so if you're interested in this \nactually what you should do is you need \nto have an ec2 instance from Amazon and \nthen you can kind of juice up uh the the \nspecs on the computer that you're \nrenting out \nbut with my M1 Mac which is fairly \npowerful it takes a really long time to \ngenerate anything and we can probably \nget through this entire session without \nus seeing tokens that are printed so \nwhat I did is \nin prep for this I ran this beforehand \nso I ran a bunch of questions so I asked \nwhat rules is the core engineering team \nhiring for and then these tokens were \ngenerated one by one and then it also \ntells you the answer is based on these \nSource documents these four Source \ndocuments and then this particular \nquestion that I asked here what roles is \nleviate hiring for \num it tells you everything it also \nactually uh hallucinates a bit here as \nwell so there's more prompt engineering \nthat can go into this \nlike that \nbut we're not really hiring for a \ndeveloper Relations Specialist uh \nactually yeah so it \nyeah and if we do I should probably know \nabout that right \nyes \nit's not it's working I can guarantee \nyou it's just running the inference and \ngenerating the generating the tokens \nwords one by one \ncool I mean and and here here's the \nthing because uh we talk about as well \nand you said that there's already been \nsome improvements to like the the \noriginal private GPT Library uh and it's \njust like a matter of like eat updating \nlike this is an early days thing so the \npower itself that your maybe your laptop \nhas is one issue but like the other \nissue is like there's still early days \nbut the idea is if you for example \ncannot afford to send your sensitive \ninformation outside but still you get \nsomething like you know like a GPT like \nuh request and then generate response \nbased on your own data the future is \nthere right like and we could already \nstart playing with it right so this is \nthis is mind-blowing that you can \nactually do it yourself privately yeah \nfor sure that's definitely where the \nfuture is going \num \ninternally we we've been uh discussing \nhaving more support around this whole \nstack of the vector database as well as \nthe large language model \ndeployed oh there it is okay there it \ngoes all right it's coming up yeah \nyeah so uh we'll uh we'll talk more \nabout this soon around how you can make \nit easier so that you don't have to go \nto external repositories or play around \nwith demos like this you'll be able to \ntake your own uh llms that you've \ntrained or fine-tuned on your own data \nand then very easily connect them uh \nthrough a module to uh to eviate so yeah \nthat's something that's in the works \nthis would be really cool for uh \ncompanies that are in healthcare but \nalso Finance so this reminds me of the \nteam too that participated in the odsc \nhackathon where they're sending \num what was it like the symptoms or what \nthe previous existing conditions of \npatients so it'd be cool if this can \nkind of like help the doctor \num diagnosing but also treating patients \nso this is really cool \nyeah that's yeah I think all the \nregulated Fields where you have to be \ncareful with uh information \num uh this would be very useful for it \nand I think epic is already working with \nuh with companies to implement these \nllms and I can guarantee you they have \nsome sort of clause in their agreement \nwhere the llm has to be deployed locally \non-prem or on their own servers \num yeah \nnice is amazing and like so what are the \nlike do we know anything about like the \nparameters around these llms or like how \nbig are they and yeah so this is uh this \nis a seven billion parameter large \nlanguage model so it's not it's not a \nwhen large language models are concerned \nit's a bit of a mini llm \num and even that it takes a while to run \non my run on my computer so we can \nactually I can actually show you the the \none that's uh \nnumber C plus plus this is the one that \nI'm that I'm running on here \nand so it's a fairly popular open source \nuh version of uh of llama the Llama \nmodel from meta \num the cool thing with this will be that \nwe're going to have new and newer and \nnewer open source models and then \neventually people are going to bring \nthem in fine tune them on their own \nprivate data and then not open source \nthem so that there needs to be support \ngoing forward for this stack of llm \nvector database all on-prem all all \nprivate nothing ever leaves the confines \nof your uh of your of your server and \neven yesterday not yesterday but I think \na couple of days ago I was reading a \npaper over the weekend around \num another open source model \num the paper is called less is more Lima \nand uh that was another open source \nmodel from uh Facebook with 65 billion \nparameters uh and that that tends to \noutperform some of the state-of-the-art \nmodels that we have \num so the field the direction is going \nin I think having this private stack \nwhere everything is uh everything is \nlocally or privately deployed I think is \nfairly important \nnice nice and um we have uh Nikon saying \ngreat you know he definitely enjoyed uh \nyour presentation of on private LMS or \nlike local Ryan LMS locally so uh thanks \nuh \num so yeah and just a quick reminder for \nanyone that arrived a bit late \num feel free to ask questions drop us \nyou know just hi say where you messaging \nus from and uh actually speaking of the \ndevil we have a question so \nlet's see if we can handle it how much \nhow much amount of data used here to \nfine tune this 17 parameter model like \nhow many dogs \nto get standard results \nyeah so I didn't do any fine tuning of \nthis model actually this is purely \npowered through retrieval from a vector \ndatabase and then question answering \nbased on that retrieval as context so \nlet me bring this guy up so you can see \nhere I asked the question what roles is \nleviate hiring for and this is the \ngenerated answer from llama C plus plus \nand it at and it bases this answer off \nof these retrieved four documents right \nso the document that I showed earlier is \njust automatically chunked and you can \nsee here that the answer is based off of \nthese four retrieved documents so \nthere's no fine-tuning here it's purely \nretrieval based generation \nif you had fine-tuned if you take your \nown data and you fine-tune it the answer \nis I can guarantee would be even better \num that's that's another really \ninteresting question maybe we can talk \nabout this in the future where how do \nyou weigh fine-tuning versus retrieval \naugmented generation where you just have \na vector database that you're keeping up \nto date the minute a data point comes in \nyou put it in \num we actually have some content planned \naround that as well so I don't want to \nspoil that but this is a this is another \ntopic that I'm super excited about \nyeah \ncool cool thanks uh for for sharing this \nyep \num got it thanks yeah thank you thank \nyou \num so um and then similarly on the topic \nthat you were just talking like about \nyou know possibly like you load the \ndocuments all the chunking and \neverything I think Erica is walking \nright into this very nicely around like \ningesting \num \nunstructured data and then more \nimportantly around \num PDFs in this case \nwhat a smooth transition thank you very \nnice huh I improvise you could hear that \nyeah so day to day uh data comes in \ndifferent data sources and the main \nquestion is how can you take this data \nand import it into wheat gate um so \nyesterday if you wouldn't mind sharing \nmy screen \nand I wrote this blog post \num adjusting PDFs into webiate and in \nthis demo we are using unstructured \nwhich is an open source company working \nat The Cutting Edge of PDF processing \nand other data sources and then \nextracting the content from these files \nand then uh converting it into a machine \nreadable format so one thing about PDFs \nis like to humans it makes sense but it \nhasn't there hasn't been a case where \nyou know our computers can understand it \nand then extract content from that so \nthat's really what unstructured is doing \num so in this blog post \num we talk about Optical Care character \nrecognition uh process and what this is \nso it converts different types of visual \ndocuments into a machine readable format \nand there are models like layout LM V3 \nand donut and what's special about these \ntwo models is that it leverages both \ntext and visual information by using a \nmultimodal Transformer so it's visually \nlooking at the PDF and then it's \nextracting the content from it \num so what unstructured has maybe I \nshould go on the website is they have \nthese bricks \num yeah so they have three bricks uh for \ndocument pre-processing so partitioning \ncleaning and staging \num so in the demo that shoot remade \num I believe we have a link to it in the \nbio right \num we're using the partition brick to \nextract information from uh to uh \nresearch papers that are publicly \navailable \num so we're using uh or they call it an \nelement \num when you are taking \num so like a title and abstract and an \nintroduction of research papers like the \nstandard structure and they call that \nelements um so what we're doing is \nextracting the content within an element \num so I have a notebook you can follow \nit in the blog posts \num but also I just decided to run it \nmyself just to confirm that it works uh \nso in here we're just connecting to a \nrebate client and we're using open AI \nthat you can use whichever a third-party \nprovider that you'd like and then we are \ndefining our schema so we have the \ndocument and then we have the source \nwhich is the source of the text and then \nwe also have the abstract because we're \nreally just focusing on the abstract \npart and this is where we're going to \nask questions \num so I'm importing just one paper I'm \nusing the partition of brick and now you \ncan see it's successfully extracted the \nabstract so this paper is about house \nprice classification \num this is it the problem with this is \nactually that the paper is in a two \ncolumn format \num so it kind of over ran into the \nintroduction part of it rather than just \nextracting the abstract so there is a \nGitHub issue on actually \num fixing this and improving it so it's \njust giving it a thumbs up \nall right so once we have the abstract \num we're gonna import this into deviate \nand then now we're at the fun part where \nyou can query this uh research paper \nalong with the occurring the abstract so \nthis is just a simple bm25 search where \nwe're extracting or we're finding the \npaper that is related to house prices \nwhich is the paper that we uploaded and \nyou can see that it's citing the source \nof paper too but that's like just a \nsimple example just to see that we \nsuccessfully got it working but the cool \npart is is that now you can use \ngenerative search \num so the prompt is to summarize the \nfollowing academic abstract and a \none-liner for a layperson \num so let's kind of simplify this \nabstract which as you could see \npreviously was extremely long I just \nwant a one-liner like how can I sell \nthis to someone that maybe isn't \nfamiliar with the paper \num so then you can see that using \nmachine learning models trained with \ninstruction and unstructured data it's \nlike it's successfully um summarize the \npaper and of one liner but the main \nissue with this is that it's two columns \nso it kind of grabbed the abstract \neffect along with the introduction so \nit's not completely accurate but uh it \nworks and that's the best part is that \nyou're able to chat with your PDFs and \nthe unstructured also supports \nPowerPoint documents and a whole bunch \nof different kind \num so I'd recommend checking out the \nblog post along with the \ndemo \nand you can see the different kind of \nsources that they support \nguys this is really cool I mean like I I \nguess this is like one of the big \nproblems where \num people have like vast amount of data \nright and information and then sometimes \ntaking it out and then putting into \nVivid that's usually the true like the \nharder part than running a vivid query \noften right and so so I I yeah I do like \nthis that we have like some \nrecommendation and that structure helps \nus with this chunking and setting things \nup even if it you know messes up a \nlittle bit with double columns that's \npart of the game you know that's how we \nlearn and evolve there's also two things \num so there is a GitHub issue on \nsupporting on creating a bb8 brick and \nunstructured \num so you can go to the bottom you can \ngive this a thumbs up oh nice and Connor \ncommented on it but then we also have \nsix thumbs up so that's pretty good \nthey're very uh Community Driven so the \nmore likes one issue has the more likely \nit is to get developed so maybe we \nshould share a link for it uh in the \ndescription later on we could add it \nafter the after the video \num and uh guess what uh Thomas hacker \nthinks he is a great work on the blog \npost amazing use case thanks so much \nand uh Philip is saying hello hi Philip \nquestions \num does it so this is different from the \nOCR application you were talking about \nright technically I could oh it's the \nsame \nit's just like the process of it but \nwhat unstructured has is different \nmodels that have implemented this \num so there's actually a benchmark this \none \num where the task is to uh see how well \nit's extracting the content from PDFs \nand then seeing how well \num it's doing that \num so yeah uh sorry unstructured has uh \ndifferent models that you can use it's \nlike layout on V3 and donut are the best \nperforming models right now with this \nBenchmark so is why I highlighted it \nokay because it uses \nyes okay \num you can see it all in heaven face \nactually \nand they have a great blog post as well \nin OCR okay I see \nit looks like we have a keen contributor \nas well by the way so uh I just wanted \nto give nikuja a shout out you know if \nyou contribute like that would be \namazing That'll be amazing \nmaybe socks t-shirts Anyway said you had \nanother box oh yeah \nis it always the case that regardless of \nwhat type of input file you have whether \nPowerPoint uh whether PDF it's always \nthis OCR module and then it extracts the \ndata \nfrom your input and then it and then it \nputs it into like a Json right is that \nokay I see yep and then also in the \nnotebook from chicory he starts off with \njust the basics which I which I think is \nreally cool so she's using that first \npartition brick extracting the first uh \nso this is like the title and then you \nhave the authors but then it also has \nthe abstract and then what's cool is \nthat you can literally just take this uh \ndata export it and then just Spectra is \nthat import it into repeat so you don't \nhave to do the like end to end kind of \ndemo that I um that's at the end of this \nnotebook but you could just stop here \nand important to be the infect Transit \nso many options okay yeah that's super \ncool because I didn't I didn't know that \nit was all OCR driven they were just \ndoing optical character recognition I \nthought they were actually \nreading the file and extracting the \ncontent and then organizing it based on \nhere's here's the title here's the \nabstract here's paragraph two this one \nbut that's super cool okay yeah that's \nawesome thanks for clarifying \nthings \nyou're muted special \ndamn it uh yes I was just saying that we \ndon't have that many questions and uh \nthat was a test if anyone is paying \nattention to me just kidding \num so um I guess I would recommend \neveryone to read through this blog post \nand uh a little birdie told me that this \nis not the final ingestion of \nunstructured data type blog posts that \nwe will have so there will be more uh \njust uh wink wink uh like uh let us know \num and then I would like to pass on them \nthe the room the microphone to Dan who \nwill talk to us about something that's \nthat we're also very excited about and \nthat's uh with a forum \nhey Dan what can you tell us hey \neveryone good to see you again after uh \nquite a while \nso today we are happy and proud to \nintroduce the vb8 form \nwhich um I've been cooking for a while \nand you can find it at forum.va.io \nI'm going to see a bunch of topics there \num so first let me go a bit over the \nreasons why we have the Forum in the \nfirst place when everybody is on slack \nalready so the biggest problem is that \nslack isn't indexed by search engines \nso if you have a question about vv8 and \nyou search for it on a search engine \nmaybe you're going to find a slack \noverflow post but nothing from Slack \nalso if you want to join slack and check \nout stuff you need to sign up while on \nthe Forum anybody can visit so you can \ngo there right now without having to \ncreate an account \nand slack is great for quick \nconversations asking about um something \nvery easy but conversations tend to get \nlost over time there's lots of messages \nthey are fleeting and our team also has \na hard time keeping tabs on what we've \naddressed and what's still unsolved \nwhile on the Forum you can Mark answers \nas accepted and can easily keep track of \nwhat conversations still need attention \nand then another problem for our team \nand also for you as a user is that when \nyou ask something you want slack you \ndon't know if it's been already asked \nbefore \nbut on the Forum if you type a question \nthe Forum will suggest similar topics so \nactually let me demonstrate that \nthe form engine we use is called this \ncourse \nand since they have a lot of topics I'm \ngoing to try to search for something \nlet's say we want to build a bot that \nlets you search by voice \nso I'm typing that question there and \nyou can see that it already found some \nsimilar topics here and you can maybe \nalready find your answer \nso in that regard this will prevent a \nlot of FAQs \nand maybe you won't even need to ask a \nquestion because already it has been \nanswered \nso let's see how this um works with the \nlonger threads \nif \nif something on the Forum is hotly \ndebated and has a lot of posts like this \nexample here on this course has 300 \nposts \num on slack you need to go for all of \nthose to figure out what the current \nstatus is you need to ask people but the \nForum has a very useful feature called \nsummarize this topic \nand now it reduced everything to only 60 \nor so posts and it also can summarize \nusing AI \nlet me go back to original View \nand this is yeah at its finals going \nthrough 320 something Forum posts and \ntelling you what they're all about \ndoing to click the summarize button ah \nright \nyeah that could be improved I'm not sure \nthat last one is displayed there but \nthere we go \none paragraph summary kind of like \ntalking to a PDF but here it's a very \nlong form thread \nso um we would like to welcome you on \nour forum and to that end we've created \nthis monthly introductions thread \nand would like to get to know you and \nyou can also get to know other users in \nthe community \nbut also a bit more difficult on slack \nbut here everybody has profiles you can \nsee their bio and \nthe link on social media handles and so \non so \nplease join the Forum and uh with love \nfor you to introduce yourself in this \nthread we are going to run it monthly \nhelp new users meet others in the \ncommunity \nalso want to add \nrate and actually it's already a \nquestion \nrequest to deviate I would like to hear \nfeedback from external users on what \nthey think about this Integrations and \nhow they're currently dealing with PDF \ndocuments \nyeah thanks for posting that Erica well \nwe are just launching the forums so we \nare very glad to get more content and \nmore users there \nand I just give you a heart \nthank you \nso am I we have a bunch of categories \nyou can see here in my left sidebar \nmost likely new users will be interested \nin a support category but if you've \nbuilt something we'd love for you to \nShowcase it \nso um shukri \nmention him earlier he also built this \ndemo with fixie \nand we posted about it \nand don't worry too much about where to \npost things the general category is um \ncatch all and we're going to categorize \nit later if it doesn't fit but um you're \nnot sure if it's a question that can \nhave a very specific answer that's best \nasked on stack overflow \nso if there's one best answers like \noverflow is the place for it if there's \nsomething you want to discuss in more \ndetail please post on the Forum and if \nit's something real quick \nfeel free to post on slack and over time \nwe hope to migrate from slot to The \nForum because the Forum is much better \nsuited to become this permanent easy \nresearchable repository of knowledge \nyeah absolutely to your point uh done I \nthink we will be encouraging over time \nmore and more for more people to \nactually come to the Forum to ask \nquestions to get the answers especially \nby the fact that like we see so many \nquestions that have been asked over and \nover again \num and then we basically losing that \nwealth of uh knowledge that's that's in \nthe slack and sometimes you know people \nanswer this question in a really nice \nway and then maybe the next time you \nanswer the question maybe you don't \nupdate the time to give the right answer \nand funny enough like in our in \nengineering Martin who is very active on \nthe slag and answers questions he \nactually has a document with like \nready-made answers for some of their \nquestions would you see Larry's right \nbut he should he shouldn't need to do \nthat I basically now marching can \nprovide like the best possible answer \nonce on the Forum and it should be so \nmuch easier for everyone to find and you \nknow what I also say that like slack is \ngreat for those Communications but it's \nnot so great for finding the info so \nit's not necessarily people's fault that \nthey didn't go and search for if oh has \nsomebody asked this right if the search \nis not so helpful but in this case you \nmay start typing your question and then \nyou have that problem like oh wow like \nthere is uh somebody already you know \nlike answered this so without even \nthinking to search you might be able to \nget a prompt with a with an answer or a \npost so this is pretty awesome and if \nyou give good answers you'll get lots of \nlikes you have this extensive profile \npage with um \nyour top links must reply to and so on \nit's kind of a good way to build \ncredibility in the community \nreputation \nnice yeah and sweet Lana doesn't know it \nyet like our in-house like our head of \ndesign uh but that they may be asking \nher to create like special t-shirts \ndesigns and everything for like the most \nactive members on the Forum and that's \ndefinitely going to be easy for us to to \nsee who should be rewarded by cool \nt-shirt right so should be cool \nnice do I hear any questions from the \naudience or hear or see nothing at the \nmoment uh any final words anyone else \nhere \nyes no \nI love the form looking forward to being \nactive on it this is a \nI think marched was the OG he created \nthe OG Forum in the notebook and then \nand then Dad kind of modernized marches \nfor him so thank you Dad \nvery nice Before Before I Let You Go \nwith the next thing done um look at this \nlike uh we have Thomas who definitely \nneeds a t-shirt \num well Thomas there will be an easy way \nlike a help our community with like \nanswered questions or even comment and \nlike help us make it active \num would definitely appreciate it you \nknow t-shirts can be arranged \nsuper easy to sign up you can use GitHub \nor email password so we hope to see you \nthere \nyeah and there's also I know you told me \ndone earlier that we are working on uh \nlike a Google authentication and then \nfrom what you explained to me if you use \nthe same email for email password us \nyour your Google account then we will be \nable to make that connection right \nthat's right so we're going to add the \nTwitter and Google logins \nand if they refer to your email account \nthat you use for both then you can sign \nup right now with that email and later \nlink your Twitter or Google account \nvery nice thank you for this \npresentation that was really good and \nI'm super excited about the Forum so uh \nhopefully we'll get to see more people \nuh coming over and then using the Forum \nwith us \nhaving said that I'm going to take this \nsegue because I think um I already kind \nof like I'm going to be one of the first \nusers as well for the Forum uh and \nthere's something that like I mentioned \nright at the start that I I find very \nimportant and it's something that I want \nto work on in within the company so we \nwould like to improve how people use our \nclients like especially and I'll be like \nstarting with a python client so I even \ncreated a post on the on the Forum that \nkind of like highlights some of the high \nlevel of like ideas that we wanted to do \nbut but in in general the idea is like \nhey how can we help you maybe with uh \nworking in to begin with python then \nprobably JavaScript typescript next and \nthen all the clients will follow but \nlike how can we help you like in Python \nto like develop your code faster how can \nwe help you build with it faster uh and \nthen kind of like and then I think the \nfirst focus is going to be like how can \nwe help you maybe create and manage the \ncollection it's a complete like do your \nVivid Vector configuration maybe some \ncrowd operations around data how can we \nhelp you make like search to data in an \neasier way so I definitely recommend uh \nchecking out this post uh but uh but I'd \nlike to also walk you through it in \nterms of the some of the ideas that we \nhad and then questions you can drop them \nhere during the uh the podcast here but \nalso you could drop them on the Forum \nlater that would be definitely more very \nvery helpful so \nhere's the first thing that um I kind of \nwant to introduce like the uh the \nconcept of collections so that in \ngeneral like in if you look at the nosql \nworld uh like just like in SQL you have \ntables you know as keyword you have data \ncollections I think in Vivid we used to \ncall them classes but I would like to \nstart calling them Collections and that \nthat might be a little shift at some \npoint \num but the whole idea is that we want to \ncreate this API that's super easy to \nwork with right like so if you wanted to \ncreate a new collection it should be \nsomething as easy as like hey \nclient.collection.create right and then \njust provide a name and that will create \na collection like default configuration \nyou want to say specify which vectorizer \nyou want to use no problem we would like \nto have like this Vector config where \nyou can specify the vectorizer so in \nthis case maybe I want to use open AI or \nit could be hugging face or which or \ncohero whichever other model you want to \nuse and then if the cool thing about \nmaybe using this Vector config is that \nthat it should \nit is like a class right in this case so \nif you start typing in your IDE you will \nstart getting prompts from ideas saying \nlike oh so here are the possible \nparameters that you can pass in maybe \nyou can pass in the name or you can \nspecify which model you want to do etc \netc the other cool thing that I like \nwould like to introduce is what if \ninstead of specifying which properties \nto be vectorized uh when you define the \nproperties what if we could just do it \nas part of the vector configuration so \nyou could say like hey I want to use \ncohere with multilingual model and I \nwant to vectorize the title and \ndescription right so you don't even need \nto think about the data schema but you \ncan actually say like my data might have \nlike 20 different properties but these \nare the two that matter to me and that \ncould be pretty cool in this case and \nthen separately if you do want to \nprovide the data schema itself I would \ncall it like the properties so you could \ncreate like maybe an array of properties \nand then again would have this property \nobject that will give you prompts in \nyour IDE so you could say like okay I \ncould give a name description data type \netc etc and then you could create again \na new collection with this configuration \nit's pretty cool I I think that from me \nreading this should be a lot easier to \nkind of like follow and read your code \nand also like typing all of that will be \nway way easier \num the other thing if if you want to \nlike get information about how is it \nhow's your collection configured uh you \nshould be able to for example go like \nhey I want to go to the collection and \nthat get the configuration for articles \nand then you could for example print \nyour vector config or properties Etc \nor separately uh I mean additional \noptions we could either say dot get \nconfiguration or we could have dot \nconfiguration.get right that'll be some \nsomething that I'd like to hear feedback \nmaybe from the community which approach \nworks or maybe there's a third one that \nwe haven't seen yet \num so it'll be definitely cool to hear \nfrom you \num the other thing is if you wanted if \nyou'd like to update a configuration it \nshould be as straightforward as just \nsaying like hey I want to take \ncollection update configuration and then \nmaybe you can pass the vector config or \nproperties and then and send that update \num you don't want to use a configuration \nanymore sorry a collection more you \nshould be able to just dot collection \ndot delete past the name boom done right \nand then that should be super \nstraightforward to work with \num then the next thing is like around \ndata operations and we have more \nexamples around but I intentionally \ndon't uh we don't have like a \nextensively all the possible examples \nbut if you wanted to operate on the data \nright uh what you should be able to do \nis just say Okay I want to go to \ncollection and get this data object \nwhich is kind of like something that \njust uh creates an object that connects \nyou to this specific collection right so \nso this data object then I can say for \nexample hey I want to go and insert an \nobject with like a full bar right or I \ncould insert a whole bunch of objects so \nyou could actually pass in an array of \nmaybe four objects in one go and look \nhow elegant this this is right like it's \nactually pretty straightforward you have \nthis data and then you just insert \nobjects into it straight away so I hope \nthis is going to be appealing to you \num if you just want to get a bunch of \nobjects \nuh you should be able to do something as \nsimple as oh this should be they should \njust say data but you should say like \ndata.get \nfive objects right or maybe you could \nget the data with a wear filter and then \nagain that that should be \nstraightforward and then updating an \nobject could be something like hey I \nwant to update the data by ID by or uid \nand then you could pass in the uid and \nthe object that you want to update \num dealing an object could be as simple \nas data.delete and then pass in the uid \nOR data.delete and then you pass in the \nwhere filter \nand and then that could kind of that \nwould automatically delete all the \nobjects where the price is greater than \n100. \num should be kind of cool and then for \nsearch I want to have actually a \nseparate post for it but just to what uh \nwith your appetites here uh for for the \nnext meal \num the idea is that we could reuse the \nsame data object and then you could do \nsomething like for semantic search like \nwhat we call at the moment near text \nmaybe we could do something like data \ndot text search then you pass in the \nconcept properties that you want to \nreturn and then the limit so I was like \nsay I want to want only one 10 objects \nso in this case we would be going away \nfrom the the Builder pattern that we do \nat the moment into something that should \nbe more readable and then similarly we \ncould have something like data dot \nimage search or data dot hybrid search \nright and then each of those would have \ntheir own parameters and of course there \nwill be like a more complex one that it \nwould be like a catch-all sort of \napproach \num but yeah like I'll be I'd love to \nhear your feedback about it uh because \nthere's definitely something that I \nwould like to introduce and then we are \nat the moment in the face of uh \nDiscovery around what are the good \noptions what people may may find useful \num and it could be around the syntax but \nalso ability you like to use objects \nlike this right where if you want to \nspecify filter then we should be able to \ntell you that oh when you use filter you \ncould use property operator value the \nthe IDE should be able to help you but \nalso the operator instead of a string \nlike it used to be so far it could be an \nenumerator right so we could pass in an \nenum so you will never get it wrong like \nthe number of times I have to go like oh \nyeah I want to run a wear filter and I \nwas like okay so how how did we call \nlike uh less than right is it less than \nor is it fewer than or what what is the \nterm right is it all lowercase it \nuppercase you don't worry we just have \nlike maybe operator dot right and then \nyou see all the options and I think \nthat's pretty cool so yeah that's me uh \nin terms of this topic \nI love where this is going uh looks like \nsomebody got some inspiration from \nmongodb in some places \nuh maybe maybe yeah like um well worked \na few years so you know it helps \nI'm curious if um well what do you think \nof um portability of code from the \ngraphql syntax because a lot of users \nplay with uh the console to consider \nqueries and then um \nhow easy would it be to copy that query \npaste it into your client and with \nminimal modifications arrive at client \ncode \nyeah I think that that's the thing I'm \ntrying to go away from because just \nbecause we use graphql underneath uh \nfirst of all does it mean that when you \nwrite it your code in python or \nJavaScript that you should be aware that \nthere is graphql underneath so in this \ncase I'm trying to create something for \npython developers that they can think \npython first that's the idea however if \nyou do have your graphql query ready and \nyou just want to you know take it and \nrun it we could for have like a data dot \nrow graphql search right and then in \nthis case you could just pass into the \nraw string that the problem with graphql \nis that you don't get any of the support \nand and type validation on thing when \nwhen you run it directly in python or \nwhen you run it directly in JavaScript \nand just that just becomes very hard \nso uh yes the intention is to actually \npretty much hide the fact that there's \ngraphql on the underneath it's not that \nwe are ashamed of it or nothing at all \nit's just you shouldn't need to worry \nabout it you as a patent developer or \nJavaScript developer all you want to do \nis like I want to delete an object or I \nwant to query and run a you know a \nsimilarity set you shouldn't need to \nworry about how we structure it \nourselves \nright and that also cover the separation \nbetween the rest API and graphql because \ngraphql is read only and the rest API is \nseparate formulations \nyeah exactly right so in In This Moment \nFor example when we have data.delete \nlike you don't need to worry is is a \ngraphql there or is it a rest which one \ndo I call it doesn't matter to you right \nlike you want to call Dot get that's a \nrest call you want to call uh near text \nthat's a graphql usually right so your \nhead was kind of like spinning am I \ndoing this or am I doing that in this \ncase you don't need to worry about it \nthat's our problem if and if one day for \nsome reason we decided to to move away \nfrom graphql completely and have \nsomething else instead \num \nyeah it might be a hint like I'm not \nstating anything just now but there is a \npossibility and we have a question \num is there a plan to add this kind of \nvalidation when using client dot query \ndot raw \num I'm not sure if there's a validation \naround that graphql structure I think \nthat's like a really difficult problem \nuh I don't know \num \nI would have to ask Dirk who's actually \nmostly working with the client \num so the so the raw thing for now I I \nwant to stay away from for now but I \nwant to create something that allows you \nto very quickly write code like um and \nI'm also doing it on a selfish point of \nview like sometimes I go to events and I \nspeak in in front of large audiences and \nI like to you know whip up my IDE and \nkind of like start writing code I want \nto be able to just write super fast code \nuh that that is super easy to read where \nI don't even have to explain what I'm \nwriting people should be able to like \nsee it and understand \noops \nhe's yeah \nyeah this is that last point I wanted to \nI wanted to highlight because it's I \nthink it's super important because right \nnow \num uh what I so coming uh coming from a \nbackground in Python development and \nthis uh right now the proposal is only \nfor the python client but that what we \nwant to do is make the clients feel more \nuh more native to the language that \nthey're written for so if you're a \npython developer you should be able to \nuse the python client and it should \nbehave the way your other python \nlibraries and modules behave so if \nyou're a data scientist that's using \nscikit-learn and all these other uh \npython libraries we want we want the \npython review client to behave similarly \nso you don't have to go out and learn \nsomething outside of your comfort zone \nit should just be it should be second \nnature as a as a python developer to you \nand then \nsame thing for for all the other clients \nand you don't need to worry about Lake \nSebastian said that graphql is actually \nwhat's happening underneath hood or I \nneed to like uh write in strings that \nthat are then easy to turn into graphql \nwe should take care of that on the back \nend and I think that is going to um help \nimprove the developer experience \nsignificantly like the time to writing \nyour first query the time to inserting \nyour first object into Eva I think I'm \nsuper excited about this yeah \nabsolutely excitement \nyeah yeah so I will probably do it in \nlike a small phases too to begin with \nit's not going to be a big change to \nstraight away \num and one thing that about doing things \nlike client dot collection because there \nis no collection namespace at the moment \nso the idea is that we could do it side \nby side so this change is not going to \nbe a breaking change for anyone what you \ndo so far will continue to work \num but then once we figure it out and \nand get approval from the community in \ngeneral we will over time deprecate the \nthe old approach and then use this as a \nnew one but easily for at least six \nmonths you will be able to do both uh \nside by side and I'm sure the new \ndeveloper experience you'll be won over \nby by the new approach and that that's \nnot going to be much of a fight the \nother things that we can also introduce \nis like in python or most languages you \nhave the four in loops uh what if we \ncould have like something like four four \nin data dot iterate right and then in \nthis case we could uh automatically give \nyou a system that you could create an \niterator that uses the cursor API for \nyou and then you could iterate to all of \nyour objects uh with with just like one \nline of code right that would be really \ncool \num I just realized because I'm not sure \nif I answered Thomas's question very \nwell but um by the way like thank you \nfor asking like the question I want to \njust come back to it and I would \ndefinitely take it as as a feedback as a \nchallenge kind of like hey can we \naddress that so just because I didn't \nhave a good answer for it yet that \ndoesn't mean that this question wasn't \nvalid it's absolutely valid uh and we'll \ndefinitely look into it because if there \nis some uh log maybe an opportunity to \nvalidate your raw queries from python \nwhy not maybe we could uh maybe we could \ndo something so we'll give it a go I \njust don't have the answer myself \ncool cool so um yeah let's let's hope to \nto have some help from from the \ncommunity on the Forum I will have like \na nice discussion around the \nunstructured and the clients and then we \ncan make it work \nforeign \ns \num so next one I have done to talk to us \nabout the new how to search pages right \nso done take it away \nI think you still mute it \nhello everyone it's been quite a while \nsince I last spoke to you in the \nmeantime we've launched a bunch of uh \nhow to pages \nwhich we aim to be task oriented \nso the first category is how to search \nand uh here on our documentation site \nyou can start with the search basics \nand it's very pointed examples so how to \nget something directly this is the code \nhow to limit in return objects how to \npaginate and so on \nand for similarity search probably the \nmost often used feature \nyou just have the code \nwith near text \nso these pages are um probably going to \nbecome \nyour first hit when you look for how to \ndo something specific we create \nso far we've covered search almost \nexhaustively last night we published the \ngenerative search \nand a lot of this work has been done by \nmy colleague JP who unfortunately is in \nAustralia and cannot attend the movie \nthere \nand um these days we are working also on \nhow to manage data \nwe have a couple articles here and I'm \nworking on cross references and that \nshould be ready before the end of this \nweek \nso um again we'd like to invite you to \ncheck out the new how to's before that \nwe had the install and configure and now \nwe have managed data and especially in \nsearch \nwhich is probably going to be your most \nreferenced section on our documentation \nyeah I really love the new search how to \nsearch Pages uh honestly it's very \nsimilar to what I was talking about the \npython client uh where at the moment if \nyou want to know like oh how do I do \nbm25 search especially if you're new to \nevade uh you sort of have to go to like \nour reference API to then go to graphql \nand then suddenly like you have to know \nwhere things are well in this case we \njust say like hey you want to run a bm25 \nsearch here's a page here's all you need \nhere's what you need to know \num and then and I think um over time \nthis is going to take over uh a lot of \nthe con content from those reference \nPages like let's face it those reference \napis should be references not where you \ngo and learn everything \nso uh yeah definitely love it and um \nthere'll be quite a few more coming up \nfor sure \nand then also when we have the new apis \nwith the new collections uh I think \nwe'll cover it here too \nErica you unmuted yourself for a brief \nsecond \noh yeah I thought uh we're kind of tight \non time and I want to show the recipes \nreally quick \nyeah let's do it let's do it so um thank \nyou for for uh presenting this uh so \nErica tell us about recipes yeah um so \nthis is also complimenting the work that \nDan and JP have done with \num how to uh so if you don't mind \nsharing my screen this is with \ninspiration from the openai cookbooks uh \nwe're calling it the weeviate recipes so \nwe're chefing it up and the idea is to \ngive you an easy way to take this code \nand then just run it yourself \num so starting off with a similarity \nsearch \num right now it's organized in a way \nwhere each third-party provider has \ntheir own folder but here is just one \nexample of the running similarity search \nwith open AI embedding so first \ninstalling the dependencies \num configuring it so this is where you \nwould put in your openai API key a link \nto your BBA instance and then \nauthorization if you have that set \num this is an example of a schema so the \ndata that I'm used seeing is the same \nexact one that den and JP are using so \nthe Jeopardy questions which is just 10 \nobjects but it just gets the point \nacross and gets you started fairly \nquickly so showing you how to create the \nschema and where you specify the \nvectorizer \num especially I feel like sometimes this \nmight be overlooked you are providing \nyour API key but then when you uh you \nforget to include it in your schema so \nthe goal is for people to just take this \nnotebook and then replicated \num themselves and how to import the data \nand then \num since we're doing similarity search \nI've shared uh three operators that we \nhave in movie for text objects which is \nnear text near object and near Vector so \nyou can literally just copy and paste \nthis and take things out as you need but \nyeah and one thing is like I said each \nprovider has their own so right now I \nhave cohere as well this is a work in \nprogress this will be done by the end of \nthe week but if you you would like to \nsee \nspecific features we can have this \ndiscussion in the Forum \num so I can kind of know which area to \nfocus on next so this week is similarity \nsearch but I can do all types of things \nmaybe next generative search Hybrid \nsearch the list goes on so I'm looking \nforward to feedback on this and thank \nyou said for the emojis that's hilarious \nvery nice yeah I think that the idea is \nthat with those recipes this could be a \nplace where people can come like hey I \nhave like a specific thing in mind I \ndon't necessarily need to read a ton of \ntext explaining what's going on I just \nwant to read go through the code and \nthere'll be like a brief explanations \nand I think that I'll be good and python \nis again we'll start with python but I \ndo already have plans around like uh \nJavaScript typescript examples to also \nshow people like how to do it in the in \nthose worlds yeah it probably shows that \nI have a JavaScript background right so \nI'm biased but obviously in our world \npython is like one of the most used \nlanguages \nthis is amazing I'm super excited \nand um and I guess and we're open to \ncontributions as well if somebody thinks \nthat there's a recipe that we need a \npull request could would be welcome \num so be cool we'll be cool \num here's okay so I have a question that \nis unrelated to anything we're talking \nabout that comes from the audience uh so \nsomebody asked is it possible to group \nby multiple attributes in well I \nassuming \num So my answer is yes it is possible uh \nyeah you could just provide multiple as \npart of it but that could also be a good \nquestion on on the Forum uh so if you \nfind like more people are asking this \nlike uh we could post it there and then \nwe could give you an answer \nunfortunately I can't share links on \nYouTube otherwise I would have pointed \nyou in the right direction uh but uh \nyeah I can definitely say it's possible \nso thank you for the question \nbut yes now we can come back to to the \nrecipe so anyone like uh any any ideas \nanyone on what would you like to cook or \nhelp Erica cook \nbuy multiple properties \nI mean yeah like so it could be like a \ncook recipes around various aggregations \nright \nI think it would also be really cool to \nhave \num like popular Frameworks and then \nrecipes on like for example what I \nshowed earlier with uh with the private \nGPT stuff uh retrieval question \nanswering or retrieval augmented uh \ngeneration how do you how do you use a \nframework like land chain with leviate \nas a vector store to do retrieval \naugmented generation or how do you use \nit to implement Chain of Thought and \nthen like if I wanted to do that for \nmyself I could just start off with the \nrecipe and then \n80 of the work is done and then I could \nmodify small lines of code here or there \nI think that would be super awesome yeah \nI agree \nnice nice \nperfect \num all right in this case unless there \nare any final words \nwho will do the waving things we're like \nwe and uh and thank you all for watching \nthank you for spending this time we \nreally appreciate uh you spending an \nhour with us I hope you enjoyed watching \nuh what would be hard to share there's \nalways so much to share uh and and we \nalready are we already have plans for \nthe next release will bring more people \nI think the next one is going to be \npretty crowded which is making me super \nexcited uh so this is going to be great \nbut until then thank you for your time \nthank you for watching have a great day \nevening morning whatever it is and see \nyou next time bye everybody bye thanks \nthank you \n",
