through this every month forthe past eight months and we're superexcited to have you all you knowwatching and listening to us so today Ihave Erica Dan and Zen joining me and weare hoping for an amazing episode asalwaysso like the usual like um if you likethe video whether you're watching itlive or you're watching it after uh giveus a like that always always helps usyou know like maybe you put the Vividair on the map more and make it morevisibleum also thank you for watching thank youfor taking the time and and see that tosee the things that we have to share uhwith youum and the cool thing is for those ofyou that join us live you know come andask questions as we go right this is thebenefit I think the episode seven wasone of my favorite because there are somany great questionsum that like we run out of time evenlike there were so many greatdiscussions that we wanted to get intouh so this is great so um yeah so thankyou for uh watching and listening to usso we have a pretty packed agenda fortoday and there's a bunch of topics thatwe'd want to disc uh discover discuss goover in generalum the first one is running llmsprivately so Zen is very keen on thistopic and he has some cool thingsprepared even maybe a small demo maybemaybe slow demo but demo neverthelessexactlyum then we will We would like to talk toyou about ingesting PDFs to deviate sothat's something Erica uh you feeldearly about since you published a blogpost about it yesterday so that shouldbe a good topicclose to my heartvery close to your heart indeed uh thetopic that is close to uh Dan's heart isuh with it Forum it's something that weare launching today maybe some of youdiscover it randomly maybe not uh but weare often officially launching it todayduring this V8 air which is prettyamazingum next I'd like to talk to you aboutsomething that I feel dearly andsomething close to my heart is somedevelopment experience improvements thatwe're planning around the python clientso there's a proposal and we need yourfeedback and the python line is justgoing to be the first one that we wantto do there'll be other ones too uh soyeah if this is something that you findinteresting definitely bear with us forthatum then we'll have done one more time totalk to us about the new how to searchsegment in the documentation I thinkthis is pretty awesome this uhdefinitely worth uh waiting for and likelearning you probably already saw it butit's in case you haven't done we'll showyou more all about it and then I willalso like to talk about reviewed recipesso this is something that Erica iscooking for us pun intended and so thisis this is going to be great for sure sothat's the intro this is the Canadathings we want to do and I will open thefloor to Zen who talk to us aboutrunning llms locally all right againthanks Sebastian should I share yourscreen by the way uh no you know that Iwanted to kind of lay the groundwork soabout two weeks ago our team was in umin Boston for the open data scienceconference and I think the the firstmost asked question we got was what arevector databases and then immediatelyafter that uh people were interested inthis interface of vector databases andlarge language models where you couldgive a large language model not just aprompt but a a prompt with retrievedocuments from a vector databaseand there's a lot of people uh that werecoming up and they were from Fairlylarge companies and they wanted to knowhow they could runlarge language models with Vectordatabases privately whether that's ontheir own cloud compute whether that'son-prem that their main concern was theydidn't want employees to use a largelanguage model with private company dataand so over the last week since thenwe've seen a lot of large companies havebanned the use of public language modelswhere you're calling an API sending databack and then getting the generatedresponseum so this is something that's fairlyimportant that I think is front andcenter for um for a lot of for a lot ofbig companies so I wanted to talk aboutthis topic uh I'm working on a blog postaround this as welland there's a couple more things thatare cooking up around this but the maindrive here is everyone wants to do thisidea of retrieval augmented generationand that's a fancy word for just sayingI want to run a vector database with aquery and then I want to take theretrieve documents from that query solet's say I'm interested in uh therecent uh PGA Golf TournamentI want to retrieve documents that arerelated to that that are stored in myVector database and then I want to saytell me who over performed based on uhbased on expectations or something likethis so it'll read through thedocumentation it'll retrieve everythingthat's PGA related that's the vectordatabases job and then it will send thatwith a prompt to the large languagemodelandtypically how we've been doing this isby calling it API and then we send thedata as well as our prompt to the largelanguage model that's uh that's remotelydeployedand then we get the response backum the whole conversation was around howcould we bring that large language modellocally on-prem so that we can run itprivately so this entire ecosystem ofthe vector database the the client sidethe people the employees that are withinthe company using the vector database aswell as the large language model that'sgenerating responses as a result of yourretrieved contextall of that should be private whetheron-prem or running on uh on your ownCloud solutionand so this is a really fascinatingtopic because now you have to thinkabout you can't take advantage of the uhthe huge compute that companies areoffering when you call an API they theyhaveoptimized instances clusters to run thatrun the inference for you and then sendyou the response back really quickly youhave to think about how you run itlocally uh you have to set up thatinfrastructure so I think this mightonly be relevant for the really bigplayers who are able to maintain a avery large on-prem cluster where theycan actually do inference and modeltraining and fine-tuning uh locally butI wanted to kind of talk about thisbecause I think people are reallyinterested in it so what we did isSebastian if you share my screen nowso what we did is we created a a quickdemo with private GPT which is a whichis a repository that's uh pretty popularand it essentially accomplishes this uhthis topic of running a vector databaseas well as running a large languagemodel privately locally on your on yourlaptop and that laptop part is fairlyimportant later on as you'll see so thethe actual public repo uh is uh is overhereyou can have a look at this one so whatwe did is we forked this and then we gotit to work with weeviate as a as avector databaseand so you can go through it's it'spretty straightforward all you have todo is uh spin up a local instance of ofleviate so through Docker and then youcan go and uh ingest your data so herewhat I've done is in this particularcase I took so Eva is hiring quite a bitright now I took I scraped all the jobpostings and I put them into one uh onetext file and these are all the postingsthat are that are live right now andwhat the demo does for private GPT itgoes through and it chunks itautomatically so it'll take 500characters and it'll automatically chunkit and then there's some repetition soit'll repeat it'll include this andit'll include another 500 charactersthis will be one separate document andthen you'll have another separatedocument so on and so forthand then when you run uh so when you runprivate GPT so let me figure here if yougo hereuhall you need to do islet me exit out of this all you need todo is execute the private gbt pythonscriptand then it'll uh it'll start upso for this for this demo I'm using theLlama C plus plus model uh that's that'savailable publicly andthat one it's fairly slow to run on myon my MacBook this is one of the otherproblems because everything is runninglocally on your computer the vectordatabase is running on my machine andalso the the model is running on mymachine right now so technically I couldrun this demo without any internetconnection or anything like that theonly reason I'm connected to theinternet is because I'mI'm talking to you folksso you can see here that the vectorstore is locally deployed you can nowquery this right so here if you'reinterested inumwhat uh rules is uh you V8 hiring fordoing four things and sending this as aquery to the vector database itretrieves four documents that are thathave the highest uh similarityand then it takes those retrieveddocuments send them sends them in ascontext to llama C plus plusand it answers this question using thoseuh using those documents as informationso it's doing retrieval based questionanswering which is implemented in LangChain by the way so we could talk alittle bit more about that later onum but this you see here what'shappening this is the problem right Ican I could give the entire presentationwhile this is going onum so if you're interested in thisactually what you should do is you needto have an ec2 instance from Amazon andthen you can kind of juice up uh the thespecs on the computer that you'rerenting outbut with my M1 Mac which is fairlypowerful it takes a really long time togenerate anything and we can probablyget through this entire session withoutus seeing tokens that are printed sowhat I did isin prep for this I ran this beforehandso I ran a bunch of questions so I askedwhat rules is the core engineering teamhiring for and then these tokens weregenerated one by one and then it alsotells you the answer is based on theseSource documents these four Sourcedocuments and then this particularquestion that I asked here what roles isleviate hiring forum it tells you everything it alsoactually uh hallucinates a bit here aswell so there's more prompt engineeringthat can go into thislike thatbut we're not really hiring for adeveloper Relations Specialist uhactually yeah so ityeah and if we do I should probably knowabout that rightyesit's not it's working I can guaranteeyou it's just running the inference andgenerating the generating the tokenswords one by onecool I mean and and here here's thething because uh we talk about as welland you said that there's already beensome improvements to like the theoriginal private GPT Library uh and it'sjust like a matter of like eat updatinglike this is an early days thing so thepower itself that your maybe your laptophas is one issue but like the otherissue is like there's still early daysbut the idea is if you for examplecannot afford to send your sensitiveinformation outside but still you getsomething like you know like a GPT likeuh request and then generate responsebased on your own data the future isthere right like and we could alreadystart playing with it right so this isthis is mind-blowing that you canactually do it yourself privately yeahfor sure that's definitely where thefuture is goinguminternally we we've been uh discussinghaving more support around this wholestack of the vector database as well asthe large language modeldeployed oh there it is okay there itgoes all right it's coming up yeahyeah so uh we'll uh we'll talk moreabout this soon around how you can makeit easier so that you don't have to goto external repositories or play aroundwith demos like this you'll be able totake your own uh llms that you'vetrained or fine-tuned on your own dataand then very easily connect them uhthrough a module to uh to eviate so yeahthat's something that's in the worksthis would be really cool for uhcompanies that are in healthcare butalso Finance so this reminds me of theteam too that participated in the odschackathon where they're sendingum what was it like the symptoms or whatthe previous existing conditions ofpatients so it'd be cool if this cankind of like help the doctorum diagnosing but also treating patientsso this is really coolyeah that's yeah I think all theregulated Fields where you have to becareful with uh informationum uh this would be very useful for itand I think epic is already working withuh with companies to implement thesellms and I can guarantee you they havesome sort of clause in their agreementwhere the llm has to be deployed locallyon-prem or on their own serversum yeahnice is amazing and like so what are thelike do we know anything about like theparameters around these llms or like howbig are they and yeah so this is uh thisis a seven billion parameter largelanguage model so it's not it's not awhen large language models are concernedit's a bit of a mini llmum and even that it takes a while to runon my run on my computer so we canactually I can actually show you the theone that's uhnumber C plus plus this is the one thatI'm that I'm running on hereand so it's a fairly popular open sourceuh version of uh of llama the Llamamodel from metaum the cool thing with this will be thatwe're going to have new and newer andnewer open source models and theneventually people are going to bringthem in fine tune them on their ownprivate data and then not open sourcethem so that there needs to be supportgoing forward for this stack of llmvector database all on-prem all allprivate nothing ever leaves the confinesof your uh of your of your server andeven yesterday not yesterday but I thinka couple of days ago I was reading apaper over the weekend aroundum another open source modelum the paper is called less is more Limaand uh that was another open sourcemodel from uh Facebook with 65 billionparameters uh and that that tends tooutperform some of the state-of-the-artmodels that we haveum so the field the direction is goingin I think having this private stackwhere everything is uh everything islocally or privately deployed I think isfairly importantnice nice and um we have uh Nikon sayinggreat you know he definitely enjoyed uhyour presentation of on private LMS orlike local Ryan LMS locally so uh thanksuhum so yeah and just a quick reminder foranyone that arrived a bit lateum feel free to ask questions drop usyou know just hi say where you messagingus from and uh actually speaking of thedevil we have a question solet's see if we can handle it how muchhow much amount of data used here tofine tune this 17 parameter model likehow many dogsto get standard resultsyeah so I didn't do any fine tuning ofthis model actually this is purelypowered through retrieval from a vectordatabase and then question answeringbased on that retrieval as context solet me bring this guy up so you can seehere I asked the question what roles isleviate hiring for and this is thegenerated answer from llama C plus plusand it at and it bases this answer offof these retrieved four documents rightso the document that I showed earlier isjust automatically chunked and you cansee here that the answer is based off ofthese four retrieved documents sothere's no fine-tuning here it's purelyretrieval based generationif you had fine-tuned if you take yourown data and you fine-tune it the answeris I can guarantee would be even betterum that's that's another reallyinteresting question maybe we can talkabout this in the future where how doyou weigh fine-tuning versus retrievalaugmented generation where you just havea vector database that you're keeping upto date the minute a data point comes inyou put it inum we actually have some content plannedaround that as well so I don't want tospoil that but this is a this is anothertopic that I'm super excited aboutyeahcool cool thanks uh for for sharing thisyepum got it thanks yeah thank you thankyouum so um and then similarly on the topicthat you were just talking like aboutyou know possibly like you load thedocuments all the chunking andeverything I think Erica is walkingright into this very nicely around likeingestingumunstructured data and then moreimportantly aroundum PDFs in this casewhat a smooth transition thank you verynice huh I improvise you could hear thatyeah so day to day uh data comes indifferent data sources and the mainquestion is how can you take this dataand import it into wheat gate um soyesterday if you wouldn't mind sharingmy screenand I wrote this blog postum adjusting PDFs into webiate and inthis demo we are using unstructuredwhich is an open source company workingat The Cutting Edge of PDF processingand other data sources and thenextracting the content from these filesand then uh converting it into a machinereadable format so one thing about PDFsis like to humans it makes sense but ithasn't there hasn't been a case whereyou know our computers can understand itand then extract content from that sothat's really what unstructured is doingum so in this blog postum we talk about Optical Care characterrecognition uh process and what this isso it converts different types of visualdocuments into a machine readable formatand there are models like layout LM V3and donut and what's special about thesetwo models is that it leverages bothtext and visual information by using amultimodal Transformer so it's visuallylooking at the PDF and then it'sextracting the content from itum so what unstructured has maybe Ishould go on the website is they havethese bricksum yeah so they have three bricks uh fordocument pre-processing so partitioningcleaning and stagingum so in the demo that shoot remadeum I believe we have a link to it in thebio rightum we're using the partition brick toextract information from uh to uhresearch papers that are publiclyavailableum so we're using uh or they call it anelementum when you are takingum so like a title and abstract and anintroduction of research papers like thestandard structure and they call thatelements um so what we're doing isextracting the content within an elementum so I have a notebook you can followit in the blog postsum but also I just decided to run itmyself just to confirm that it works uhso in here we're just connecting to arebate client and we're using open AIthat you can use whichever a third-partyprovider that you'd like and then we aredefining our schema so we have thedocument and then we have the sourcewhich is the source of the text and thenwe also have the abstract because we'rereally just focusing on the abstractpart and this is where we're going toask questionsum so I'm importing just one paper I'musing the partition of brick and now youcan see it's successfully extracted theabstract so this paper is about houseprice classificationum this is it the problem with this isactually that the paper is in a twocolumn formatum so it kind of over ran into theintroduction part of it rather than justextracting the abstract so there is aGitHub issue on actuallyum fixing this and improving it so it'sjust giving it a thumbs upall right so once we have the abstractum we're gonna import this into deviateand then now we're at the fun part whereyou can query this uh research paperalong with the occurring the abstract sothis is just a simple bm25 search wherewe're extracting or we're finding thepaper that is related to house priceswhich is the paper that we uploaded andyou can see that it's citing the sourceof paper too but that's like just asimple example just to see that wesuccessfully got it working but the coolpart is is that now you can usegenerative searchum so the prompt is to summarize thefollowing academic abstract and aone-liner for a laypersonum so let's kind of simplify thisabstract which as you could seepreviously was extremely long I justwant a one-liner like how can I sellthis to someone that maybe isn'tfamiliar with the paperum so then you can see that usingmachine learning models trained withinstruction and unstructured data it'slike it's successfully um summarize thepaper and of one liner but the mainissue with this is that it's two columnsso it kind of grabbed the abstracteffect along with the introduction soit's not completely accurate but uh itworks and that's the best part is thatyou're able to chat with your PDFs andthe unstructured also supportsPowerPoint documents and a whole bunchof different kindum so I'd recommend checking out theblog post along with thedemoand you can see the different kind ofsources that they supportguys this is really cool I mean like I Iguess this is like one of the bigproblems whereum people have like vast amount of dataright and information and then sometimestaking it out and then putting intoVivid that's usually the true like theharder part than running a vivid queryoften right and so so I I yeah I do likethis that we have like somerecommendation and that structure helpsus with this chunking and setting thingsup even if it you know messes up alittle bit with double columns that'spart of the game you know that's how welearn and evolve there's also two thingsum so there is a GitHub issue onsupporting on creating a bb8 brick andunstructuredum so you can go to the bottom you cangive this a thumbs up oh nice and Connorcommented on it but then we also havesix thumbs up so that's pretty goodthey're very uh Community Driven so themore likes one issue has the more likelyit is to get developed so maybe weshould share a link for it uh in thedescription later on we could add itafter the after the videoum and uh guess what uh Thomas hackerthinks he is a great work on the blogpost amazing use case thanks so muchand uh Philip is saying hello hi Philipquestionsum does it so this is different from theOCR application you were talking aboutright technically I could oh it's thesameit's just like the process of it butwhat unstructured has is differentmodels that have implemented thisum so there's actually a benchmark thisoneum where the task is to uh see how wellit's extracting the content from PDFsand then seeing how wellum it's doing thatum so yeah uh sorry unstructured has uhdifferent models that you can use it'slike layout on V3 and donut are the bestperforming models right now with thisBenchmark so is why I highlighted itokay because it usesyes okayum you can see it all in heaven faceactuallyand they have a great blog post as wellin OCR okay I seeit looks like we have a keen contributoras well by the way so uh I just wantedto give nikuja a shout out you know ifyou contribute like that would beamazing That'll be amazingmaybe socks t-shirts Anyway said you hadanother box oh yeahis it always the case that regardless ofwhat type of input file you have whetherPowerPoint uh whether PDF it's alwaysthis OCR module and then it extracts thedatafrom your input and then it and then itputs it into like a Json right is thatokay I see yep and then also in thenotebook from chicory he starts off withjust the basics which I which I think isreally cool so she's using that firstpartition brick extracting the first uhso this is like the title and then youhave the authors but then it also hasthe abstract and then what's cool isthat you can literally just take this uhdata export it and then just Spectra isthat import it into repeat so you don'thave to do the like end to end kind ofdemo that I um that's at the end of thisnotebook but you could just stop hereand important to be the infect Transitso many options okay yeah that's supercool because I didn't I didn't know thatit was all OCR driven they were justdoing optical character recognition Ithought they were actuallyreading the file and extracting thecontent and then organizing it based onhere's here's the title here's theabstract here's paragraph two this onebut that's super cool okay yeah that'sawesome thanks for clarifyingthingsyou're muted specialdamn it uh yes I was just saying that wedon't have that many questions and uhthat was a test if anyone is payingattention to me just kiddingum so um I guess I would recommendeveryone to read through this blog postand uh a little birdie told me that thisis not the final ingestion ofunstructured data type blog posts thatwe will have so there will be more uhjust uh wink wink uh like uh let us knowum and then I would like to pass on themthe the room the microphone to Dan whowill talk to us about something that'sthat we're also very excited about andthat's uh with a forumhey Dan what can you tell us heyeveryone good to see you again after uhquite a whileso today we are happy and proud tointroduce the vb8 formwhich um I've been cooking for a whileand you can find it at forum.va.ioI'm going to see a bunch of topics thereum so first let me go a bit over thereasons why we have the Forum in thefirst place when everybody is on slackalready so the biggest problem is thatslack isn't indexed by search enginesso if you have a question about vv8 andyou search for it on a search enginemaybe you're going to find a slackoverflow post but nothing from Slackalso if you want to join slack and checkout stuff you need to sign up while onthe Forum anybody can visit so you cango there right now without having tocreate an accountand slack is great for quickconversations asking about um somethingvery easy but conversations tend to getlost over time there's lots of messagesthey are fleeting and our team also hasa hard time keeping tabs on what we'veaddressed and what's still unsolvedwhile on the Forum you can Mark answersas accepted and can easily keep track ofwhat conversations still need attentionand then another problem for our teamand also for you as a user is that whenyou ask something you want slack youdon't know if it's been already askedbeforebut on the Forum if you type a questionthe Forum will suggest similar topics soactually let me demonstrate thatthe form engine we use is called thiscourseand since they have a lot of topics I'mgoing to try to search for somethinglet's say we want to build a bot thatlets you search by voiceso I'm typing that question there andyou can see that it already found somesimilar topics here and you can maybealready find your answerso in that regard this will prevent alot of FAQsand maybe you won't even need to ask aquestion because already it has beenansweredso let's see how this um works with thelonger threadsifif something on the Forum is hotlydebated and has a lot of posts like thisexample here on this course has 300postsum on slack you need to go for all ofthose to figure out what the currentstatus is you need to ask people but theForum has a very useful feature calledsummarize this topicand now it reduced everything to only 60or so posts and it also can summarizeusing AIlet me go back to original Viewand this is yeah at its finals goingthrough 320 something Forum posts andtelling you what they're all aboutdoing to click the summarize button ahrightyeah that could be improved I'm not surethat last one is displayed there butthere we goone paragraph summary kind of liketalking to a PDF but here it's a verylong form threadso um we would like to welcome you onour forum and to that end we've createdthis monthly introductions threadand would like to get to know you andyou can also get to know other users inthe communitybut also a bit more difficult on slackbut here everybody has profiles you cansee their bio andthe link on social media handles and soon soplease join the Forum and uh with lovefor you to introduce yourself in thisthread we are going to run it monthlyhelp new users meet others in thecommunityalso want to addrate and actually it's already aquestionrequest to deviate I would like to hearfeedback from external users on whatthey think about this Integrations andhow they're currently dealing with PDFdocumentsyeah thanks for posting that Erica wellwe are just launching the forums so weare very glad to get more content andmore users thereand I just give you a heartthank youso am I we have a bunch of categoriesyou can see here in my left sidebarmost likely new users will be interestedin a support category but if you'vebuilt something we'd love for you toShowcase itso um shukrimention him earlier he also built thisdemo with fixieand we posted about itand don't worry too much about where topost things the general category is umcatch all and we're going to categorizeit later if it doesn't fit but um you'renot sure if it's a question that canhave a very specific answer that's bestasked on stack overflowso if there's one best answers likeoverflow is the place for it if there'ssomething you want to discuss in moredetail please post on the Forum and ifit's something real quickfeel free to post on slack and over timewe hope to migrate from slot to TheForum because the Forum is much bettersuited to become this permanent easyresearchable repository of knowledgeyeah absolutely to your point uh done Ithink we will be encouraging over timemore and more for more people toactually come to the Forum to askquestions to get the answers especiallyby the fact that like we see so manyquestions that have been asked over andover againum and then we basically losing thatwealth of uh knowledge that's that's inthe slack and sometimes you know peopleanswer this question in a really niceway and then maybe the next time youanswer the question maybe you don'tupdate the time to give the right answerand funny enough like in our inengineering Martin who is very active onthe slag and answers questions heactually has a document with likeready-made answers for some of theirquestions would you see Larry's rightbut he should he shouldn't need to dothat I basically now marching canprovide like the best possible answeronce on the Forum and it should be somuch easier for everyone to find and youknow what I also say that like slack isgreat for those Communications but it'snot so great for finding the info soit's not necessarily people's fault thatthey didn't go and search for if oh hassomebody asked this right if the searchis not so helpful but in this case youmay start typing your question and thenyou have that problem like oh wow likethere is uh somebody already you knowlike answered this so without eventhinking to search you might be able toget a prompt with a with an answer or apost so this is pretty awesome and ifyou give good answers you'll get lots oflikes you have this extensive profilepage with umyour top links must reply to and so onit's kind of a good way to buildcredibility in the communityreputationnice yeah and sweet Lana doesn't know ityet like our in-house like our head ofdesign uh but that they may be askingher to create like special t-shirtsdesigns and everything for like the mostactive members on the Forum and that'sdefinitely going to be easy for us to tosee who should be rewarded by coolt-shirt right so should be coolnice do I hear any questions from theaudience or hear or see nothing at themoment uh any final words anyone elsehereyes noI love the form looking forward to beingactive on it this is aI think marched was the OG he createdthe OG Forum in the notebook and thenand then Dad kind of modernized marchesfor him so thank you Dadvery nice Before Before I Let You Gowith the next thing done um look at thislike uh we have Thomas who definitelyneeds a t-shirtum well Thomas there will be an easy waylike a help our community with likeanswered questions or even comment andlike help us make it activeum would definitely appreciate it youknow t-shirts can be arrangedsuper easy to sign up you can use GitHubor email password so we hope to see youthereyeah and there's also I know you told medone earlier that we are working on uhlike a Google authentication and thenfrom what you explained to me if you usethe same email for email password usyour your Google account then we will beable to make that connection rightthat's right so we're going to add theTwitter and Google loginsand if they refer to your email accountthat you use for both then you can signup right now with that email and laterlink your Twitter or Google accountvery nice thank you for thispresentation that was really good andI'm super excited about the Forum so uhhopefully we'll get to see more peopleuh coming over and then using the Forumwith ushaving said that I'm going to take thissegue because I think um I already kindof like I'm going to be one of the firstusers as well for the Forum uh andthere's something that like I mentionedright at the start that I I find veryimportant and it's something that I wantto work on in within the company so wewould like to improve how people use ourclients like especially and I'll be likestarting with a python client so I evencreated a post on the on the Forum thatkind of like highlights some of the highlevel of like ideas that we wanted to dobut but in in general the idea is likehey how can we help you maybe with uhworking in to begin with python thenprobably JavaScript typescript next andthen all the clients will follow butlike how can we help you like in Pythonto like develop your code faster how canwe help you build with it faster uh andthen kind of like and then I think thefirst focus is going to be like how canwe help you maybe create and manage thecollection it's a complete like do yourVivid Vector configuration maybe somecrowd operations around data how can wehelp you make like search to data in aneasier way so I definitely recommend uhchecking out this post uh but uh but I'dlike to also walk you through it interms of the some of the ideas that wehad and then questions you can drop themhere during the uh the podcast here butalso you could drop them on the Forumlater that would be definitely more veryvery helpful sohere's the first thing that um I kind ofwant to introduce like the uh theconcept of collections so that ingeneral like in if you look at the nosqlworld uh like just like in SQL you havetables you know as keyword you have datacollections I think in Vivid we used tocall them classes but I would like tostart calling them Collections and thatthat might be a little shift at somepointum but the whole idea is that we want tocreate this API that's super easy towork with right like so if you wanted tocreate a new collection it should besomething as easy as like heyclient.collection.create right and thenjust provide a name and that will createa collection like default configurationyou want to say specify which vectorizeryou want to use no problem we would liketo have like this Vector config whereyou can specify the vectorizer so inthis case maybe I want to use open AI orit could be hugging face or which orcohero whichever other model you want touse and then if the cool thing aboutmaybe using this Vector config is thatthat it shouldit is like a class right in this case soif you start typing in your IDE you willstart getting prompts from ideas sayinglike oh so here are the possibleparameters that you can pass in maybeyou can pass in the name or you canspecify which model you want to do etcetc the other cool thing that I likewould like to introduce is what ifinstead of specifying which propertiesto be vectorized uh when you define theproperties what if we could just do itas part of the vector configuration soyou could say like hey I want to usecohere with multilingual model and Iwant to vectorize the title anddescription right so you don't even needto think about the data schema but youcan actually say like my data might havelike 20 different properties but theseare the two that matter to me and thatcould be pretty cool in this case andthen separately if you do want toprovide the data schema itself I wouldcall it like the properties so you couldcreate like maybe an array of propertiesand then again would have this propertyobject that will give you prompts inyour IDE so you could say like okay Icould give a name description data typeetc etc and then you could create againa new collection with this configurationit's pretty cool I I think that from mereading this should be a lot easier tokind of like follow and read your codeand also like typing all of that will beway way easierum the other thing if if you want tolike get information about how is ithow's your collection configured uh youshould be able to for example go likehey I want to go to the collection andthat get the configuration for articlesand then you could for example printyour vector config or properties Etcor separately uh I mean additionaloptions we could either say dot getconfiguration or we could have dotconfiguration.get right that'll be somesomething that I'd like to hear feedbackmaybe from the community which approachworks or maybe there's a third one thatwe haven't seen yetum so it'll be definitely cool to hearfrom youum the other thing is if you wanted ifyou'd like to update a configuration itshould be as straightforward as justsaying like hey I want to takecollection update configuration and thenmaybe you can pass the vector config orproperties and then and send that updateum you don't want to use a configurationanymore sorry a collection more youshould be able to just dot collectiondot delete past the name boom done rightand then that should be superstraightforward to work withum then the next thing is like arounddata operations and we have moreexamples around but I intentionallydon't uh we don't have like aextensively all the possible examplesbut if you wanted to operate on the dataright uh what you should be able to dois just say Okay I want to go tocollection and get this data objectwhich is kind of like something thatjust uh creates an object that connectsyou to this specific collection right soso this data object then I can say forexample hey I want to go and insert anobject with like a full bar right or Icould insert a whole bunch of objects soyou could actually pass in an array ofmaybe four objects in one go and lookhow elegant this this is right like it'sactually pretty straightforward you havethis data and then you just insertobjects into it straight away so I hopethis is going to be appealing to youum if you just want to get a bunch ofobjectsuh you should be able to do something assimple as oh this should be they shouldjust say data but you should say likedata.getfive objects right or maybe you couldget the data with a wear filter and thenagain that that should bestraightforward and then updating anobject could be something like hey Iwant to update the data by ID by or uidand then you could pass in the uid andthe object that you want to updateum dealing an object could be as simpleas data.delete and then pass in the uidOR data.delete and then you pass in thewhere filterand and then that could kind of thatwould automatically delete all theobjects where the price is greater than100.um should be kind of cool and then forsearch I want to have actually aseparate post for it but just to what uhwith your appetites here uh for for thenext mealum the idea is that we could reuse thesame data object and then you could dosomething like for semantic search likewhat we call at the moment near textmaybe we could do something like datadot text search then you pass in theconcept properties that you want toreturn and then the limit so I was likesay I want to want only one 10 objectsso in this case we would be going awayfrom the the Builder pattern that we doat the moment into something that shouldbe more readable and then similarly wecould have something like data dotimage search or data dot hybrid searchright and then each of those would havetheir own parameters and of course therewill be like a more complex one that itwould be like a catch-all sort ofapproachum but yeah like I'll be I'd love tohear your feedback about it uh becausethere's definitely something that Iwould like to introduce and then we areat the moment in the face of uhDiscovery around what are the goodoptions what people may may find usefulum and it could be around the syntax butalso ability you like to use objectslike this right where if you want tospecify filter then we should be able totell you that oh when you use filter youcould use property operator value thethe IDE should be able to help you butalso the operator instead of a stringlike it used to be so far it could be anenumerator right so we could pass in anenum so you will never get it wrong likethe number of times I have to go like ohyeah I want to run a wear filter and Iwas like okay so how how did we calllike uh less than right is it less thanor is it fewer than or what what is theterm right is it all lowercase ituppercase you don't worry we just havelike maybe operator dot right and thenyou see all the options and I thinkthat's pretty cool so yeah that's me uhin terms of this topicI love where this is going uh looks likesomebody got some inspiration frommongodb in some placesuh maybe maybe yeah like um well workeda few years so you know it helpsI'm curious if um well what do you thinkof um portability of code from thegraphql syntax because a lot of usersplay with uh the console to considerqueries and then umhow easy would it be to copy that querypaste it into your client and withminimal modifications arrive at clientcodeyeah I think that that's the thing I'mtrying to go away from because justbecause we use graphql underneath uhfirst of all does it mean that when youwrite it your code in python orJavaScript that you should be aware thatthere is graphql underneath so in thiscase I'm trying to create something forpython developers that they can thinkpython first that's the idea however ifyou do have your graphql query ready andyou just want to you know take it andrun it we could for have like a data dotrow graphql search right and then inthis case you could just pass into theraw string that the problem with graphqlis that you don't get any of the supportand and type validation on thing whenwhen you run it directly in python orwhen you run it directly in JavaScriptand just that just becomes very hardso uh yes the intention is to actuallypretty much hide the fact that there'sgraphql on the underneath it's not thatwe are ashamed of it or nothing at allit's just you shouldn't need to worryabout it you as a patent developer orJavaScript developer all you want to dois like I want to delete an object or Iwant to query and run a you know asimilarity set you shouldn't need toworry about how we structure itourselvesright and that also cover the separationbetween the rest API and graphql becausegraphql is read only and the rest API isseparate formulationsyeah exactly right so in In This MomentFor example when we have data.deletelike you don't need to worry is is agraphql there or is it a rest which onedo I call it doesn't matter to you rightlike you want to call Dot get that's arest call you want to call uh near textthat's a graphql usually right so yourhead was kind of like spinning am Idoing this or am I doing that in thiscase you don't need to worry about itthat's our problem if and if one day forsome reason we decided to to move awayfrom graphql completely and havesomething else insteadumyeah it might be a hint like I'm notstating anything just now but there is apossibility and we have a questionum is there a plan to add this kind ofvalidation when using client dot querydot rawum I'm not sure if there's a validationaround that graphql structure I thinkthat's like a really difficult problemuh I don't knowumI would have to ask Dirk who's actuallymostly working with the clientum so the so the raw thing for now I Iwant to stay away from for now but Iwant to create something that allows youto very quickly write code like um andI'm also doing it on a selfish point ofview like sometimes I go to events and Ispeak in in front of large audiences andI like to you know whip up my IDE andkind of like start writing code I wantto be able to just write super fast codeuh that that is super easy to read whereI don't even have to explain what I'mwriting people should be able to likesee it and understandoopshe's yeahyeah this is that last point I wanted toI wanted to highlight because it's Ithink it's super important because rightnowum uh what I so coming uh coming from abackground in Python development andthis uh right now the proposal is onlyfor the python client but that what wewant to do is make the clients feel moreuh more native to the language thatthey're written for so if you're apython developer you should be able touse the python client and it shouldbehave the way your other pythonlibraries and modules behave so ifyou're a data scientist that's usingscikit-learn and all these other uhpython libraries we want we want thepython review client to behave similarlyso you don't have to go out and learnsomething outside of your comfort zoneit should just be it should be secondnature as a as a python developer to youand thensame thing for for all the other clientsand you don't need to worry about LakeSebastian said that graphql is actuallywhat's happening underneath hood or Ineed to like uh write in strings thatthat are then easy to turn into graphqlwe should take care of that on the backend and I think that is going to um helpimprove the developer experiencesignificantly like the time to writingyour first query the time to insertingyour first object into Eva I think I'msuper excited about this yeahabsolutely excitementyeah yeah so I will probably do it inlike a small phases too to begin withit's not going to be a big change tostraight awayum and one thing that about doing thingslike client dot collection because thereis no collection namespace at the momentso the idea is that we could do it sideby side so this change is not going tobe a breaking change for anyone what youdo so far will continue to workum but then once we figure it out andand get approval from the community ingeneral we will over time deprecate thethe old approach and then use this as anew one but easily for at least sixmonths you will be able to do both uhside by side and I'm sure the newdeveloper experience you'll be won overby by the new approach and that that'snot going to be much of a fight theother things that we can also introduceis like in python or most languages youhave the four in loops uh what if wecould have like something like four fourin data dot iterate right and then inthis case we could uh automatically giveyou a system that you could create aniterator that uses the cursor API foryou and then you could iterate to all ofyour objects uh with with just like oneline of code right that would be reallycoolum I just realized because I'm not sureif I answered Thomas's question verywell but um by the way like thank youfor asking like the question I want tojust come back to it and I woulddefinitely take it as as a feedback as achallenge kind of like hey can weaddress that so just because I didn'thave a good answer for it yet thatdoesn't mean that this question wasn'tvalid it's absolutely valid uh and we'lldefinitely look into it because if thereis some uh log maybe an opportunity tovalidate your raw queries from pythonwhy not maybe we could uh maybe we coulddo something so we'll give it a go Ijust don't have the answer myselfcool cool so um yeah let's let's hope toto have some help from from thecommunity on the Forum I will have likea nice discussion around theunstructured and the clients and then wecan make it workforeignsum so next one I have done to talk to usabout the new how to search pages rightso done take it awayI think you still mute ithello everyone it's been quite a whilesince I last spoke to you in themeantime we've launched a bunch of uhhow to pageswhich we aim to be task orientedso the first category is how to searchand uh here on our documentation siteyou can start with the search basicsand it's very pointed examples so how toget something directly this is the codehow to limit in return objects how topaginate and so onand for similarity search probably themost often used featureyou just have the codewith near textso these pages are um probably going tobecomeyour first hit when you look for how todo something specific we createso far we've covered search almostexhaustively last night we published thegenerative searchand a lot of this work has been done bymy colleague JP who unfortunately is inAustralia and cannot attend the moviethereand um these days we are working also onhow to manage datawe have a couple articles here and I'mworking on cross references and thatshould be ready before the end of thisweekso um again we'd like to invite you tocheck out the new how to's before thatwe had the install and configure and nowwe have managed data and especially insearchwhich is probably going to be your mostreferenced section on our documentationyeah I really love the new search how tosearch Pages uh honestly it's verysimilar to what I was talking about thepython client uh where at the moment ifyou want to know like oh how do I dobm25 search especially if you're new toevade uh you sort of have to go to likeour reference API to then go to graphqland then suddenly like you have to knowwhere things are well in this case wejust say like hey you want to run a bm25search here's a page here's all you needhere's what you need to knowum and then and I think um over timethis is going to take over uh a lot ofthe con content from those referencePages like let's face it those referenceapis should be references not where yougo and learn everythingso uh yeah definitely love it and umthere'll be quite a few more coming upfor sureand then also when we have the new apiswith the new collections uh I thinkwe'll cover it here tooErica you unmuted yourself for a briefsecondoh yeah I thought uh we're kind of tighton time and I want to show the recipesreally quickyeah let's do it let's do it so um thankyou for for uh presenting this uh soErica tell us about recipes yeah um sothis is also complimenting the work thatDan and JP have done withum how to uh so if you don't mindsharing my screen this is withinspiration from the openai cookbooks uhwe're calling it the weeviate recipes sowe're chefing it up and the idea is togive you an easy way to take this codeand then just run it yourselfum so starting off with a similaritysearchum right now it's organized in a waywhere each third-party provider hastheir own folder but here is just oneexample of the running similarity searchwith open AI embedding so firstinstalling the dependenciesum configuring it so this is where youwould put in your openai API key a linkto your BBA instance and thenauthorization if you have that setum this is an example of a schema so thedata that I'm used seeing is the sameexact one that den and JP are using sothe Jeopardy questions which is just 10objects but it just gets the pointacross and gets you started fairlyquickly so showing you how to create theschema and where you specify thevectorizerum especially I feel like sometimes thismight be overlooked you are providingyour API key but then when you uh youforget to include it in your schema sothe goal is for people to just take thisnotebook and then replicatedum themselves and how to import the dataand thenum since we're doing similarity searchI've shared uh three operators that wehave in movie for text objects which isnear text near object and near Vector soyou can literally just copy and pastethis and take things out as you need butyeah and one thing is like I said eachprovider has their own so right now Ihave cohere as well this is a work inprogress this will be done by the end ofthe week but if you you would like toseespecific features we can have thisdiscussion in the Forumum so I can kind of know which area tofocus on next so this week is similaritysearch but I can do all types of thingsmaybe next generative search Hybridsearch the list goes on so I'm lookingforward to feedback on this and thankyou said for the emojis that's hilariousvery nice yeah I think that the idea isthat with those recipes this could be aplace where people can come like hey Ihave like a specific thing in mind Idon't necessarily need to read a ton oftext explaining what's going on I justwant to read go through the code andthere'll be like a brief explanationsand I think that I'll be good and pythonis again we'll start with python but Ido already have plans around like uhJavaScript typescript examples to alsoshow people like how to do it in the inthose worlds yeah it probably shows thatI have a JavaScript background right soI'm biased but obviously in our worldpython is like one of the most usedlanguagesthis is amazing I'm super excitedand um and I guess and we're open tocontributions as well if somebody thinksthat there's a recipe that we need apull request could would be welcomeum so be cool we'll be coolum here's okay so I have a question thatis unrelated to anything we're talkingabout that comes from the audience uh sosomebody asked is it possible to groupby multiple attributes in well Iassumingum So my answer is yes it is possible uhyeah you could just provide multiple aspart of it but that could also be a goodquestion on on the Forum uh so if youfind like more people are asking thislike uh we could post it there and thenwe could give you an answerunfortunately I can't share links onYouTube otherwise I would have pointedyou in the right direction uh but uhyeah I can definitely say it's possibleso thank you for the questionbut yes now we can come back to to therecipe so anyone like uh any any ideasanyone on what would you like to cook orhelp Erica cookbuy multiple propertiesI mean yeah like so it could be like acook recipes around various aggregationsrightI think it would also be really cool tohaveum like popular Frameworks and thenrecipes on like for example what Ishowed earlier with uh with the privateGPT stuff uh retrieval questionanswering or retrieval augmented uhgeneration how do you how do you use aframework like land chain with leviateas a vector store to do retrievalaugmented generation or how do you useit to implement Chain of Thought andthen like if I wanted to do that formyself I could just start off with therecipe and then80 of the work is done and then I couldmodify small lines of code here or thereI think that would be super awesome yeahI agreenice niceperfectum all right in this case unless thereare any final wordswho will do the waving things we're likewe and uh and thank you all for watchingthank you for spending this time wereally appreciate uh you spending anhour with us I hope you enjoyed watchinguh what would be hard to share there'salways so much to share uh and and wealready are we already have plans forthe next release will bring more peopleI think the next one is going to bepretty crowded which is making me superexcited uh so this is going to be greatbut until then thank you for your timethank you for watching have a great dayevening morning whatever it is and seeyou next time bye everybody bye
