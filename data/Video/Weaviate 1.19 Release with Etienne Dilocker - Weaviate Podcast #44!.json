{"text": "Hey everyone! Thank you so much for watching the Weaviate 1.19 release podcast! We have all sorts of cool new features, ... \nhey everyone thank you so much for \nwatching another wevia release podcast \nreleasing we've made 1.19 we have all \nsorts of exciting new features but \nbefore diving into the into any of the \nfeatures edian has on what I think is \nthe best iteration of the Wii V8 shirt \nuh so Eddie thank you so much for \njoining the 1.19 podcast \nthanks for having me I'm calling this \nthe 1.19 shirt I think it's not the the \n19th iteration yet but it fits perfectly \nwith all the cool stuff that we have in \nthe new release \nyeah awesome I remember we joked about \nhaving like a t-shirt for all the blog \nposts the blog cards as philana makes \nand yeah yeah I really like the book of \nit uh so super cool so let's kick it off \nwith the grpc API and the story around \nwhat led to that \nyeah uh grpc API was sort of an \ninitially unplanned feature but we \nwanted to add a VBA to a n benchmarks \nand in a n benchmarks we've we've talked \nin in the past we've talked about the \nsort of Library versus database split \nand in a n benchmarks you have all these \nlibraries and um but now also a couple \nof databases so we thought like okay \nyeah we have nothing to handle it let's \nlet's get VIVA in there as well and uh \nwhat you can see in those those uh \nbenchmarks is that especially for their \nso so for those of you who don't have \nthe context in The Benchmark essentially \nyou have a graph that on one axis shows \nyou the the recall and then the other \nlatency and with any a n algorithm \nespecially with hsw but with any it's \nalways a trade-off between recall and \nlatency or throughput as sort of a as \nthe inverse latency basically so \nthroughput in the A and benchmarks is \nactually estimated because it's not \nreally a throughput benchmark it really \njust a single threaded individual \nqueries and then if a query takes let's \nsay a hundred milliseconds then the \nthroughput would be considered 10 per \nsecond so just one second divided by by \nthe individual latency the the actual \nladies these are way lower than 100 \nmilliseconds but that's that's kind of \nthe The Benchmark setup \nand what you can see in those sort of \nlow recall settings of course the \nlatencies go go down quite a bit but \nthat also means that everything that you \nhave as constant overhead so let's say a \nvector surge takes for example half a \nmillisecond but you have a constant \noverhead of half a millisecond and all \nof a sudden in these low recall \nsituations you now have 50 overhead or \ndepending on how you see it 100 overhead \nand that's not great in benchmarks so um \nwe thought well what can we do here and \nand can we do something that doesn't \njust optimize for benchmarks because \nthat's kind of well I don't want to say \nit's pointless because in the end \nbenchmarks are a great signal for users \nand they help them sort of decide but \nalso to some degree if you over optimize \nfor benchmarks you always have to ask \nyourself like what benefit does the \nactual end user have and we looked at \nthe grpc API in um adding grpc API sort \nof in the background for some of the \nclients so what is super important for \nus was to make sure that there are no \nbreaking changes or that users would \nhave to sort of start changing their \ntheir usage patterns or would have to \nlearn something new no we've sort of \nslowly started adding this this grpc API \nwhich some endpoints not all yet but \nsome can run with this and the python \nclient for example can automatically \ndiscover if grpc is enabled it's also an \noptional package on the on the client \nside so if you don't have trpc installed \nthen you don't have to install it if you \ndon't like it but if it's there it's \nit's used in the background and that \nallows you to to yeah basically have \nmore efficient queries where just the \nthe overhead and of course that overhead \nbefore I think it was was around 500 to \n600 microseconds so it's a bit more than \nhalf a millisecond that was there in \nevery request but the the shorter the \nrequest duration is the more noticeable \nis the overhead You could argue that a \nuser would never notice in real life and \nthat you only only argue it in that you \nwould only uh notice it in benchmarks \nbut nevertheless overhead is there and \noverhead is gone so making something \nmore efficient is never a bad idea I \nthink even if if you could argue that \nthat most users might not see the the \nreal life impact \nyeah um so definitely want to dive a \nlittle over a couple more questions \nabout how these a n benchmarks and the \nrecall latency but um maybe just super \nquickly so grpc graphql HTTP uh could \nyou just quickly give me the difference \nyeah uh so so interestingly grpc \nactually isn't a separate protocol it \nruns over HTTP 2. so from a sort of \nthese are all sort of one layer higher \nthan the TCP stack they all run over TCP \nand then grpc basically runs uh via HTTP \nuh so the the the way and this is a very \ninteresting because I think some people \nuh just assume that grpc is faster \nbecause it's a faster protocol but it's \nactually not a faster protocol because \nit's the same protocol as HTTP and by \nthe way graphql this is also typically \nsent over over HTTP \num it's simply that \ngrpc uses the protobuf protocol which is \nvery very close to how uh the the data \ntypes are represented in their \nrespective languages so uh the the go \nmemory model is very similar basically \nto to the protobuf structure and then \nalso the memory model in Python so if \nyou have this sort of network request \ngoal which is vv8 wb8 server uh via a \ngrpc to python they're simply way less \nsort of decoding encoding restructuring \nand not restructuring but so re-encoding \nthat you need to do whereas uh both \ngraphql and and uh rest that we \ntypically use for for HTTP \num use Json and Json basically is a is a \nsort of space inefficient protocol \nbecause it's just everything text and it \nneeds to be parsed it needs to be sort \nof the same way that that if if you as a \nhuman right Json you have the curly \nbraces and you have the quotes and then \nyou have the colon then you know okay \nthis is the key value mapping in the \nsame way the server and the client for \nthat matter have to parse that and that \nthat simply costs time and it's it's not \na massive overhead but in a benchmark \nscenario where you don't have a lot of \ntime like even that can can \num show up what was important for us was \nto to like not not add new overhead for \nthe user like cognitive overhead we're \nreducing computational overhead but \ndon't want to add a usage overhead \num so you probably won't notice you will \nstill be able to use graphql especially \nfor for sort of just learning the vb8 \nAPI just discovering it playing around \nwith it the graphql console this is an \namazing tool but at the same time if you \nrun your use case in production and you \nrun it through the language interface \nthat is or clients anyway you might not \nneed graphql anymore so it's kind of a \nmore more options \nyeah super cool so stepping into the A \nand then benchmarks a little bit I \nremember you'd published that amazing a \nm benchmarks collection and we also had \na podcast on that I think it's like \nnumber seven earlier podcast and I think \nwe're on like 47 47 or something but um \nwow I'm sorry I remember the um so like \nthe hyper parameters of you know the \neffect of ef ef construction Max \nconnections um so are all those fixed \nand then each of these you know a n \nproviders all have to adhere to the same \nhyper parameters and the same machine as \nthat sort of a like a fixed hyper \nparameter of the hsw kind of \nuh no actually so the machine is fixed \nyes and not even just the machine there \nthere's actually a so I I said that the \nin benchmarks was single threaded before \nit's actually not entirely true they're \nlimited to one CPU which basically is \nnot the same as single threaded you can \nrun multiple threats with that CPU but \nthere's no benefit because you can't \never exceed more than than one CPU so \nthat is one one restriction uh one \nrestriction is the build time so I think \nif it times out after I think I think \ntwo hours is the limit or so so you \ncan't run anything that takes more than \nthan two hours but other than that it's \ncompletely free so you can set your own \nparameters I think all the hnsw based \nimplementations do have the same \nparameter set so it's typically it's \nbasically a grid search over over all \nparameters so you have if constructions \nfrom very low to very high you have EF \nfrom very low to very high and same for \nfor Max connections and and since the \nhnsw algorithm sort of works the same I \nguess in a sense you're just comparing \nthe the implementations and that also \nmeans that the the parameters typically \nperform the same so so maybe in in \nabsolute terms like one solution would \nbe slower than another but still for \nboth Solutions like uh setting eight \nconnections would probably have the same \neffect on both Solutions as opposed to \nsetting like 64 connections \num and then in a and benchmarks it's not \nlimited to hsw based algorithms so for \nfor those so so for example a PG Vector \nis in there the new uh postgres plugin \nwhich I think is IVF based or something \nor iufpq base so it has completely \ndifferent parameters but that's the nice \nthing about a n algorithms you can \ncompare them them still and and sort of \nyeah you're kind of kind of free to use \nall your parameters to get the best out \nof all parameters under the Restriction \nthat you still need to be able to build \nit within two hours on a single CPU \nso so what scale is the test is it like \nthe sift uh the sift one million vectors \nor like \nuh yeah we have sift one one m in there \nI think we have I forget the name but I \nthink it's a deep one B which is not a \nbillion that that would be that would be \na bit large but I think it's 10 million \nor so so they're they're definitely \nsmaller and larger but I think they're \nall within within yeah into one one to \nten million do you think maybe that's \nsomething that the benchmarks uh like \nshould aspire to is or you know just \nlike the continued scale anyway yeah so \nthe whole topic is so interesting um so \nso maybe pivoting topics a bit we also \nhave in our uh release the uh \ndegenerative cohere module and so I'm \nreally excited to talk about this \nbecause this is actually the first \nmodule I've ever worked on at webiate \nand I mean it was pretty easy to the the \nthe infrastructure that's been in place \nto uh extend these modules with new \nmodels or new external model providers \nso you know open AI Co here when the \nanthropic Cloud Model comes in the hug \nand face Transformers gbt for all the \nllamas like all these large language \nmodel providers can be integrated so \neasily into eviate and so yes I wanted \nto maybe ask you anything about um your \nlatest thinking on the large language \nmodel stuff and that kind of um \nthe the trends and all these new models \nthat are coming out \nyeah cool so first of all I'm really \nhappy to hear that this was easy to do \nbecause this is this is kind of the \npoint of the module system like there \nare so many sort of complex tasks within \nthe database both on the the victory \nmixing side but also on the just sort of \nold school database indexing site so so \nhaving that sort of almost sandbox scope \nof the module where it's very easy to \nintegrate something new that's that's \nthat's always awesome and and um we're \nalways awesome to hear that it actually \nworks like this as as it is intended \num which serves a nice nice segue into \neverything that's happening right now \nbecause \num we're really in this this sort of \ncrazy mode of something new popping up \nand and breaking GitHub Star Records \nwithin a couple of days or something it \nhas more than everything out there and I \nlove that we're able to to integrate \nthem I I was about to say react but I \nthink react is not the right reward I \nthink we're able to integrate them very \nquickly as they pop up because it's not \nreact would imply that we somehow like \nhave to chase them but it's not the case \nit's just enabling users they did \nThere's Something New comes up a new be \nit a new model a new integration \nsomething that provides value in in this \nAI space and if it provides value then \nthere's a good chance that it can also \nprovide value to deviate users and I \nthink being able to to quickly adapt \nthere and quickly integrate those is is \nsuper valuable for our users and \nsimilarly \num having vv8 basically as the the \nstable API for them I think is also \nsuper cool because if you if you \nmanually let's say you're using \ngenerative open AI so the completion \nendpoints from openai and now you want \nto maybe test that against the cohere \nendpoint and then yeah I just want to \nsee like okay what what performs better \nfor my specific workload if you were to \nintegrate with those two providers \nseparately you would probably have to \nadjust some code because you wrote \nsomething that was meant to contact the \nthe open AI API and now the the cohere \nAPI I haven't looked at them but I'd be \nsurprised if they were identical it \nprobably is some difference but if you \nuse vv8 with all of that the VBA API is \nthe same all you have to change is the \nmodel or change some string somewhere in \nthe model that's essentially just \nconfiguration and that goes for for way \nmore of these things like if you this is \njust one example you could say you could \nargue like yeah okay changing changing \none of those requests is easy but now if \nyou combine that maybe with with the \ngenerative search which typically is the \nthe retrieval step and then the the \ngenerative part what if you want to \nchange something on the on the retrieval \nside you could have text back open AI \ntext to back cohere text effect \nTransformers contextenary uh uh text \nhugging phase for any hugging phase \nmodel probably new ones that that have \nbeen released during during the \nrecording of This podcast so um you can \ncombine all of these all of these five \nor however many it was you can combine \nbind them in a hybrid search with bm25 \nso so now we have this like large Matrix \nof different options and you can do this \nwithin rebate by simply changing \nconfigurations I think that's that's a \nnice addition additional value of having \nthat collection of of different model \nproviders within mediate yeah I think \nthat um like they're kind of like model \ninference orchestration of leviate is so \nfascinating to me like whether you want \nto manage this on the database side or \non the client side and I think by doing \nit in the database you just have kind of \none thing with all this infrastructure \nand and yeah the whole thing is so \nexciting the \nhead of the one paper I really liked \nthat came out recently is hugging GPT \nwhere it's kind of about the you know \nthe large language model is like the \ntask decomposer that routes it to the \nmodels with descriptions of the models \nand I mean the the future of like we \noriginally talked about this pipe API \nwhich is kind of like a dag of \ncomputation flow like retrieve retrieve \nrank read but now we're seeing such a \ndynamic uh kind of chaining of the \nthings you can do with search interfaces \nand it's so interesting so the next \ntopic is another innovation in search \nthat I think is extremely exciting so \nmuch potential with this idea which is \nGroup by arbitrary property and yeah can \nyou explain how maybe with the document \npassage example I think would be the \nbest like \nyeah yeah this this feature this was \nbasically a a request from one of our \ncommercial users but when they requested \nit we we kind of almost expect this \nalready because it's just something that \nthat is an Ever sort of growing problem \nthat we now have a solution for so the \nidea is if you have your documents split \ninto some kind of sorry not to document \nyour your entire content split into some \nkind of hierarchy \num typically you're you're either forced \nto give up the hierarchy or you have to \ndo some kind of work around so so what I \nmean is for example let's say you have \ndocuments and you have passages and a \ndocument is sort of a grouping of a \nnumber of passages if this is a very \nsmall grouping you could for example do \nthe ref tvec so you could have them in \nthis as two bv-8 classes you can do the \nref Tech and then reftube gets the mean \nembedding of those passages the problem \nwith this is as the number of passages \nper document grows it gets harder and \nharder to represent so much information \nbecause essentially all gets combined \ninto a single vector and there's only so \nmuch information that a single Vector \ncan can hold so if you try to combine a \nthousand passengers and and these all \nhave maybe diverse topics so some that \nsays maybe not document passages maybe \nbook and chapter or book and passage \nthen it's very very hard to keep that \nmeaning so what users typically do is \nthey would want to search uh buy the the \nsort of smallest unit which in this case \nwould be the the passage but then the \nproblem is well how do I get back to my \nassociation off of the document like now \nI'm searching for passages uh maybe the \ntop 10 passages are all of the same \ndocument maybe in the top 10 passages \nit's 10 different documents and what our \nusers were missing is basically a simple \nway to to sort of keep that kind of \nAssociation and and make make that part \nof the ranking basically and with the \ngroup by feature \num and it's and a group by by any \narbitrary property I think it's it's \nmost interesting for this particular \nexample to group by the the reference \nprop that that would be the the \nassociation from passage to document it \nnow allows you to have \nbasically the first hit comes in and \nlet's say it's off document one \num then you can you can group all the \npassages that match that same document \nin one group and then you can either \nsort of group this by what is the the \nhighest similarity per group or you \ncould take the mean similarity per per \ngroup or something there's like more \nmore options but basically if you want \nto display like if you want to search \nthrough passages but to your users want \nto display \num uh documents you can do this now \nbecause by finding the the \nthe one passage that fits the best you \nstill get the the latest passages \nbasically the the most related passages \nin that same document that you can \nrepresent to your users so it gives you \nlike a nice way to to display that as \nlike almost like a like a tree kind of \nway \num or various other ways I think gives \nyou more options to to show that to your \nusers yeah that's amazing I mean um \nfirstly quick shout out I was just at \nthe um the haystack search and relevancy \ncon a conference that I open source \nconnections I know they would love this \ntopic um yeah so like with the ref devec \nyeah you try to aggregate all the \npassages and averaging is maybe too much \nof a compression I used to think that \nmaybe a graph neural network could \naggregate those vectors and or maybe \ncluster some ideas like this it also \nkind of reminds me of like multi-vector \nrepresentation where you you know you \nhave a document and then passage that \nkind of thing maybe like title passage \nand so on author \nbut yeah that's um it like I I like the \nanalogy of the podcast like taking these \npodcasts and then um you know putting \nthe transcriptions in and you know you \nhave all the chunks and you have the \nsimilarity the chunks that you aggregate \nit's such an interesting innovation in \nSearch and I like to call this like top \nlevel indexes and yeah I'm so excited to \nsee how this uh evolves so so now \ntransitioning into uh some new data oh \nyeah unless you want to stay on that no \nno just as I I love your example about \nthe podcast and I just have to think \nbecause we opened with the topic of \nbenchmarks and we also have a dedicated \nepisode on on benchmarks I think that \nwould be a great example because now it \ngives you the ability like do you want \nmaybe that snippet from today's podcast \nwhich is very relevant to to benchmarks \nbut the podcast is not about benchmarks \nor do you want more of the mean \nsimilarity where you have dedicated \nepisode about benchmarks where maybe no \nsnippet fits as good as today's snippet \nbut overall you have the the podcast \nthat fits the topic better and I think \nthis is something you can very nicely \nrepresent with with uh the new grouping \nfeature yeah amazing that's a perfect \nexample yeah okay is the one passage \nMasters it enormously but then the whole \ncollection yeah awesome stuff so \num so okay so coming into the um the \ndatabase stuff and I think this is so \ninteresting how um so now you have a \ntunable option between whether you want \nto use the bitmap index which I assume \nto be like a super fast inverted index \nbecause of how the underlying data \nstructure is implemented and then you \nalso have the um \nthe bm25 score index uh so so what goes \ninto kind of this tunable indexing \nyeah so in the past we kind of made an \nassumption that if it's text you would \nalways want to do a full text search and \nthat that just I mean that may be true \nin some cases but it wasn't it wasn't \ngranular enough because exactly as you \nsay we've introduced in in the previous \nrelease we've introduced those bitmap \nfilters and everything so so we had it \nfor everything except text props for for \nthis particular reason and \num everything else is super fast now but \ntext still kind of like was sort of \nstill the old implementation because \ntext was built in a way to be indexed \nfor for bm25 which is or without going \ninto into too much uh detail but it's \nvery different because you need a lot \nmore information so for bm25 every hit \nand every Association needs to be scored \nso you need to know uh the the \nfrequencies and all these kind of \nadditional additional things that you \ndon't need to know for for Pure \nfiltering but now if your use case is to \nSimply filter and nothing else on text \non something that happened happens to be \ntext \num yeah right now you get options you \ncan either index it only for filters \nthen it's fast it's the bm25 index you \ncan only index it for search then you \ncan have then it's basically the same \nbehavior that you have before so filters \nif it's not specifically filter indexed \nit can still fall back to um to the the \nold index to the searchable index but if \nit has both then it just takes the the \nbest at each time then it's fully in \nyour control \num it's fully Backward Compatible so by \nby default we build both indexes but you \ncan take the turn them off and then \nsimply tune in so if you said Okay I I \nknow I'm only going to need so so for \nexample if the field is like a a user \ngroup that you need for permissions \nchecking or something you're never going \nto run a bm25 search over that you know \nit'll only be there for for filtering so \njust turn the searchable index off keep \nthe filterable index and then you get \nfast filters using bitmaps under the \nhood for string properties as well yeah \nit also makes me think about like you \ncould probably represent categorical uh \nvariables that way like if you have yeah \nyeah typical um so kind of yeah just \njust because it's a string doesn't \nnecessarily mean it's it's full text \nthat was kind of the assumption that we \nmade before but it simply doesn't hold \ntrue yeah super cool and and you can use \nthose with the wear filters yeah amazing \nstuff um so then there's um so now \nthere's more tokenization options as \nwell um \nyes you may be taking me through the \nthinking around the tokenization \nyeah yeah so \num mention string and text before and I \nthink this has been a big source of \nconfusion for for some users because \nsome users just assume that because it's \nstring it would use a specific kind of \ntokenization some users didn't even know \nthat there was a split between string \nand text so they used string for \nsomething that should have been text or \nuse text for something that should have \nbeen string and as I'm saying this well \nwhat should have been a string what \nshould have been a text like that's just \nnot clear that's that's very hard to \nexplain and that's why we've we've \nsimplified this and again all in a \nnon-breaking way so right now there's \nonly going to be text string basically \ndisappears nothing breaks for you you \ncan still in your apis or in your your \nschemas you can still set string and \nit'll be automatically converted to to \ntext and to keep that kind of difference \nthat we have before there are now more \ntokenization options so you can tokenize \nif you want buy the whole field which is \nsomething by the way that a lot of \npeople assume that that string would do \nbut it would only do that if you set the \ntokenization to field so right now \nthat's simply an option you can tokenize \nby word which basically means vv8 will \nsplit on the spaces but we'll keep the \nindividual things you can can or or will \nsort of keep the alphanumeric contents \nof the the words that will remove \nspecial characters you can also split \njust by white space which is sort of \nagain splitting at the word boundary but \nnot removing those special characters so \nfor example if it's like a a product \ndescription that has a special sign in \nit or something and you want to you want \nto keep that because it's relevant then \nyou can so again more control and \nsimpler API at the same time \nso keeping on the um the apis have been \num so I've started diving into \ntypescript and learning a little bit \nmore about that I've seen more of the \nconsistency level and um so the newest \nthing tunable consistency for Vector \nsearch and the get requests and all that \num yeah the whole so replication is \nsomething that you can so I hope I'm \ngetting this correctly and Eddie and \nwill correct me in a second if I'm wrong \nbut replication is like how you're \nreplicating your data across nodes in a \ncluster so so how does this work with \neach tune each query you can tune this \nyeah so the the there's two sides \nbasically for for tuning one is how do \nyou write your data and how do you reach \nyour data and they they somehow depend \non one another because for example if \nyou make sure that during writing every \nnote already has the same copy it \ndoesn't matter what you do add reading \nbecause if you just read it from one \nnote or if you read it from from \nmultiple nodes you already made sure \nthat they're in sync during during \nwriting however that has a large cost \nbecause now for every ride all the notes \nhave to basically agree on it all the \nnotes have to be alive so so um with \ntunable consistency the idea is to to \nmake some trade-offs basically you could \nsay I'm only uh writing with me with a \nmajority of notes and I'm also only \nreading with the majority of notes and \nthen you know okay we still got some \nconsistency guarantees basically because \num because if if both writes and reads \nhappened with with a majority of notes \nthen uh it should still be consistent or \nyou could say it's actually not super \ncritical that my data is always up to \ndate maybe you want to accept that it's \nsometimes a bit bit \num yeah eventually consistent so it \ncould temporarily be out of date and \nhasn't been repaired yet and that may be \nfine because maybe something that you're \nupdating is is yeah it's not a bank \naccount details or something or or Bank \ntransactions but rather product search \nwhere it's not a big issue if something \nis slightly outdated or maybe you can \ncatch it in the application side if it's \noutdated and \num yeah for for a graphql searches \nbasically that was the the last point \nthat we had where we didn't have tunable \nconsistency yet and for those three \nqueries you can now set it there as well \namazing uh so everyone we are a little \ntime constrained so we're gonna we're \ncutting it a little short but um as \nalways the incredible devrel team and \nthere's this release blog post with all \nthese releases if you want to consult \nmore details Eddie and I are available \nin slack and more than happy to answer \nany of your questions so grpc generative \ncohere Group by arbitrary property \nbitmap indexing more fine-grained \ncontrol over that with the tech surge \ndeprecating string with more \ntokenization than the tunable \nconsistency and some patch releases So \nyeah thank you so
