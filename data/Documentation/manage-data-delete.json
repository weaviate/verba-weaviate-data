See Manage data: multi-tenancy operations for details on how.\n\n\n\n  Why specify the class name?\n  \n\n\n\n## Delete object by id\n\nTo delete an object, specify its class name and id as shown below.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\nYou can also make a `DELETE` request to the `/v1/objects` endpoint directly.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n -->\n\n\n## Delete multiple objects\n\nTo delete multiple objects that match a set of criteria, specify the class and a `where` filter.\n\nOptionally, set `output` to `'verbose'` to see more details (ID and deletion status).\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\nYou can also make `DELETE` request to the `/v1/batch/objects` endpoint directly.\n\nThere is a configurable maximum limit on the number of objects that can be deleted in a single query (default 10,000). To delete more objects than the limit, re-run the query.\n\n### ContainsAny / ContainsAll\n\nYou can use `ContainsAny` / `ContainsAll` filters with the `where` argument to delete objects that contains a specific value in a property.\n\nNote that when using `ContainsAny` or `ContainsAll`, the query must be entered as an array of values. The client-specific syntax varies as follows:\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n\n```js\nawait client.batch\n  .objectsBatchDeleter()\n  .withClassName('EphemeralObject')\n  .withWhere({\n    path: ['name'],\n    // highlight-start\n    operator: 'ContainsAny',\n    valueTextArray: ['asia', 'europe'],  // Note the array syntax\n    // highlight-end\n  })\n  // highlight-end\n  .do();\n```\n\n  \n  \n\n```java\nclient.batch().objectsBatchDeleter()\n  .withClassName(\"EphemeralObject\")\n  .withWhere(WhereFilter.builder()\n    .path(\"name\")\n    // highlight-start\n    .operator(Operator.ContainsAny)\n    .valueText(\"asia\", \"europe\")    // Note the array syntax\n    // highlight-end\n    .build())\n  .run();\n```\n\n  \n  \n\n```go\n  response, err := client.Batch().ObjectsBatchDeleter().\n    WithClassName(\"EphemeralObject\").\n    WithOutput(\"minimal\").\n    WithWhere(filters.Where().\n      WithPath([]string{\"name\"}).\n      // highlight-start\n      WithOperator(filters.ContainsAny).\n      WithValueText(\"asia\", \"europe\")).  // Note the array syntax\n      // highlight-end\n    Do(ctx)\n```\n\n  \n\n\n\n### Dry-run\n\nYou can set the `dryRun` option to check how many objects would be deleted, without actually performing the deletion.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n  Example response\n\nIt should produce a response like the one below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "manage-data-delete", "path": "developers/weaviate/manage-data/delete.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/manage-data/delete", "timestamp": "2023-11-13 10:40:51", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
