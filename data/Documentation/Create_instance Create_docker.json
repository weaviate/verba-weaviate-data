{"text": "\nIf you have [created a cloud instance](./10_create_wcs.mdx) of Weaviate, you can skip this page and continue with [Communicate with Weaviate](../30_communicate.mdx).\n\nHere, you will create a Weaviate instance using Docker.\n\n###  Download and run the docker-compose file\n\nInstall Docker on your machine. We recommend following the [official Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).\n\nCreate a new directory and navigate to it in your terminal. Then, create a new file called `docker-compose.yml` and add the following content:\n\n```yaml\n---\nversion: '3.4'\nservices:\n  weaviate_anon:\n    command:\n    - --host\n    - 0.0.0.0\n    - --port\n    - '8080'\n    - --scheme\n    - http\n    image: cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/weaviate:||site.weaviate_version||\n    ports:\n    - 8080:8080\n    - 50051:50051\n    restart: on-failure:0\n    environment:\n      OPENAI_APIKEY: $OPENAI_APIKEY\n      QUERY_DEFAULTS_LIMIT: 25\n      AUTHENTICATION_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS_ENABLED: 'true'\n      PERSISTENCE_DATA_PATH: '/var/lib/weaviate'\n      DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE: 'none'\n      ENABLE_MODULES: 'text2vec-cohere,text2vec-huggingface,text2vec-openai,generative-openai,generative-cohere'\n      BACKUP_FILESYSTEM_PATH: '/var/lib/weaviate/backups'\n      CLUSTER_HOSTNAME: 'node1'\n...\n\n```\n\n###  Create a Weaviate instance\n\nRun the following command to start Weaviate:\n\n```bash\ndocker compose up\n```\n\n###  Your Weaviate instance details\n\nOnce the instance is created, you can access it at `http://localhost:8080`.\n\n###  Connect to your Weaviate instance\n\nTo connect to the Weaviate instance, use the `connect_to_local` function.\n\n\n\n#### Provide inference API keys\n\nSome Weaviate modules can use inference APIs for vectorizing data or large language model integration. You can provide the API keys for these services to Weaviate at instantiation.\n\nThis course uses OpenAI, so you can provide the OpenAI API key to Weaviate through `headers={\"X-OpenAI-Api-Key\": }` as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "Create_instance Create_docker", "path": "developers/academy/py/starter_text_data/101_setup_weaviate/20_create_instance/20_create_docker.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/py/starter_text_data/setup_weaviate/create_instance/create_docker", "timestamp": "2024-05-08 10:48:12", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
