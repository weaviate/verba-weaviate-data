{"text": "\nFilters can be used to precisely refine search results. You can filter by properties as well as metadata, and you can combine multiple filters with `and` or `or` conditions to further narrow down the results.\n\n###  Code\n\nThis example finds entries in \"MovieMM\" based on their similarity to the query \"dystopian future\", only from those released after 2010. It prints out the title and release year of the top 5 matches.\n\n\n\n##  Explain the code\n\nThis query is identical to [that shown earlier](./10_multimodal.mdx) for search, but with the addition of a filter. The `filters` parameter here takes an instance of the `Filter` class to set the filter conditions. The current query filters the results to only include those with a release year after 2010.\n\n\n  Example results\n\n```text\nDune 2021\nDistance to query: 0.199\n\nTenet 2020\nDistance to query: 0.200\n\nMission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One 2023\nDistance to query: 0.207\n\nOnward 2020\nDistance to query: 0.214\n\nJurassic World Dominion 2022\nDistance to query: 0.216\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "Mm_searches Filters", "path": "developers/academy/py/starter_multimodal_data/103_mm_searches/30_filters.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/py/starter_multimodal_data/mm_searches/filters", "timestamp": "2024-05-08 10:48:08", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
