{"text": "\nWCS does not automatically upgrade existing clusters when a new version of Weaviate core is released. \n\nIf you have a stand-alone cluster, an upgrade requires system downtime. Consider your business needs, and upgrade your cluster when you have a suitable maintenance window. There is no downtime if you have a high availability (HA) cluster.\n\n## Check the server version\n\nCheck for a Weaviate server update.\n\n### Console message\n\nThe console displays a notification message in the console when a new version is available.\n\n![WCS Upgrade notification message](../img/wcs-upgrade-banner.jpg)\n\nClick to expand the notification.
