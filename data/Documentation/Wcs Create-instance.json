{"text": "\n\n\n## Create a cluster\n\nTo create a cluster, click the 'Create cluster' button on the WCS Dashboard page.\n\n![Create a cluster](./img/wcs-console-no-clusters.jpg)\n\nFollow the steps to create a cluster:\n\n- [Sandbox clusters](#sandbox-clusters)\n- [Managed clusters](#managed-clusters).\n\n### Sandbox clusters\n\nTo create a sandbox cluster, follow these steps:\n\nimport CreateSandboxCluster from '/_includes/wcs/create-cluster-sandbox.mdx'\n\n\n\n### Managed clusters\n\nManaged clusters require billing details. WCS prompts you to add billing details if you have not already added them.\n\nTo create a managed cluster, follow these steps:\n\nimport CreateManagedCluster from '/_includes/wcs/create-cluster-managed.mdx'\n\n\n\n## Authentication\n\nBy default, API keys are enabled for all WCS clusters. Managed clusters have an administrator key and a read-only key. Sandbox clusters only have an administrator key.\n\nWhen you develop your client application, use an API key to connect your client to the cluster. For more details, see [authentication](./authentication.mdx).\n\nTo get API keys, click the `API keys` button.\n\n![Details expanded](./img/wcs-console-details-api-key.jpg)\n\n## Weaviate core version\n\nWhen you provision a new cluster, WCS uses the current version of Weaviate core to set up the new cluster. There may be a short delay between the release of a new Weaviate core version and its availability in WCS.  \n\nWCS does not automatically update existing clusters when a new version of Weaviate core is released. \n\nFor more details on WCS versioning, see [Cluster server version](/developers/wcs/platform/version).\n\n## Support\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "Wcs Create-instance", "path": "developers/wcs/create-instance.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/create-instance", "timestamp": "2024-05-08 10:49:13", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
