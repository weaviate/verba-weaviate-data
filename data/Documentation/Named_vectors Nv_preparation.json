{"text": "\nThis course is self-contained. However, we recommend that you go through one of the 101-level courses, such as that for working with [text](../../starter_text_data/index.md), [your own vectors](../../starter_custom_vectors/index.md), or [multimodal data](../../starter_multimodal_data/index.md).\n\nThis page briefly covers the required resources and setup, including the Weaviate Python client library, and a Weaviate instance with the multi-modal vectorizer.\n\n##  Weaviate Python client library\n\nInstall the latest (`v4`, e.g. `4.5.0`) Weaviate Python client library with:\n\n```bash\npip install -U weaviate-client\n```\n\n##  Set up Weaviate\n\nInstall Docker on your machine. We recommend following the [official Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).\n\nCreate a new directory and navigate to it in your terminal. Then, create a new file called `docker-compose.yml` and add the following content:\n\n```yaml\n---\nversion: '3.4'\nservices:\n  weaviate:\n    command:\n    - --host\n    - 0.0.0.0\n    - --port\n    - '8080'\n    - --scheme\n    - http\n    image: cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/weaviate:||site.weaviate_version||\n    ports:\n    - 8080:8080\n    - 50051:50051\n    volumes:\n    - weaviate_data:/var/lib/weaviate\n    restart: on-failure:0\n    environment:\n      CLIP_INFERENCE_API: 'http://multi2vec-clip:8080'\n      QUERY_DEFAULTS_LIMIT: 25\n      AUTHENTICATION_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS_ENABLED: 'true'\n      PERSISTENCE_DATA_PATH: '/var/lib/weaviate'\n      DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE: 'multi2vec-clip'\n      ENABLE_MODULES: 'multi2vec-clip,text2vec-openai,generative-openai'\n      CLUSTER_HOSTNAME: 'node1'\n  multi2vec-clip:\n    image: cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/multi2vec-clip:sentence-transformers-clip-ViT-B-32-multilingual-v1\n    environment:\n      ENABLE_CUDA: '0'\nvolumes:\n  weaviate_data:\n...\n\n```\n\n###  Create a Weaviate instance\n\nRun the following command to start Weaviate:\n\n```bash\ndocker compose up\n```\n\n###  Your Weaviate instance details\n\nOnce the instance is created, you can access it at `http://localhost:8080`.\n\n##  Work with Weaviate\n\n###  Connect to your Weaviate instance\n\nTo connect to the Weaviate instance, use the `connect_to_local` function. We also provide API keys here for any inference APIs (e.g. OpenAI, Cohere, Google, AWS etc.) that Weaviate may use.\n\n\n\n###  Check Weaviate status\n\nYou can check whether the Weaviate instance is up using the `is_live` function.\n\n\n\n###  Retrieve server meta information\n\nYou can retrieve meta information about the Weaviate instance using the `meta` function.\n\n\n\nThis will print the server meta information to the console. The output will look similar to the following:\n\n\n  Example get_meta output\n\nNote that this output is a little longer due to the additional details from the CLIP models.\n\n\n\n\n###  Close the connection\n\nAfter you have finished using the Weaviate client, you should close the connection. This frees up resources and ensures that the connection is properly closed.\n\nWe suggest using a `try`-`finally` block as a best practice. For brevity, we will not include the `try`-`finally` blocks in the remaining code snippets.\n\n\n\n##  Source data\n\nWe are going to use a movie dataset sourced from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/). The dataset can be found in this [GitHub repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaviate-tutorials/edu-datasets/main/movies_data_1990_2024.json), and it contains bibliographic information on ~700 movies released between 1990 and 2024.\n\nAs a multimodal project, we'll also use [corresponding posters for each movie](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaviate-tutorials/edu-datasets/main/movies_data_1990_2024_posters.zip), which are available in the same repository.\n\n\n  See sample text data\n\n|    | backdrop_path                    | genre_ids       |   id | original_language   | original_title              | overview                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |   popularity | poster_path                      | release_date   | title                       | video   |   vote_average |   vote_count |\n|---:|:---------------------------------|:----------------|-----:|:--------------------|:----------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------:|:---------------------------------|:---------------|:----------------------------|:--------|---------------:|-------------:|\n|  0 | /3Nn5BOM1EVw1IYrv6MsbOS6N1Ol.jpg | [14, 18, 10749] |  162 | en                  | Edward Scissorhands         | A small suburban town receives a visit from a castaway unfinished science experiment named Edward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |       45.694 | /1RFIbuW9Z3eN9Oxw2KaQG5DfLmD.jpg | 1990-12-07     | Edward Scissorhands         | False   |            7.7 |        12305 |\n|  1 | /sw7mordbZxgITU877yTpZCud90M.jpg | [18, 80]        |  769 | en                  | GoodFellas                  | The true story of Henry Hill, a half-Irish, half-Sicilian Brooklyn kid who is adopted by neighbourhood gangsters at an early age and climbs the ranks of a Mafia family under the guidance of Jimmy Conway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |       57.228 | /aKuFiU82s5ISJpGZp7YkIr3kCUd.jpg | 1990-09-12     | GoodFellas                  | False   |            8.5 |        12106 |\n|  2 | /6uLhSLXzB1ooJ3522ydrBZ2Hh0W.jpg | [35, 10751]     |  771 | en                  | Home Alone                  | Eight-year-old Kevin McCallister makes the most of the situation after his family unwittingly leaves him behind when they go on Christmas vacation.
