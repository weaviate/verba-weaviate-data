{"text": "\n\n\n## Overview\n\nThese **search** how-to guides aim to help you find the data you want using Weaviate.\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend starting with the query basics page.\n- It covers the basic syntax of a search (i.e. `Get`) query, and how to specify the properties you want to retrieve.\n\nThen, move onto a how-to guide of your choice. We have separate how-to guides for:\n\n- Similarity: Covers `nearXXX` searches, which work by searching for objects with the most similar vector representation to the query.\n- Image: Similarity search involving images.\n- BM25: A keyword search that ranks results with the BM25F search function.\n- Hybrid: Combines BM25 and similarity search to rank results.\n- Generative: Feed search results to an LLM with a prompt using a `generative` module.\n- Reranking: Rerank retrieved search results using a `reranker` module.\n- Aggregate: Aggregate data from a results set.\n- Filters: Apply conditional filters to the search.\n\nEach guide is self-contained. So you can read them in any order.\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "weaviate-search", "path": "developers/weaviate/search/index.md", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search", "timestamp": "2023-11-13 10:41:33", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
