{"text": "\nFor this unit, you can choose to create a Weaviate Cloud Service (WCS) instance or a local Docker instance.\n\n- [Create a cloud WCS instance](./10_create_wcs.mdx)\n    - If you want a managed service and don't want to worry about installation and maintenance.\n- [Create a local Docker instance](./20_create_docker.mdx)\n    - If you want to run Weaviate on your local machine, or want to have full control over the installation and maintenance.\n\nEither option is fine for this course. If you're not sure which to choose, we recommend starting with a WCS instance.\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "Setup_weaviate Create_instance", "path": "developers/academy/py/starter_text_data/101_setup_weaviate/20_create_instance/index.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/py/starter_text_data/setup_weaviate/create_instance", "timestamp": "2024-05-08 10:48:13", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
