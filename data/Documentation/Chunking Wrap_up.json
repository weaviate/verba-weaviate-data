{"text": "\nimport PreviewUnit from '../../../_snippets/preview.mdx'\n\n\n\n##  Unit review\n\nIn this unit, you have learned about chunking, which is a technique of splitting up longer texts into smaller pieces of text, or \"chunks\".\n\nWe covered how it can impact information retrieval using vector databases, and how it can affect the performance of retrieval augmented generation.\n\nThen, we then moved on to cover various chunking techniques including fixed-size chunking, variable-size chunking, and hybrid chunking. We also discussed key considerations when deciding on a chunking strategy, as well as some suggested starting points.\n\nThe unit was rounded off with a discussion of some points of consideration when chunking data. These included the length of text per search result, the input query length, the size of the database, the requirements of the language model, and the RAG workflow.\n\nWe hope that you now have a good understanding of chunking in general, and are able to implement some solid chunking strategies based on your actual needs.\n\n###  Learning outcomes\n\nHaving finished this unit, you should be able to:\n- Describe what chunking is at a high level\n- Explain the impact of chunking in vector search and generative search\n- Implement various chunking methods and know where to explore others, and\n- Evaluate chunking strategies based on your needs\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "Chunking Wrap_up", "path": "developers/academy/py/standalone/chunking/90_wrap_up.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/py/standalone/chunking/wrap_up", "timestamp": "2024-05-08 10:47:48", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
