{"text": "\nimport BeaconsBackCompatOmitClassname from '/_includes/beacons-backcompat-omit-class.md'\n\n\n## List data objects\n\nUse the [`after`](#exhaustive-listing-using-a-cursor-after) operator.\n\nList data objects in reverse order of creation. The data will be returned as an array of objects.\n\nA: This `Aggregate` query will output a total object count in a class.\n\n\n\n#### Method and URL\n\nWithout any restrictions (across classes, default limit = 25):\n\n```http\nGET /v1/objects\n```\n\nWith optional query params:\n\n```http\nGET /v1/objects?class={ClassName}&limit={limit}&include={include}\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n| ---- | ---- | ----------- |\n| `class` | string | List objects by class using the class name. |\n| `limit` | integer | The maximum number of data objects to return. Default 25. |\n| `offset` | integer | The offset of objects returned (the starting index of the returned objects).Cannot be used with `after`.Should be used in conjunction with `limit`. |\n| `after` | string | Returned objects follow the object with this ID. This object is not part of the set.Must be used with `class`Cannot be used with `offset` or `sort`.Should be used in conjunction with `limit`. |\n| `include` | string | Include additional information, such as classification info. Allowed values include: `classification`, `vector`, `featureProjection` and other module-specific additional properties. |\n| `sort` | string | Name of the property to sort by - i.e. `sort=city`You can also provide multiple names \u2013 i.e. `sort=country,city` |\n| `order` | string | Order in which to sort by.Possible values: `asc` (default) and `desc`. Should be used in conjunction with `sort`.|\n\n### Paging: `offset`\n\nYou can use `limit` and `offset` for paging results.\n\nThe `offset` parameter is a flexible way to page results as it allows use with parameters such as `sort`. It is limited by the value of `QUERY_MAXIMUM_RESULTS` which sets the maximum total number of objects that can be listed using this parameter.\n\nGet the first 10 objects:\n```http\nGET /v1/objects?class=MyClass&limit=10\n```\n\nGet the second batch of 10 objects:\n```http\nGET /v1/objects?class=MyClass&limit=10&offset=10\n```\n\nGet the next batch of 10 objects:\n```http\nGET /v1/objects?class=MyClass&limit=10&offset=20\n```\n\n### Exhaustive listing using a cursor: `after`\n\n- Available from version `v1.18.0`.\n- You can use `class`, `limit` and `after` for listing an entire object set from a class.\n- The `after` operator is based on the order of ids. It can therefore only be applied to list queries without sorting.\n\nYou can use the `after` operator to retrieve all objects from a Weaviate instance . The `after` operator (\"Cursor API\") retrieves objects of a class based on the order of ids. You can pass the id of the last retrieved object as a cursor to start the next page.\n\nIt is not possible to use the `after` operator without specifying a `class`.\n\nFor a null value similar to `offset=0`, set `after=` or `after` (i.e. with an empty string) in the request.\n\n#### Examples\n\nGet the first 10 objects of `MyClass`:\n```http\nGET /v1/objects?class=MyClass&limit=10\n```\n\nIf the last object in the retrieved set above was `b1645a32-0c22-5814-8f35-58f142eadf7e`, you can retrieve the next 10 objects of `MyClass` after it as below:\n\n```http\nGET /v1/objects?class=MyClass&limit=10&after=b1645a32-0c22-5814-8f35-58f142eadf7e\n```\n\n### Example sorting\n\nYou can use `sort` and `order` to sort your results.\n\nAscending sort by author_name:\n```http\nGET /v1/objects?class=Book&sort=author_name\n```\n\nDescending sort by author_name:\n```http\nGET /v1/objects?class=Book&sort=author_name&order=desc\n```\n\nSort by by author_name, and then title.\n```http\nGET /v1/objects?class=Book&sort=author_name,title\n```\n\nSort by author_name, and then title with order:\n```http\nGET /v1/objects?class=Book&sort=author_name,title&order=desc,asc\n```\n\n### Response fields\n\nThe response of a `GET` query of a data object will give you information about all objects [(or a single object)](#get-a-data-object). Next to general information about the data objects, like schema information and property values, meta information will be shown depending on the `include` fields or `additional properties` of your request.\n\n#### Response format\n\n```js\n{\n  \"objects\": [/* list of objects, see below */],\n  \"deprecations\": null,\n}\n```\n\n### Object fields\n\n| Field name | Data type | Required `include` or `additional` field | Description |\n| ---------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------- |\n| `class` | string | none | The class name. |\n| `creationTimeUnix` | unix timestamp | none | The time stamp of creation of the data object. |\n| `id` | uuid | none | The uuid of the data object. |\n| `lastUpdateTimeUnix` | unix timestamp | none | The time stamp when the data object was last updated. |\n| `properties` > `{propertyName}` | dataType | none | The name and value of an individual property. |\n| `properties` > `{crefPropertyName}` > `classification` > `closestLosingDistance` | float | `classification` | The lowest distance of a neighbor in the losing group. Optional. If `k` equals the size of the winning group, there is no losing group. |\n| `properties` > `{crefPropertyName}` > `classification` > `closestOverallDistance` | float | `classification` | The lowest distance of any neighbor, regardless of whether they were in the winning or losing. |\n| `properties` > `{crefPropertyName}` > `classification` > `closestWinningDistance` | float | `classification` | Closest distance of a neighbor from the winning group. |\n| `properties` > `{crefPropertyName}` > `classification` > `losingCount` | integer | `classification` | Size of the losing group, can be 0 if the winning group size equals `k`. |\n| `properties` > `{crefPropertyName}` > `classification` > `meanLosingDistance` | float | `classification` | The mean distance of the losing group. It is a normalized distance (between 0 and 1), where 0 means equal and 1 would mean a perfect opposite. |\n| `properties` > `{crefPropertyName}` > `classification` > `meanWinningDistance` | float | `classification` | The mean distance of the winning group. It is a normalized distance (between 0 and 1), where 0 means equal and 1 would mean a perfect opposite. |\n| `properties` > `{crefPropertyName}` > `classification` > `overallCount` | integer | `classification` | Overall neighbors checked as part of the classification. In most cases this will equal `k`, but could be lower than `k` - for example if not enough data was present. |\n| `properties` > `{crefPropertyName}` > `classification` > `winningCount` | integer | `classification` | Size of the winning group, a number between 1 and `k`. |\n| `vector` | list of floats | `vector` | The vector embedding computed for the object. |\n| `classification` > `basedOn` | string |  `classification` | The property name where the classification was based on. |\n| `classification` > `classifiedFields` | string |  `classification` | The classified property. |\n| `classification` > `completed` | timestamp |  `classification` | The time of classification completion. |\n| `classification` > `id` | uuid |  `classification` | The classification id. |\n| `classification` > `scope` | list of strings |  `classification` | The initial fields to classify. |\n| `featureProjection` > `vector` | list of floats |  `featureProjection` | The 2D or 3D vector coordinates of the feature projection. |\n\n### Status codes and error cases\n\n| Cause | Description | Result |\n| ----- | ----------- | ------ |\n| No objects present | No `?class` is provided. There are no objects present in the entire Weaviate instance. | `200 OK` - No error |\n| Valid class, no objects present | `?class` is provided, class exists.

The provided meta-data and schema values are validated.\n\n#### Method and URL\n\n```http\nPOST /v1/objects[?consistency_level=ONE|QUORUM|ALL]\n```\n\nThe class name is not specified in the URL, as it is part of the request body.\n\n#### Parameters\n\nThe URL supports an optional [consistency level](../../concepts/replication-architecture/consistency.md#tunable-write-consistency) query parameter:\n\n| Name | Location | Type | Description |\n| ---- | -------- | ---- |------------ |\n| `consistency_level` | query param | string | Optional [consistency level](../../concepts/replication-architecture/consistency.md#tunable-write-consistency): `ONE`, `QUORUM` (default) or `ALL`. |\n\nThe request body for a new object has the following fields:\n\n| Name | Type | Required | Description |\n| ---- | ---- | -------- |------------ |\n| `class` | string | yes | The class name as defined in the schema |\n| `properties` | array | yes | An object with the property values of the new data object |\n| `properties` > `{propertyName}` | dataType | yes | The property and its value according to the set dataType |\n| `id` | v4 UUID | no | Optional id for the object |\n| `vector` | `[float]` | no | Optional [custom vector](#with-a-custom-vector) |\n| `tenant` | `string` | no | Optional tenant name. [Multi-tenancy](../../concepts/data.md#multi-tenancy) must be enabled first. |\n\n#### Example request\n\n\n\n### `objects` vs `batch`\n\nThe `objects` endpoint is meant for individual object creations.\n\nIf you plan on importing a large number of objects, it's much more efficient to use the [`/v1/batch`](./batch.md) endpoint. Otherwise, sending multiple single requests sequentially would incur a large performance penalty:\n\n1. Each sequential request would be handled by a single thread server-side while most of the server resources are idle. In addition, if you only send the second request once the first has been completed, you will wait for a lot of network overhead.\n1. It's much more efficient to parallelize imports. This will minimize the connection overhead and use multiple threads server-side for indexing.\n1. You do not have to do the parallelization yourself, you can use the [`/v1/batch`](./batch.md) endpoint for this. Even if you are sending batches from a single client thread, the objects within a batch will be handled by multiple server threads.\n1. Import speeds, especially for large datasets, will drastically improve when using the batching endpoint.\n\nThe idempotence behavior differs between these two endpoints. POST /batch/objects is idempotent, and will overwrite any existing object given an id. POST /objects will fail if an id is provided which already exists in the class.\n\nTo update an existing object with the `objects` endpoint, use the [PUT or PATCH method](#update-a-data-object).\n\n### With geoCoordinates\n\nIf you want to supply a [`geoCoordinates`](/developers/weaviate/config-refs/datatypes.md#datatype-geocoordinates) property, you need to specify the `latitude` and `longitude` as floating point decimal degrees:\n\n\n\n\n\n### With a custom vector\n\nWhen creating a data object, you can configure Weaviate to generate a vector with a vectorizer module, or you can provide the vector yourself. We sometimes refer to this as a \"custom\" vector.\n\nYou can provide a custom vector during object creation either when:\n- you are not using a vectorizer for that class, or\n- you are using a vectorizer, but you wish to bypass it during the object creation stage.\n\nYou can create a data object with a custom vector as follows:\n1. Set the `\"vectorizer\"` in the relevant class in the [data schema](../../manage-data/collections.mdx#specify-a-vectorizer).\n    - If you are not using a vectorizer at all, configure the class accordingly. To do this, you can:\n        - set the default vectorizer module to `\"none\"` (`DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE=\"none\"`), or\n        - set the `\"vectorizer\"` for the class to `\"none\"` (`\"vectorizer\": \"none\"`) (*note: the class `vectorizer` setting will override the `DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE` parameter*).\n    - If you wish to bypass the vectorizer for object creation:\n      - set the vectorizer to the same vectorizer with identical settings used to generate the custom vector\n    > *Note: There is NO validation of this vector besides checking the vector length.*\n2. Then, attach the vector in a special `\"vector\"` field during object creation. For example, if adding a single object, you can:\n\n\n\nYou can set custom vectors for batch imports as well as single object creation.\n\nSee also [how to search using custom vectors](../graphql/search-operators.md#nearvector).\n\n## Get a data object\n\nCollect an individual data object.\n\n#### Method and URL\n\nAvailable since `v1.14` and the preferred way:\n```bash\nGET /v1/objects/{ClassName}/{id}[?consistency_level=ONE|QUORUM|ALL&tenant={tenant}]\n```\n\n\n  Getting a data object without a class name is deprecated\n\nThe following syntax is deprecated.

Internally it skips reading the object from disk (other than checking if it is present), thus not using resources on marshalling, parsing, etc.\nAdditionally, the resulting HTTP request has no body; the existence of an object is indicated solely by the status code (`204` when the object exists, `404` when it doesn't, `422` on invalid ID).\n\n#### Method and URL\n\nAvailable since `v1.14` and the preferred way:\n```bash\nHEAD /v1/objects/{ClassName}/{id}[?consistency_level=ONE|QUORUM|ALL]\n```\n\n\n  Checking if a data object exists without a class name is deprecated\n\nThe following syntax is deprecated.
