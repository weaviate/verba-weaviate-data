{"text": "\n\n\n## Capabilities\n\nSandbox clusters run a full version of the Weaviate core database. When you create a sandbox, it has the latest version of [Weaviate core](/developers/weaviate/release-notes#weaviate-core).\n\nWeaviate core uses modules to connect to vectorizers, rankers, generators, and other services. [Modules](/developers/weaviate/modules) provide programmatic connections to these services. WCS provides built in modules for more than a dozen services. To see the list of modules that are available for your cluster, check the cluster details panel in the [Weaviate web console](https://console.weaviate.cloud).\n\n## Suggested uses\n\nSandbox clusters are intended for learning, experimenting, and exploring. Sandboxes are fully featured, but they have a limited lifetime and they run on scaled down infrastructure compared to managed clusters. \n\nIf you are working through a course in [Weaviate Academy](https://weaviate.io/developers/academy), consider using a sandbox to complete the lessons without having to install and configure a local instance.\n\n## Limitations\n\nSandboxes are not designed for production use. Compared to managed instances, they are limited in size, duration, and operational resilience. Sandboxes have these limits:\n\n- 14 day lifespan\n- No backup\n- One `admin` API key\n- No `read-only` API key\n- Fixed instance size\n- Less memory capacity than the smallest managed cluster\n- Less processor capacity than the smallest managed cluster\n- Less storage capacity than the smallest managed cluster\n\n## Export data\n\n\n\n## Switch to a managed cluster\n\nThere is no direct path to convert a sandbox cluster to a managed cluster. Follow these steps to move to a managed cluster.\n\n1. [Export your data](#export-your-data).\n1. [Export your schema](#export-your-schema).\n1. [Configure billing](#configure-billing) in your WCS account.\n1. [Create a managed cluster](#create-a-managed-cluster).\n1. [Recreate your schema](#recreate-your-schema).\n1. [Import your data](#import-your-data).\n\n### Export your data\n\n\n\n### Export your schema\n\nTo export your collection definitions, follow these steps:\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n### Configure billing\n\nTo configure billing, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n### Create a managed cluster\n\nManaged clusters require billing details. WCS prompts you to add billing details if you have not already added them.\n\nTo create a managed cluster, follow these steps:\n\nimport CreateManagedCluster from '/_includes/wcs/create-cluster-managed.mdx'\n\n\n\nThe managed cluster has new API keys. Update the API keys in your client code to use the new keys. \n \n### Recreate your schema\n\nUse the exported (sandbox cluster) schema to recreate the collection schema in the managed cluster. For more details on creating schemas, see [Manage collections](/developers/weaviate/manage-data/collections#create-a-collection).\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n### Import your data\n\nUse the [batch import API](/developers/weaviate/manage-data/import) to import your data into the managed cluster. \n\nIf your data file is very large, consider [streaming](/developers/weaviate/manage-data/import#stream-data-from-large-files) your upload.\n\n## Duration\n\nSandboxes expire after 14 days. When the sandbox expires, the data is deleted and cannot be retrieved.\nWCS sends an email notification approximately three days before a sandbox is due to expire. \n\nSandboxes can be extended three times. Each extension is for an additional 14 day period. To extend your sandbox, [contact support](mailto:support@weaviate.io).\n\n## Support\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "Wcs Sandbox", "path": "developers/wcs/sandbox.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/sandbox", "timestamp": "2024-05-08 10:49:16", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
