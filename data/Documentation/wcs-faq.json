{"text": "\n## Frequently asked questions\n\n### Accounts\n\n#### Q: Can I reset or change my account password?\n\n> Yes, you can do so on the WCS login page by clicking \"Forgot Password\".\n\n### Sandbox\n\n#### Q: When will my sandbox expire?\n\n> Currently, it will expire in 14 days.\n\n#### Q: How can I preserve my sandbox data?\n\n> If you would like to preserve your sandbox data, you can retrieve your data with our cursor API, or contact us to upgrade to a production SaaS instance.\n\n#### Q: How many objects can I have in a sandbox instance?\n\n> There is no hard limit on the sandbox database size, but its performance may be limited for larger workloads (e.g. millions of objects) due to the provisioned resources.\n\n### Instance management\n\n#### Q: Are WCS clusters backed up?\n\n> We do automated daily backups, and additionally whenever a Weaviate version is updated on the cluster.\n\n#### Q: Can WCS clusters be updated to newer versions of Weaviate?\n\n> Yes. Once a new version is enabled on WCS, you will see a button next to the Weaviate version display on the cluster details to trigger the update.\n\n#### Q: Are WCS clusters' resources automatically scaled?\n\n> Not currently. At the moment, we provision each instance for \u201cmost common\u201d usage scenarios.\n\n#### Q: What do I do if I prefer a heavier-load WCS instance?\n\n> If you feel that your use case requires a customized hardware provisioning, please reach out to us first. We can then work with you to evaluate and potentially create a managed cluster.\n\n### Infrastructure\n\n#### Q: What infrastructure does WCS run on?\n\n> Currently it runs on GCP, with plans to add AWS and Azure in the near future.\n\n### Console\n\n#### Q: Does the WCS console collect data from users?\n\n> The console never collects any data from your Weaviate instance; you can safely connect every instance, also over VPN.\n\n#### Q: Can the WCS console connect to non-WCS instances?\n\n> Yes, the WCS console can connect to a Weaviate instance regardless of whether it is a WCS instance or not.\n\n### Others\n\n#### Q: Why can't I see my old WCS sandbox?\n\n> If you created a sandbox on our legacy system at `console.weaviate.io`, it will be visible through here but not on the new WCS (at https://console.weaviate.cloud).\n\n## More resources\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "wcs-faq", "path": "developers/wcs/faq.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/faq", "timestamp": "2023-11-13 10:39:52", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
