{"text": "\nA 'single prompt' generation wil perform RAG queries on each retrieved object. This is useful when you want to transform each object separately, with the same prompt.\n\n###  Code\n\nThis example finds entries in \"MovieMM\" based on their similarity to [this image of the International Space Station](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/International_Space_Station_after_undocking_of_STS-132.jpg/440px-International_Space_Station_after_undocking_of_STS-132.jpg). Then, instructs the large language model to translate the title of each movie into French.\n\nEach of the results are then printed out to the console.\n\n\n\n##  Explain the code\n\nYou must pass on one or more properties to the `single_prompt` parameter through braces, as we've done here with `\"... {title} ...\"`. This will instruct Weaviate to pass on the `title` property from each retrieved object to the large language model.\n\n\n  Example results\n\n```text\nInterstellar\nInterstellaire\nGravity\nGravit\u00e9\nArrival\nArriv\u00e9e\nArmageddon\nArmageddon\nGodzilla\nGodzilla\n```\n\n\n\n###  Response object\n\nEach response object is similar to that from a regular search query, with an additional `generated` attribute. This attribute will contain the generated output for each object.\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "Mm_rag Single_prompt", "path": "developers/academy/py/starter_multimodal_data/104_mm_rag/20_single_prompt.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/py/starter_multimodal_data/mm_rag/single_prompt", "timestamp": "2024-05-08 10:48:09", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
