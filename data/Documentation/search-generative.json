{"text": "\n\n`Generative` search, also known as \"Retrieval Augmented Generation\" (RAG), is a multi-stage process.\nFirst Weaviate performs a query, then it passes the retrieved results and a prompt to a large language model (LLM), to generate a new output.\n\n\n  \n    Additional information\n  \n\n### Configure generative search\n\n1. Configure Weaviate to use a generator module. For details, see the module reference page:\n\n   - `generative-openai`\n   - `generative-cohere`\n   - `generative-palm`\n\n 2. Configure the target collection to use the generator module. For details, see schema configuration on the module reference page.\n 3. Query your database to retrieve one or more objects.\n 4. Use the query results to generate a new result.\n\n    - `single prompt`\n    - `grouped task`\n\n\n\n\n## Single prompt search\n\nSingle prompt search returns a generated response for each object in the query results.\nDefine object `properties` \u2013 using `{prop-name}` syntax \u2013 to interpolate retrieved content in the prompt.\nThe properties you use in the prompt do not have to be among the properties you retrieve in the query.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  Example response\n\nThe output is like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n## Grouped task search\n\nGrouped task search returns one response that includes all of the query results. By default grouped task search uses all object `properties` in the prompt.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  Example response\n\nThe output is like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n## Set grouped task prompt properties\n\n\nDefine object `properties` to use in the prompt. This limits the information in the prompt and reduces prompt length.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  Example response\n\nThe output is like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n## Related pages\n\n- References: Modules: generative-openai\n- References: Modules: generative-cohere\n- References: Modules: generative-palm\n- API References: GraphQL: Get\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "search-generative", "path": "developers/weaviate/search/generative.md", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search/generative", "timestamp": "2024-02-08 20:23:37", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
