{"text": "\nFilters can be used to precisely refine search results. You can filter by properties as well as metadata, and you can combine multiple filters with `and` or `or` conditions to further narrow down the results.\n\n###  Code\n\nThis example finds entries in \"Movie\" based on their similarity to the query vector, only from those released after 2010. It prints out the title and release year of the top 5 matches.\n\n\n\n##  Explain the code\n\nThis query is identical to [that shown earlier](./10_vector.mdx) for vector search, but with the addition of a filter. The `filters` parameter here takes an instance of the `Filter` class to set the filter conditions. The current query filters the results to only include those with a release year after 2010.\n\n\n  Example results\n\n```text\nOppenheimer 2023\nDistance to query: 0.754\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once 2022\nDistance to query: 0.778\n\nMeg 2: The Trench 2023\nDistance to query: 0.779\n\nEternals 2021\nDistance to query: 0.787\n\nJohn Wick: Chapter 4 2023\nDistance to query: 0.790\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "Object_searches Filters", "path": "developers/academy/py/starter_custom_vectors/103_object_searches/30_filters.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/py/starter_custom_vectors/object_searches/filters", "timestamp": "2024-05-08 10:47:59", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
