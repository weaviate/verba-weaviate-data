{"text": "\nThe Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS) query application (query app) is a browser-based GraphQL IDE. Use the query app to work interactively with your WCS clusters.\n\n![WCS query app](./img/wcs-console-example-query.png)\n\n[GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main/packages/graphiql) is built into the query app. GraphiQL provides many features that make GraphQL easier to use interactively:\n\n- Syntax highlighting\n- Intelligent type ahead\n- Automatic completion for queries and variables\n- Real-time error highlighting and reporting for queries and variables\n\n\n## Open the query app\n\nTo open the query app, connect to your WCS [WCS Dashboard](https://console.weaviate.cloud). \n\nIn the left-hand menu, click the Query app icon.\n\n\n\n## Select a Weaviate instance\n\nThe query app connects directly to your WCS clusters. The query app can also connect to other Weaviate instances if you have the proper authorization credentials.\n\n### Connect to a WCS cluster\n\n\nIn this example, the WCS Dashboard is connected to an external instance as well as the two WCS instances.\n\n\n\nThe GraphQL console can be used to query any of the three instances.\n\nClick the `Query` button for a cluster to open a console window connected to that cluster.\n\nAlternatively, the query window includes a drop-down menu at the top of the screen which can be used to choose the desired instance.\n\n\n\n\n### Authentication\n\nThe query app connects to WCS instances, sandboxes and managed clusters,without any additional authentication details.\n\n### Pass inference keys\n\nTo pass API keys for inference modules such as `text2vec-cohere`, `text2vec-cohere`, or `text2vec-openai`, use request headers. The `Header` tab is at bottom of the query screen. Add the service inference key to the query headers. \n\nIn this example, the `X-OpenAI-Api-Key` header sets the OpenAI API key.\n\n\n\nThe header can pass multiple keys.\n\n\n\n## More resources\n\n- [GraphiQL library](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/tree/main/packages/graphiql)\n- [Vectorizer modules](/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/) \n\n## Support\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "Wcs Console", "path": "developers/wcs/console.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/console", "timestamp": "2024-05-08 10:49:12", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
