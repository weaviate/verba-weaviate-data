{"text": "\n\nThe current Weaviate CLI version is `v||site.weaviate_cli_version||`.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe Weaviate CLI is available on Pypi.org. The package can be easily installed using pip. The client is developed and tested for Python 3.7 and higher.\n\nThe Weaviate CLI can be installed with:\n\n```sh\npip install weaviate-cli\n```\n\nTo check if the cli is installed correctly, run:\n\n```sh\nweaviate version\n```\n\nwhich should return ||site.weaviate_cli_version||.\n\n## Functions\n\n### Configuration\n\nYou need to configure the CLI tool before you can interact with you Weaviate instance. This can be done manually or by adding flags to commands.\n- Manually (interactive):\n  ```sh\n  weaviate config set\n  ```\n  or\n  ```sh\n  weaviate init\n  ```\n  After which you will be asked to enter the Weaviate URL and authentication mode.\n\n- Flags: if you didn't configure the CLI manually, you can add a configuration flag pointing to a configuration json file (`--config-file myconfig.json`) with every command you execute.\n\n  ```bash\n  weaviate --config-file myconfig.json\n  ```\n\n  in which `myconfig.json` should look like:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"url\": \"http://localhost:8080\",\n    \"auth\": null\n  }\n  ```\n  or\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"url\": \"http://localhost:8080\",\n    \"auth\": {\n        \"type\": \"client_secret\",\n        \"secret\": \n    }\n  }\n  ```\n  or\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"url\": \"http://localhost:8080\",\n    \"auth\": {\n        \"type\": \"username_and_password\",\n        \"user\": ,\n        \"pass\": \n    }\n  }\n  ```\n  or\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"url\": \"http://localhost:8080\",\n    \"auth\": {\n        \"type\": \"api_key\",\n        \"api_key\": \n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\nYou can view the configuration with the command:\n\n```sh\nweaviate config view\n```\n\n### Ping\nYou can ping the Weaviate URL you're connected to with:\n```sh\nweaviate ping\n```\n\nWhich returns `Weaviate is reachable!` if the connection with the Weaviate server is set up correctly.\n\n\n### Schema\nThere are three operations available with regard to the schema: import, export and truncate.\n\n#### Import\n\nAdding a schema can be done via:\n\n```sh\nweaviate schema import my_schema.json\n```\n\nWhere `my_schema.json` contains the schema as described here.\n\nTo overwrite your schema you can use the `--force` flag, this will clear the index and replace your schema:\n\n```sh\nweaviate schema import --force my_schema.json # using --force will delete your data\n```\n\n#### Export\nYou can export a schema to a json file that is present in the Weaviate instance by:\n\n```sh\nweaviate schema export my_schema.json\n```\n\nWhere `my_schema.json` can be replaces by a json file and local location. Naturally this function only outputs the schema to the given location when a schema is present in Weaviate.\n\n#### Truncate\n\nWith `delete` you can remove the entire schema and all the data that is associated with it. You will be asked for confirmation unless the `--force` flag is added.\n\n```sh\nweaviate schema delete\n```\n\n### Data\n\n#### Import\nThe `import` function enables data import from a json file. When the flag `--fail-on-error` is added, this command execution will fail if an error was thrown by Weaviate when loading the data object in.\n\n```sh\nweaviate data import my_data_objects.json\n```\n\nThe json file and location is passed in the command. The file needs to be formatted according to the Weaviate data schema, for example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"classes\": [\n        {\n            \"class\": \"Publication\",\n            \"id\": \"f81bfe5e-16ba-4615-a516-46c2ae2e5a80\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"name\": \"New York Times\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"class\": \"Author\",\n            \"id\": \"36ddd591-2dee-4e7e-a3cc-eb86d30a4303\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"name\": \"Jodi Kantor\",\n                \"writesFor\": [{\n                    \"beacon\": \"weaviate://localhost/f81bfe5e-16ba-4615-a516-46c2ae2e5a80\",\n                    \"href\": \"/v1/f81bfe5e-16ba-4615-a516-46c2ae2e5a80\"\n                }]\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Empty\nWith `delete` you can remove all data objects in Weaviate. You will be asked for confirmation unless the `--force` flag is added.\n\n```sh\nweaviate data delete\n```\n## Change logs\n\nCheck the change logs on GitHub for updates on the latest `CLI` changes.\n\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "client-libraries-cli", "path": "developers/weaviate/client-libraries/cli.md", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/cli", "timestamp": "2023-11-02 10:52:35", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
