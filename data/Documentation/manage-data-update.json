{"text": "\n\n\n\nWeaviate allows partial or complete object updates.\n\n\n\n  Additional information\n\n  - Partial updates use `PATCH` requests to the `/v1/objects` REST API endpoint under the hood.\n  - Complete updates use `PUT` requests to the `/v1/objects` REST API endpoint under the hood.\n  - Updates that include a `vector` property will recalculate the vector embedding (unless all updated `text` properties are skipped).\n  - To update objects, you must provide the collection name, id and properties to update.\n  - For multi-tenancy collections, you will also need to specify the tenant name. See Manage data: multi-tenancy operations for details on how.\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Update object properties\n\nUpdate one or more properties by providing the collection name, id and properties to update.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n## Update object vector\n\nThe object vector can also be updated similarly to properties.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n\n  >  Coming soon (vote for the feature request)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  >  Coming soon\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  >  Coming soon\n\n  \n\n\n\n## Replace an entire object\n\nThe entire object can be replaced by providing the collection name, id and the new object.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n## Delete a property\n\nDeleting or updating properties in the collection definition is not yet supported.\n\nAt object level, you can replace the object with a copy that has those properties deleted, or set to `\"\"` for text properties.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n## Related pages\n\n- References: REST - /v1/objects\n\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "manage-data-update", "path": "developers/weaviate/manage-data/update.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/manage-data/update", "timestamp": "2024-02-08 20:23:04", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
