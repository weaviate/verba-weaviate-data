{"text": "\n##  Unit review\n\nIn this unit, you saw how data is structured in Weaviate, and got hands-on experience populating your own instance of Weaviate from start to finish.\n\nYou have got hands-on experience in defining and creating a schema including classes, properties, data types and vectorization configurations. You also had a chance to import data according to this schema, and learned how to use batch imports to ensure that imports are as fast as possible.\n\nNow, you should have a broad understanding of Weaviate's indexes and schema, and how they work to store data to enable efficient, flexible, and powerful retrieval.\n\n###  Learning outcomes\n\nHaving finished this unit, you should be able to:\n- Describe how the schema and indexes relate to how data is stored in Weaviate.\n- Understand how classes and properties represent your data, and how to define them.\n- Populate Weaviate with data, using batch imports.\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "Schema_and_imports Wrap_up", "path": "developers/academy/py/zero_to_mvp/103_schema_and_imports/90_wrap_up.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/py/zero_to_mvp/schema_and_imports/wrap_up", "timestamp": "2024-05-08 10:48:46", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
