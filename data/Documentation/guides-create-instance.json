{"text": "\n## Overview\n\nThis page will show you how to create a Weaviate instance on Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS).\n\n### Preparation\n\n- You will need a WCS account.\n- We offer WCS instances at different service level access (SLA) tiers, including a free \"sandbox\" tier. Please review their details and pricing here and select one that suits you best.\n\n\n\n\n## Instance creation steps\n\n1. Visit the WCS dashboard under your WCS account.\n1. Select your preferred SLA tier.\n    1. In order to create a paid-tier (i.e. non-sandbox) instance, you must first add your billing info in WCS. We will contact you separately to arrange billing.\n1. Enter a unique instance name (note: this is **not** the same as your instance URL).\n1. Select (if applicable):\n    1. Whether to enable authentication, and\n    1. The host region.\n1. Lastly, when you are ready - click \"Create\" to create your cluster.\n\n## Important notes\n\n### Authentication\n\nWCS instances are typically configured with authentication enabled, except for sandboxes, for which authentication is optional.\n\nPlease see our authentication page for instructions and tips on how to authenticate against a WCS instance.\n\n### Instance version update\n\nAs later versions of Weaviate are released, you will have the ability to update your WCS instance to run on a later version.\n\nPlease note that due to testing and configuration work required in incorporating a version of Weaviate onto WCS, there may be a small delay between the release of a new Weaviate version and its availability on WCS.\n\n## More resources\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "guides-create-instance", "path": "developers/wcs/guides/create-instance.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/guides/create-instance", "timestamp": "2023-11-13 10:39:54", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
