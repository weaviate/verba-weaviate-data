{"text": "\nWe include brief guidelines below for submitting bug reports. These guidelines are designed to make it easier for the maintainers and the community to understand the report and to quash that bug.\n\n## How to write bug reports\n\nBug reports are tracked as GitHub issues, such as these in Weaviate core].\n\nOnce you've determined which repository your bug is related to, check first for a duplicate WIP (work in progress) issue.\n\nIf not, open an issue in that repository with **a complete, specific and accurate description**. We recommend using this template.\n\n* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue.\n* **Describe the exact steps** needed to reproduce the problem with as much detail as possible. For example, include any custom Weaviate configurations, modules used or shell commands.\n* **Give specific examples** to show the bug. This could be links or code snippets. For snippets, Markdown code blocks are better than images or animated GIFs.\n* Explain what **you expected to see instead** and why.\n* (If relevant) **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.\n* If the problem was not caused by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem occurred and any additional information which may help to reproduce or identify the problem.\n\n## Read more\n\nWe also encourage you to check out this more detailed guide on Writing great Bug Reports from our team.\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "getting-started-reporting-bugs", "path": "developers/contributor-guide/getting-started/reporting-bugs.md", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/contributor-guide/getting-started/reporting-bugs", "timestamp": "2023-11-13 10:39:43", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
