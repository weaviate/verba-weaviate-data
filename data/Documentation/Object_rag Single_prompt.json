{"text": "\nA 'single prompt' generation wil perform RAG queries on each retrieved object. This is useful when you want to transform each object separately, with the same prompt.\n\n###  Code\n\nThis example finds entries in \"Movie\" based on their similarity to the input vector. Then, instructs the large language model to translate the title of each movie into French.\n\nEach of the results are then printed out to the console.\n\n\n\n##  Explain the code\n\nYou must pass on one or more properties to the `single_prompt` parameter through braces, as we've done here with `\"... {title} ...\"`. This will instruct Weaviate to pass on the `title` property from each retrieved object to the large language model.\n\n\n  Example results\n\n```text\nIn Time\n\u00c0 temps\nGattaca\nGattaca\nI, Robot\nJe, Robot\nMad Max: Fury Road\nMad Max: Fury Road\nThe Maze Runner\nLe Labyrinthe\n```\n\n\n\n###  Response object\n\nEach response object is similar to that from a regular search query, with an additional `generated` attribute. This attribute will contain the generated output for each object.\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "Object_rag Single_prompt", "path": "developers/academy/py/starter_custom_vectors/104_object_rag/20_single_prompt.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/py/starter_custom_vectors/object_rag/single_prompt", "timestamp": "2024-05-08 10:48:00", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
