You will learn how to search through that data using multimodal search methods, as well as filters. You will also learn how to use Weaviate's retrieval augmented generation (RAG) capabilities to generate outputs based on the retrieved objects.\n\n##  Learning objectives\n\n\n\n##  Units\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "Py Starter_multimodal_data", "path": "developers/academy/py/starter_multimodal_data/index.md", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/py/starter_multimodal_data", "timestamp": "2024-05-08 10:48:11", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
