{"text": "\nHere, we'll perform basic operations to communicate with Weaviate using the Python client library.\n\n###  Check Weaviate status\n\nYou can check whether the Weaviate instance is up using the `is_live` function.\n\n\n\n###  Retrieve server meta information\n\nYou can retrieve meta information about the Weaviate instance using the `meta` function.\n\n\n\nThis will print the server meta information to the console. The output will look similar to the following:\n\n\n  Example get_meta output\n\n\n\n\n###  Close the connection\n\nAfter you have finished using the Weaviate client, you should close the connection. This frees up resources and ensures that the connection is properly closed.\n\nWe suggest using a `try`-`finally` block as a best practice. For brevity, we will not include the `try`-`finally` blocks in the remaining code snippets.\n\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "Setup_weaviate Communicate", "path": "developers/academy/py/starter_text_data/101_setup_weaviate/30_communicate.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/py/starter_text_data/setup_weaviate/communicate", "timestamp": "2024-05-08 10:48:13", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
