{"text": "\nWeaviate is available as a hosted service, [Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS)](https://console.weaviate.cloud/), or as a self managed instance. If you manage your own instance, you can host it locally or with a cloud provider. Self-managed instances use the same Weaviate core database as WCS.\n\n## Installation methods\n\nTo install and configure Weaviate, see the following:\n\n- **[Weaviate Cloud Services](../../wcs/quickstart.mdx)**: This managed service works well for both development and production environments.\n- **[Docker Compose](./docker-compose.md#starter-docker-compose-file)**: Docker containers are well suited for development and testing.\n- **[Kubernetes](./kubernetes.md)**: Kubernetes is ideal for scalable, production deployments.\n- **[AWS Marketplace](./aws-marketplace.md)**: Deploy Weaviate directly from the AWS Marketplace.\n- **[Google Cloud Marketplace](./gc-marketplace.md)** Deploy Weaviate directly from the Google Cloud Marketplace.\n- **[Snowpark Container Services](./spcs-integration.mdx)** Deploy Weaviate in Snowflake's Snowpark environment.\n- **[Embedded Weaviate](./embedded.md)**: Experimental. Embedded Weaviate is a client based tool.\n\n\n## Configuration files\n\nDocker Compose and Kubernetes use yaml files to configure Weaviate instances. Docker uses the [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.md#starter-docker-compose-file) file. Kubernetes relies on [Helm charts](./kubernetes.md#weaviate-helm-chart) and the `values.yaml` file. The Weaviate documentation also calls these files `configuration yaml files`.\n\nIf you are self-hosting, consider experimenting on a small scale with Docker and then transferring your configuration to Kubernetes Helm charts when you are more familiar with Weaviate.\n\n## Unreleased versions\n\nimport RunUnreleasedImages from '/_includes/configuration/run-unreleased.mdx'\n\n\n\nWhen try out upcoming features, please provide [feedback](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate/issues/new/choose). Your comments are appreciated and help us to make Weaviate more useful for you.\n\n## Related pages\n- [Connect to Weaviate](../starter-guides/connect.mdx)\n- [Weaviate Quickstart](../quickstart/index.md)\n- [Weaviate Cloud Services Quickstart](../../wcs/quickstart.mdx)\n- [References: Configuration](../configuration/index.md)\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "Weaviate Installation", "path": "developers/weaviate/installation/index.md", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation", "timestamp": "2024-05-08 10:50:06", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
