{"text": "\nThe TypeScript client supports code that is written in TypeScript or JavaScript.\n\nThe upcoming [TypeScript client v3](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/typescript-v3) supports `Node.js` server based development. It does not support browser based web client development. To develop a browser based application, use the [v2 client](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/typescript-v2).\n\n## Clients\n\nThe current [v2 client](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/typescript-v2) version is `v||site.typescript_client_version||`.\n\nThe [v3 client](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/typescript-v3) is available as a release candidate (RC).\n\nIf you have suggestions or comments on how to improve the new client, let us know:\n\n- [Community forum](https://forum.weaviate.io) \n- [GitHub](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate)\n- [Slack](https://weaviate.io/slack)\n\n\n## Older clients\n\nThe TypeScript client replaces the [JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/weaviate-client) only client. The JavaScript client is no longer supported. If you have older code that uses the JavaScript client, update to the TypeScript client.\n\n## Client releases\n\n\n\n## Client change logs\n\nSee the client [change logs on GitHub](https://github.com/weaviate/typescript-client/releases).\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "Client-libraries Typescript", "path": "developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript/index.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript", "timestamp": "2024-05-08 10:49:39", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
