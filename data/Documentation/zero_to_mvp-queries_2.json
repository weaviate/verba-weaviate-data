{"text": "\n## &nbsp;&nbsp;Unit overview\n\n\n[//]: # ()\n\n\n\nIn this unit, you will learn about even more types of queries that you can run with Weaviate.\n\nWe will start by looking how to use keyword searches with the BM25F ranking algorithm, as well as hybrid searches that combines keyword searches with vector searches.\n\nThen, we will look at generative searches and question and answer (QnA) searches. These searches allow you to not only retrieve data objects, but to transform the results before returning them to you.\n\nBy the end of this unit, you will have a suite of query types to choose from, so that you can retrieve the right information in the form that you want.\n\nLet's get started.\n\n### &nbsp;&nbsp;Prerequisites\n\n- (**Required**) A Python (3) environment with `weaviate-client` installed.\n- (**Required**) Complete 101A Weaviate Academy Preparation\n- (*Recommended*) Complete Hello, Weaviate\n- (*Recommended*) Complete Queries 1\n- (*Recommended*) Complete Schema and Imports\n\n## &nbsp;&nbsp;Learning objectives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "zero_to_mvp-queries_2", "path": "developers/academy/zero_to_mvp/104_queries_2/index.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/zero_to_mvp/queries_2", "timestamp": "2024-02-08 20:21:33", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
