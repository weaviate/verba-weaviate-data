Storing data in a vector-first manner not only allows for semantic or context-based search, but also makes it possible to store *very* large amounts of data without decreasing performance (assuming scaled well horizontally or having sufficient shards for the indices).\n\n## Why index data as vectors?\nNow, a long list of numbers does not carry any meaning by itself. But if the numbers in this list are chosen to indicate the semantic similarity between the data objects represented by other vectors, then the new vector contains information about the data object's meaning and relation to other data.\n\nTo make this concept more tangible, think of vectors as coordinates in a *n*-dimensional space. For example, we can represent *words* in a 2-dimensional space. If you use an algorithm that learned the relations of words or co-occurrence statistics between words from a corpus (like GloVe), then single words can be given the coordinates (vectors) according to their similarity to other words. These algorithms are powered by Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing concepts. In the picture below, you see how this concept looks (simplified). The words `Apple` and `Banana` are close to each other. The distance between those words, given by the distance between the vectors, is small. But these two fruits are further away from the words `Newspaper` and `Magazine`.\n\n2D Vectors visualization\n\nAnother way to think of this is how products are placed in a supermarket. You'd expect to find `Apples` close to `Bananas`, because they are both fruit. But when you are searching for a `Magazine`, you would move away from the `Apples` and `Bananas`, more towards the aisle with, for example, `Newspapers`. This is how the semantics of concepts can be stored in Weaviate as well, depending on the module you're using to calculate the numbers in the vectors. Not only words or text can be indexed as vectors, but also images, video, DNA sequences, etc. Read more about which model to use here.\n\nSupermarket map visualization\n\n## How to choose the right vector index type\n\nThe first vector-storage type Weaviate supports is HNSW, which is also the default vector index type. Typical for HNSW is that this index type is super fast at query time, but more costly when it comes to the building process (adding data with vectors). If your use case values fast data upload higher than super fast query time and high scalability, then other vector index types may be a better solution (e.g. Spotify's Annoy). If you want to contribute to a new index type, you can always contact us or make a pull request to Weaviate and build your own index type. Stay tuned for updates!\n\n## Configuration of vector index type\n\nThe index type can be specified per data class via the class definition. Currently the only index type is HNSW.\n\nExample of a class vector index configuration in your data schema:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"class\": \"Article\",\n  \"description\": \"string\",\n  \"properties\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"title\",\n      \"description\": \"string\",\n      \"dataType\": [\"text\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"vectorIndexType\": \" ... \",\n  \"vectorIndexConfig\": { ... }\n}\n```\n\nNote that the vector index type only specifies how the vectors of data objects are *indexed* and this is used for data retrieval and similarity search. How the data vectors are determined (which numbers the vectors contain) is specified by the `\"vectorizer\"` parameter which points to a module such as `\"text2vec-contextionary\"` (or to `\"none\"` if you want to import your own vectors). Learn more about all parameters in the data schema here.\n\n## Can Weaviate support multiple vector index (ANN) types?\n\n* The short answer: _yes_\n* The longer answer: currently, we have a custom implementation of HNSW to have full CRUD-support in Weaviate. In principle, if an ANN algorithm allows for full CRUD support, Weaviate can support it. If you have ideas, suggestions, or plans (e.g., for a research project) for another ANN index type besides HNSW, please let us know in our forum.\n\n\n## HNSW\nHNSW is the first vector index type supported by Weaviate.\n\n### What is HNSW?\nHNSW stands for Hierarchical Navigable Small World, a multilayered graph. Every object that is in the database, are captured in the lowest layer (layer 0 in the picture). These data objects are very well connected. On each layer on top of the lowest layer, there are fewer data points represented. These datapoints match with lower layers, but there are exponentially fewer points in each higher layer. If a search query comes in, the closest datapoints will be found in the highest layer. In the example below that is only one more datapoint. Then it goes one layer deeper, and finds the closest datapoints from the first found datapoint in the highest layer, and searches nearest neighbors from there. In the deepest layer, the actual closest data object to the search query will be found.\n\nIf there were no hierarchical layers in this approach, only the deepest layer (0) would be present and significantly more datapoints would have needed to be explored from the search query, since all data objects are present there. In higher layers, with less datapoints, fewer hops between datapoints need to be made, over larger distances. HNSW is a very fast and memory efficient approach of similarity search, because only the highest layer (top layer) is kept in cache instead of all the datapoints in the lowest layer. Only the datapoints that are closest to the search query are loaded once they are requested by a higher layer, which means that only a small amount of memory needs to be reserved.\n\nThe picture shows how a HNSW algorithm is used to go from a search query vector (blue) on the top layer to the closes search result (green) in the lowest layer. Only three data hops are made (indicated by blue solid arrows), whereas more data objects would have need to be search through when this layering was not present (the closest datapoint of *all* datapoints in each layer needs to be found).h\n\nHNSW layers\n\n### Distance metrics\n\nAll distance metrics supported in Weaviate are also supported with the HNSW index type.\n\n## HNSW with Product Quantization (PQ)\n\nWhen using HNSW you can also choose to also enable product quantization (PQ) to reduce memory costs. Product quantization is a technique for representing an approximation of a vector using fewer bytes. As HNSW stores vectors in memory, this allows for running larger datasets with a given amount of memory.\n\nAn important point to note is that product quantization is a tradeoff between recall, performance, and memory usage. This means that configuration settings reducing memory may also reduce recall. This is similar to how HNSW can be tuned to lower latency at the cost of recall by configuring its search parameters (`ef` and `maxConnections`). Please refer to Configuration: Indexes for more information about how to configure HNSW.\n\n### What is Product Quantization?\n\nQuantization is the approach of representing a range of vectors with a finite smaller set of vectors. A familiar example for a single numeric value is rounding the number to the nearest integer.\n\nProduct quantization is a technique where the vector is first represented as a product of smaller vectors (named segments or subspaces) and then each segment is quantized independently.\n\nPQ illustrated\n\nFrom the segments a training step occurs where centroids are calculated per segment and stored as a codebook. By default Weaviate will cluster each segment into 256 centroids.\n\nOnce this codebook is calculated a vector can now instead be represented by the id of the closest centroid to each of its segments.\nWith this new representation, memory is reduced considerably as instead of say `768 x 4 = 3072` bytes per vector (with 4 byte floating points), only `128 x 1 = 128` bytes\nper vector are required plus the small size of the codebook.\n\n### Distance calculation and rescoring\n\nWith product quantization distances are then calculated asymmetrically with a query vector with the goal being to keep all the original information in the query vector when calculating distances.\n\nAdditionally as Weaviate has the original vectors stored on disk, rescoring will occur when using product quantization. After HNSW PQ has produced the candidate vectors from a search the original vectors will be fetched from disk improving recall. Rescoring occurs by default.\n\n### Segments\n\nThe PQ `segments` controls the tradeoff between memory and recall. A larger `segments` parameter means higher memory usage and recall. An important thing to note is that the segments must divide evenly the original vector dimension.\n\nBelow is a list segment values for common vectorizer modules:\n\n| Module      | Model                                   | Dimensions | Segments               |\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------|------------|------------------------|\n| openai      | text-embedding-ada-002                  | 1536       | 512, 384, 256, 192, 96 |\n| cohere      | multilingual-22-12                      | 768        | 384, 256, 192, 96      |\n| huggingface | sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2 | 384        | 192, 128, 96           |\n\n### Conversion of an existing Class to use PQ\n\nTo use PQ, we recommend using Weaviate 1.20.5 or higher.\n\nYou can convert an existing class to use product quantization by updating the vector index configuration. It is recommended to run a backup first before enabling if you are in production and may want to roll back.\n\nAs PQ has a training stage, data must already exist in the class prior to enabling. To reduce training times you can also use the `trainingLimit` parameter.\n\n```python\nclient.schema.update_config(\"DeepImage\", {\n  \"vectorIndexConfig\": {\n    \"pq\": {\n      \"enabled\": True,\n      \"trainingLimit\": 100000,\n      \"segments\": 0 # see above section for recommended values\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nTo learn more about other configuration settings for PQ refer to the documentation in Configuration: Indexes\n\nThe command will return immediately and a job will run in the background to convert an index. During this time the index will be read-only. Shard status will return to `READY` after conversion.\n\n```python\nclient.schema.get_class_shards(\"DeepImage\")\n\n[{'name': '1Gho094Wev7i', 'status': 'READONLY'}]\n```\n\nYou can now query and write to the index as normal. Distances may be slightly different due to the effects of quantization.\n\n```python\nclient.query.get(\"DeepImage\", [\"i\"]) \\\n\t.with_near_vector({\"vector\": vector}) \\\n\t.with_additional([\"distance\"]) \\\n\t.with_limit(10).do()\n\n{'data': {'Get': {'DeepImage': [{'_additional': {'distance': 0.18367815},\n     'i': 64437},\n    {'_additional': {'distance': 0.18895388}, 'i': 97342},\n    {'_additional': {'distance': 0.19454134}, 'i': 14852},\n    {'_additional': {'distance': 0.20019263}, 'i': 84393},\n    {'_additional': {'distance': 0.20580399}, 'i': 71091},\n    {'_additional': {'distance': 0.2110992}, 'i': 15182},\n    {'_additional': {'distance': 0.2117207}, 'i': 92370},\n    {'_additional': {'distance': 0.21241724}, 'i': 98583},\n    {'_additional': {'distance': 0.21241736}, 'i': 8064},\n    {'_additional': {'distance': 0.21257097}, 'i': 537}]}}}\n```\n\n### Encoders\nIn the configuration above you can see that you can set the `encoder` object to specify how the codebook centroids are generated. Weaviate\u2019s PQ supports using two different encoders. The default is `kmeans` which maps to the traditional approach used for creating centroid.\n\nAlternatively, there is also the `tile` encoder. This encoder is currently experimental but does have faster import times and better recall on datasets like SIFT and GIST. The `tile` encoder has an additional `distribution` parameter that controls what distribution to use when generating centroids. You can configure the encoder by setting `type` to `tile` or `kmeans` the encoder creates the codebook for product quantization.
