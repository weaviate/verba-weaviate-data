Without any vectorizer modules attached, Weaviate does not know how to *vectorize* an object, i.e. *how* to calculate the vectors given an object.\n\nDepending on the type of data you want to store and search (text, images, etc.), and depending on the use case (like search, question answering, etc., depending on language, classification, ML model, training set, etc.), you can choose and attach a vectorizer module that best fits your use case. Or, you can \"bring your own\" vectors to Weaviate.\n\n## Available module types\n\nThis graphic shows the available modules of the latest Weaviate version (v||site.weaviate_version||).\n\nBroadly, we categorize them into one of:\n- Vectorization modules,\n- Vectorization + additional functionality modules, and\n- Other modules\n\nWeaviate module ecosystem\n\n### Vectorizer & Ranker modules\n\nVectorizer modules, like the `text2vec-*`, `multi2vec-*` or `img2vec-*` modules, transform data into vectors. Ranker modules, like the `rerank-*` modules, rank the results.\n\n### Reader & Generator modules\n\nReader or Generator modules can be used on top of a Vectorizer module. These modules take the set of relevant documents that are retrieved, and performs another operation, such as question answering, or a generative task. An example Reader module is `qna-transformers` module, which extracts an answer directly from a document. A Generator module would, on the other hand, use *language generation* to generate an answer from the given document.\n\n### Other modules\n\nThese include those such as `gcs-backup` or `text-spellcheck`.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nModules can be dependent on other modules to be present. For example, to use the `qna-transformers` module, *exactly one* text vectorization module is required.\n\n## Weaviate without modules\n\nWeaviate can also be used without any modules, as pure vector native database and search engine. If you choose not to include any modules, you will need to enter a vector for each data entry. You can then search through the objects by a vector as well.\n\n## Custom modules\n\nIt is possible for anyone to create a custom module for use with Weaviate.
