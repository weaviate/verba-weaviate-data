For example, to list the first ten results, set `limit: 10`. Then, to \"display the second page of 10\", set `offset: 10`, `limit:10` and so on. E.g. to show the 9th page of 10 results, set `offset: 80, limit: 10` to effectively display results 81-90.\n\nHere's an example of `limit` + `offset`:\n\n\n\n\n\n  Expected response\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"Get\": {\n      \"Article\": [\n        {\n          \"title\": \"Through a cloud, brightly - Obituary: Paul Volcker died on December 8th\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"title\": \"Google Stadia Reviewed \\u2013 Against The Stream\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"title\": \"Managing Supply Chain Risk\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"title\": \"Playing College Football In Madden\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"title\": \"The 50 best albums of 2019, No 3: Billie Eilish \\u2013 When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Performance and resource considerations & limitations\n\nThe pagination implementation is an offset-based implementation, not a cursor-based implementation. This has the following implications:\n\n- The cost of retrieving one further page is higher than that of the last. Effectively when searching for search results 91-100, Weaviate will internally retrieve 100 search results and discard results 0-90 before serving them to the user. This effect is amplified if running in a multi-shard setup, where each shard would retrieve 100 results, then the results aggregated and ultimately cut off. So in a 10-shard setup asking for results 91-100 Weaviate will effectively have to retrieve 1000 results (100 per shard) and discard 990 of them before serving. This means, high page numbers lead to longer response times and more load on the machine/cluster.\n- Due to the increasing cost of each page outlined above, there is a limit to how many objects can be retrieved using pagination. By default setting the sum of `offset` and `limit` to higher than 10,000 objects, will lead to an error. If you must retrieve more than 10,000 objects, you can increase this limit by setting the environment variable `QUERY_MAXIMUM_RESULTS=`. Warning: Setting this to arbitrarily high values can make the memory consumption of a single query explode and single queries can slow down the entire cluster. We recommend setting this value to the lowest possible value that does not interfere with your users' expectations.\n- The pagination setup is not stateful. If the database state has changed between retrieving two pages there is no guarantee that your pages cover all results. If no writes happened, then pagination can be used to retrieve all possible within the maximum limit. This means asking for a single page of 10,000 objects will lead to the same results overall as asking for 100 pages of 100 results.\n\n\n## Autocut\n\nStarting with Weaviate `v1.20`, the `autocut` filter can be added as an argument to class objects retrieved via the `nearXXX`, `bm25` and `hybrid` operators. `autocut: `, where N is an integer > 0, limits the number of results to those up to the Nth \"jump\"/\"drop\" in the distance/score from the query. For example, if the distances for six objects returned by `nearText` were `[0.1899, 0.1901, 0.191, 0.21, 0.215, 0.23]` then `autocut: 1` would return the first three objects, `autocut: 2` would return all but the last object, and `autocut: 3` would return all objects. Autocut is disabled by default, and can be disabled explicitly by setting its value to `0` or a negative number.\n\nIf `autocut` is combined with `limit: N`, then `autocut`'s input will be limited to the first `N` objects.\n\n\n\nAutocut can be used as follows:\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  Example response\n\nIt should produce a response like the one below:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more client code examples for each operator category, see autocut with similarity search, autocut with `bm25` and autocut with `hybrid`.\n\n\n## Cursor with `after`\n\nStarting with version `v1.18`, the `after` operator can be used to sequentially retrieve class objects from Weaviate. This may be useful for retrieving an entire set of objects from Weaviate, for example.\n\nThe `after` operator relies on the order of ids. It can therefore only be applied to list queries without any search operators. In other words, `after` is not compatible with `where`, `near`, `bm25`, `hybrid`, etc.\n\nFor those cases, use pagination with `offset`.\n\nAn example of the `after` operator usage:\n\n\n\n\n\n  Expected response\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"Get\": {\n      \"Article\": [\n        {\n          \"_additional\": {\n            \"id\": \"00313a4c-4308-30b0-af4a-01773ad1752b\"\n          },\n          \"title\": \"Managing Supply Chain Risk\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"_additional\": {\n            \"id\": \"0042b9d0-20e4-334e-8f42-f297c150e8df\"\n          },\n          \"title\": \"Playing College Football In Madden\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"_additional\": {\n            \"id\": \"0047c049-cdd6-3f6e-bb89-84ae20b74f49\"\n          },\n          \"title\": \"The 50 best albums of 2019, No 3: Billie Eilish \\u2013 When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"_additional\": {\n            \"id\": \"00582185-cbf4-3cd6-8c59-c2d6ec979282\"\n          },\n          \"title\": \"How artificial intelligence is transforming the global battle against human trafficking\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"_additional\": {\n            \"id\": \"0061592e-b776-33f9-8109-88a5bd41df78\"\n          },\n          \"title\": \"Masculine, feminist or neutral? The language battle that has split Spain\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n\nThe `after` cursor is available on both single-shard and multi-shard set-ups.\n\n\n## Sorting\n\nSupport for sorting was added in `v1.13.0`.\n\nYou can sort results by any primitive property, such as a `text`, `string`,\n`number`, or `int`. When a query has a natural order (e.g. because of a\n`near` vector search), adding a sort operator will override the order.\n\n\n### Cost of sorting / architecture\n\nWeaviate's sorting implementation is built in a way that it does not lead to massive memory spikes; it does not need to load all objects to be sorted into memory completely. Only the property value being sorted is kept in memory.\n\nAs of now, Weaviate does not have any data structures on disk specific to sorting, such as a column-oriented storage mechanism. As a result when an object should be sorted, the whole object is identified on disk and the relevant property extracted. This works reasonably well for small scales (100s of thousand or millions), but comes with a high cost at large lists of objects to be sorted (100s of millions, billions).  A column-oriented storage mechanism may be introduced in the future to  overcome this performance limitation.\n\n### Sorting decisions\n\n#### booleans order\n`false` is considered smaller than `true`. `false` comes before `true` in ascending order and after `true` in descending order.\n\n#### nulls order\n`null` values are considered smaller than any non-`null` values. `null` values come first in ascending order and last in descending order.\n\n#### arrays order\nArrays are compared by each element separately. Elements at the same position are compared to each other, starting from the beginning of an array. First element smaller than its counterpart makes whole array smaller.\n\nArrays are equal if they have the same size and all elements are equal. If array is subset of other array it is considered smaller.\n\nExamples:\n- `[1, 2, 3] = [1, 2, 3]`\n- `[1, 2, 4]  [1, 2, 3, 4]`\n- `[1, 2, 3] \n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n  Expected response\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"Get\": {\n      \"JeopardyQuestion\": [\n        {\n          \"answer\": \"$5 (Lincoln Memorial in the background)\",\n          \"points\": 600,\n          \"question\": \"A sculpture by Daniel Chester French can be seen if you look carefully on the back of this current U.S. bill\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"answer\": \"(1 of 2) Juneau, Alaska or Augusta, Maine\",\n          \"points\": 0,\n          \"question\": \"1 of the 2 U.S. state capitals that begin with the names of months\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"answer\": \"(1 of 2) Juneau, Alaska or Honolulu, Hawaii\",\n          \"points\": 0,\n          \"question\": \"One of the 2 state capitals whose names end with the letter \\\"U\\\"\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n#### Sorting by multiple properties\n\nTo sort by more than one property, pass an array of { `path`, `order` } objects to the sort operator:\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n#### Additional properties\n\nSometimes sorting by an additional property is required, such as `id`, `creationTimeUnix`, or `lastUpdateTimeUnix`.  This can be achieved by prefixing the property name with an underscore.\n\nFor example:\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "graphql-additional-operators", "path": "developers/weaviate/api/graphql/additional-operators.md", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/api/graphql/additional-operators", "timestamp": "2023-11-13 10:40:01", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
