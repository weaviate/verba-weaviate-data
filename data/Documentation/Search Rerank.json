{"text": "\nReranking modules reorder the search result set according to a different set of criteria or a different (e.g. more expensive) algorithm.\n\n\n  \n    Additional information\n  \n\n**Configure reranking**\n\nTo rerank search results, enable a reranker [module](../configuration/modules.md) for your collection. For details, see the reranker's reference page:\n\n- [reranker-cohere](../modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/reranker-cohere.md)\n- [reranker-transformers](../modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/reranker-transformers.md)\n\nA collection can have multiple rerankers. If multiple `reranker` modules are enabled, specify the module you want to use in the `moduleConfig` section of your schema.\n\n\n\n## Named vectors\n\n\nAny vector-based search on collections with [named vectors](../config-refs/schema/multi-vector.md) configured must include a `target` vector name in the query. This allows Weaviate to find the correct vector to compare with the query vector.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n## Rerank vector search results\n\nTo rerank the results of a vector search, configure the object properties to sort on.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  Example response\n\nThe response should look like this:\n\n  \n\n\n\n## Rerank keyword search results\n\nTo rerank the results of a keyword search, configure the object properties to sort on.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  Example response\n\nThe response should look like this:\n\n  \n\n\n\n## Related pages\n\n- [Connect to Weaviate](/developers/weaviate/starter-guides/connect.mdx)\n- [API References: GraphQL - Additional properties](../api/graphql/additional-properties.md#rerank)\n- [API References: GraphQL - Sorting](/developers/weaviate/api/graphql/additional-operators#sorting-api)\n- [Concepts: Reranking](../concepts/reranking.md)\n- [References: Modules: reranker-cohere](../modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/reranker-cohere.md)\n- [References: Modules: reranker-transformers](../modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/reranker-transformers.md)\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "Search Rerank", "path": "developers/weaviate/search/rerank.md", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search/rerank", "timestamp": "2024-05-08 10:50:55", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
