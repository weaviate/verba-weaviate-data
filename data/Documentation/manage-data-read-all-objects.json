This is useful when you want to manually copy/migrate your data (and vector embeddings) from one place to another.\n\nThis is done with the help of the `after` operator, also called the cursor API.\n\nThe new API clients (currently supported by the Python Client v4), encapsulate this functionality as an `Iterator`.\n\n## Read object properties and ids\n\nThe following code iterates through all objects, providing the properties and id for each object.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n## Read all objects including vectors\n\nRead through all data including `vector embeddings`.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n## Read all objects - Multi-tenant collections\n\nIterate through all tenenats and read data for each.\n\nFor classes where multi-tenancy is enabled, you need to specify the tenant name when reading or creating objects.
