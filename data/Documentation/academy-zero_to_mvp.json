{"text": "\nimport { courseData } from '/src/components/Academy/courseData.js'\n\n## &nbsp;&nbsp;Course overview\n\nThis course is designed to get you started with Weaviate, so that you can go from being new to Weaviate to building an MVP-level product with Weaviate in a short period of time.\n\nAlong the way, you'll develop intuitions about not only how Weaviate works, but also how vectors work, and how vector searches work. You'll also learn how to use Weaviate's client library so that you can get going in a language that you are familiar with.\n\nBy the time you're done with these short units, you'll be able to build your own instance of Weaviate with your own data, and have a suite of search tools at your disposal so that you can get the data you want in the format you want it.\n\n## &nbsp;&nbsp;Learning objectives\n\n\n\n## &nbsp;&nbsp;Units\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "academy-zero_to_mvp", "path": "developers/academy/zero_to_mvp/index.md", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/zero_to_mvp", "timestamp": "2023-11-13 10:39:38", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
