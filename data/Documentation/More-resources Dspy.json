{"text": "[DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) is a framework for programming language models created by Stanford NLP. DSPy introduces two key concepts: **programming model** and **optimizers**.\n\n- **Programing model**: The programming model lets you define a series of components that make a language model request. Components include input and output fields, task descriptions, and calls to a vector database like Weaviate.\n\n- **Optimizers**: Optimizers compile your DSPy program to tune the language model prompt and/or the weights.\n\n## DSPy and Weaviate\n\nWeaviate is integrated with DSPy through the retriever module! You only need to connect to your Weaviate cluster through [WCS](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) or localhost, and pass in your collection:\n\n```python\nweaviate_client = weaviate.Client(\"http://localhost:8080\") # or pass in your WCS cluster url\n\nretriever_module = WeaviateRM(\"WeaviateBlogChunk\", # collection name\n                    weaviate_client=weaviate_client)\n```\n\n## Our Resources \nHere are a few resources on using DSPy from the Weaviate team!\n\nThe resources are broken into two categories: \n1. [**Hands on Learning**](#hands-on-learning): Content framed to build your technical understanding with end-to-end tutorials. \n\n2. [**Read and Listen**](#read-and-listen): Content designed to help develop your conceptual understanding of these technologies.\n\n\n### Hands on Learning \n\n| Topic | Details |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Getting Started with RAG in DSPy** | Learn about the four components needed to build a DSPy program: Installation, settings, datasets with `dspy.Example`, LLM metrics, DSPy programming model, and optimization.
