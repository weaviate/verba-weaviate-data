{"text": "\n\n\nThe `Explore` function is disabled where multiple inference modules are enabled. This includes Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS)\n\n\n## Overview\n\nUse `Explore` to perform vector searches across multiple collections. Note that `Explore` is currently not available in the gRPC API.\n\n### Requirements\n\nFor `Explore`:\n\n- The Weaviate instance to be configured with a maximum of one vectorizer (e.g. `text2vec-transformers`, `text2vec-openai`) module.\n- Each `Explore` query can only be a vector search using `nearText` or `nearVector`.\n\n## `Explore` queries\n\n### `Explore` structure and syntax\n\nThe `Explore` function has the following syntax:\n\n```graphql\n{\n  Explore (\n    limit: ,              # The maximum amount of objects to return\n    nearText: {                # Either this or 'nearVector' is required\n      concepts: []!,   # Required - An array of search items. If the text2vec-contextionary is the vectorization module, the concepts should be present in the Contextionary.\n      certainty: ,      # Minimal level of certainty, computed by normalized distance\n      moveTo: {                # Optional - Giving directions to the search\n        concepts: []!, # List of search items\n        force: !        # The force to apply for a particular movement. Must be between 0 (no movement) and 1 (largest possible movement).\n      },\n      moveAwayFrom: {          # Optional - Giving directions to the search\n        concepts: []!, # List of search items\n        force: !        # The force to apply for a particular movement. Must be between 0 (no movement) and 1 (largest possible movement).\n      }\n    },\n    nearVector: {              # Either this or 'nearText' is required\n      vector: []!,      # Required - An array of search items, which length should match the vector space\n      certainty:        # Minimal level of certainty, computed by normalized distance\n    }\n  ) {\n    beacon\n    certainty                  # certainty value based on a normalized distance calculation\n    className\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAn example query:\n\n\n\n\nThe result might look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"Explore\": [\n      {\n        \"beacon\": \"weaviate://localhost/7e9b9ffe-e645-302d-9d94-517670623b35\",\n        \"certainty\": 0.975523,\n        \"className\": \"Publication\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"errors\": null\n}\n```\n\n### Search operators\n\nThe `nearText` and `nearVector` operators work in `Explore` as they do in other queries. See search operators for more information.\n\n\n### Filters\n\n`Explore` queries can be combined with filters. See filters for more information.\n\n\n### Pagination\n\nPagination (i.e. `limit` with `offset`) is not possible in `Explore` queries.\n\n#### Moving\n\nBecause pagination is not possible in multidimensional storage, we recommend using `moveTo` and `moveAwayFrom` if further query refinement is sought. They work as they do in other queries. See search operators#nearText for more information.\n\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "graphql-explore", "path": "developers/weaviate/api/graphql/explore.md", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/api/graphql/explore", "timestamp": "2024-02-08 20:22:11", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
