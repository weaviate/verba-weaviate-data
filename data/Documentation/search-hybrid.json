You can set the weights or the ranking method.\n\n## Basic hybrid search\n\nCombines results of a vector search and a keyword search based on the query string.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Example response\n\nThe output is like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n## Explain the search results\n\nUse the metadata properties to understand why an object is selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Example response\n\nThe output is like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n## Balance keyword and vector search\n\nUse the `alpha` argument to change how much each search affects the results.\n\n- An `alpha` of `1` is a pure vector search.\n- An `alpha` of `0` is a pure keyword search.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Example response\n\nThe output is like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n## Change the ranking method\n\n\n`Ranked Fusion` is the default fusion algorithm.\n\n- To use objects' keyword and vector search scores instead of ranks, use `Relative Score Fusion`.\n- To use autocut with the `hybrid` operator, use `Relative Score Fusion`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Example response\n\nThe output is like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Additional information\n  \n\nFor a discussion of fusion methods, see this blog post and this reference page\n\n\n\n## Specify properties to keyword search\n\n\nThe keyword search portion of hybrid search can be directed to only search a subset of object properties. This does not affect the vector search portion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Example response\n\nThe output is like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n## Set weights on property values\n\nSpecify the relative value of an object's `properties` in the keyword search. Higher values increase the property's contribution to the search score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Example response\n\nThe output is like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n## Specify a vector\n\nTo specify a vector instead of using a vector of the query string, pass it in addition to the query string for the keyword search.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Example response\n\nThe output is like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n## `limit` & `offset`\n\nUse `limit` to set a fixed maximum number of objects to return.\n\nOptionally, use `offset` to paginate the results.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n## Limit result groups\n\nTo limit results to groups with similar distances from the query, use the `autocut` filter. Specify the `Relative Score Fusion` ranking method when you use autocut with hybrid search.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  Example response\n\nThe output is like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n## Filter results\n\nFor more specific results, use a `filter` to narrow your search.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Example response\n\nThe output is like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n## Related pages\n\n- API References: Search operators # Hybrid\n- About hybrid fusion algorithms.\n- For tutorials, see Queries.\n- For search using the GraphQL API, see GraphQL API.\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "search-hybrid", "path": "developers/weaviate/search/hybrid.md", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search/hybrid", "timestamp": "2024-02-08 21:21:58", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
