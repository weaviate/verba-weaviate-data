{"text": "\n\n\n## OpenID Configuration\n\nIf [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](/developers/weaviate/configuration/authentication.md) authentication is enabled, the endpoint returns configuration details.\n\nIf a token is configured, the endpoint redirects to it.\n\n#### Usage\n\nThe discovery endpoint accepts a `GET` request:\n\n```js\nGET /v1/.well-known/openid-configuration\n```\n\nIf there is an OIDC provider, the endpoint returns the following fields:\n- `href`: The reference to the client.\n- `cliendID`: The ID of the client.\n\nIf there is no OIDC provider, the endpoint returns a `404` HTTP status code.\n\n#### Example\n\n\n\nIf OIDC is configured, the endpoint returns a document like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"href\": \"http://my-token-issuer/auth/realms/my-weaviate-usecase\",\n  \"cliendID\": \"my-weaviate-client\"\n}\n```\n\n## Liveness\n\nThe `live` endpoint checks if the application is alive. You can use it for a Kubernetes liveness probe.\n\n#### Usage\n\nThe endpoint accepts a `GET` request:\n\n```js\nGET /v1/.well-known/live\n```\n\nThe endpoint returns HTTP status code `200` if the application is able to respond to HTTP requests.\n\n#### Example\n\n\n\nThe endpoint returns HTTP status code `200` if the application is able to respond to HTTP requests.\n\n## Readiness\n\nThe `ready` endpoint checks if the application is ready to receive traffic. You can use it for Kubernetes readiness probe.\n\n#### Usage\n\nThe discovery endpoint accepts a `GET` request:\n\n```js\nGET /v1/.well-known/ready\n```\n\nThe endpoint returns HTTP status code `200` if the application is able to respond to HTTP requests. If the application is currently unable to serve traffic, the endpoint returns HTTP status code `503`.\n\nIf the application is unavailable and you have horizontal replicas of Weaviate that can receive traffic, redirect traffic to one of the replicas.\n\n#### Example\n\n\n\nThe endpoint returns HTTP status code `200` if the application is able to respond to HTTP requests.\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "Rest_legacy Well-known", "path": "developers/weaviate/api/rest_legacy/well-known.md", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/api/rest_legacy/well-known", "timestamp": "2024-05-08 10:49:31", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
