{"text": "\n## &nbsp;&nbsp;Unit review\n\nIn this unit, you learned about additional types of queries, including keyword (BM25), hybrid, generative and QnA searches. Combined with the tools that you learned earlier in Queries 1, you are now armed with a variety of search tools.\n\nEach of these tools allow you to interrogate the data differently. Being aware of how each type works will allow you to formulate the right query for your tasks.\n\nBM25 searches for example can be used for precise keyword searches, and a hybrid search allows you to combine results of both BM25 and vector searches. Meanwhile, generative searches and QnA searches transform your data before it is delivered to the user. These searches leverage the power of language models, bringing your data to life and allowing Weaviate to go further than simple data retrieval.\n\n### &nbsp;&nbsp;Learning outcomes\n\nHaving finished this unit, you should be able to:\n- Perform BM25 and hybrid searches.\n- Differentiate between vector, BM25 and hybrid searches.\n- Transform data before delivery with generative searches.\n- Extract answers from data with QnA searches.\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "queries_2-wrap_up", "path": "developers/academy/zero_to_mvp/104_queries_2/90_wrap_up.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/zero_to_mvp/queries_2/wrap_up", "timestamp": "2023-11-02 10:51:46", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
