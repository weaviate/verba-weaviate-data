In this example, the BM25 search only uses the `question` property to produce the BM25F score.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  Example response\n\nIt should produce a response like the one below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Use weights to boost properties\n\n\nYou can weight how much each property affects the overall BM25F score. This example boosts the `question` property by a factor of 2 while the `answer` property remains static.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  Example response\n\nIt should produce a response like the one below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Set tokenization\n\nThe BM25 query string is tokenized before it is used to search for objects using the inverted index.\n\nYou must specify the tokenization method in the collection definition for each property.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n## `limit` & `offset`\n\nUse `limit` to set a fixed maximum number of objects to return.\n\nOptionally, use `offset` to paginate the results.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n## Limit result groups\n\nTo limit results to groups of similar distances to the query, use the `autocut` filter to set the number of groups to return.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  Example response\n\nIt should produce a response like the one below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Filter results\n\nFor more specific results, use a `filter` to narrow your search.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  Example response\n\nIt should produce a response like the one below:\n\n\n\n\n\n## Related pages\n\n- API References: Search operators # BM25\n\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "search-bm25", "path": "developers/weaviate/search/bm25.md", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search/bm25", "timestamp": "2024-02-08 20:23:36", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
