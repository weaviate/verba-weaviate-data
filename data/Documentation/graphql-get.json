{"text": "\n\n\n\n\n## Overview\n\n- How-to: Search: Basics\n\nThe `Get{}` function is for retrieving individual objects.\n\n## Syntax and query structure\n\nThe `Get{}` function requires the target class name, and the properties to be fetched.\n\nFor example, the following will fetch `JeopardyQuestion` objects and their `question`, `answer` and `points`  properties:\n\n\n\n\n\n  Example response\n\nThe above query will result in something like the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Order of retrieved objects\n\nWithout any arguments, the objects are retrieved according to their ID.\n\nAccordingly, such a `Get` query is not suitable for a substantive object retrieval strategy. Consider the Cursor API for that purpose.\n\n\n\n- How-to search: Basics\n\n### groupBy argument\n\nYou can use `groupBy` to retrieve groups of objects from Weaviate. The `groupBy{}` argument is structured as follows for the `Get{}` function:\n\n\n\n\n```graphql\n{\n  Get{\n    (\n        # e.g. nearVector, nearObject, nearText\n      groupBy:{\n        path: []  # Property to group by (only one property or cross-reference)\n        groups:   # Max. number of groups\n        objectsPerGroup:   # Max. number of objects per group\n      }\n    ) {\n      _additional {\n        group {\n          id  # An identifier for the group in this search\n          groupedBy{ value path }  # Value and path of the property grouped by\n          count  # Count of objects in this group\n          maxDistance  # Maximum distance from the group to the query vector\n          minDistance  # Minimum distance from the group to the query vector\n          hits {  # Where the actual properties for each grouped objects will be\n              # Properties of the individual object\n            _additional {\n              id  # UUID of the individual object\n              vector  # The vector of the individual object\n              distance  # The distance from the individual object to the query vector\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- How-to search: Basics # groupBy\n\n### Consistency levels\n\n\nWhere replication is configured, the `Get{}` function can be configured to return results with different levels of consistency. This is useful when you want to retrieve the most up-to-date data, or when you want to retrieve data as fast as possible.\n\nThe available consistency options are:\n- `ONE`\n- `QUORUM`\n- `ALL`\n\nRead more about consistency levels here.\n\n\n\n\n### Multi-tenancy\n\n\nWhere multi-tenancy is configured, the `Get{}` function can be configured to return results from a specific tenant.\n\nYou can do so by specifying the `tenant` parameter in the GraphQL query as shown below, or using the equivalent client function.\n\n```graphql\n{\n  Get {\n    Article (\n      tenant: \"tenantA\"\n      limit: 1\n    ) {\n      name\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- How-to manage data: Multi-tenancy operations\n\n## Cross-references\n\nYou can retrieve any cross-referenced properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Expected response\n\n\n\n\n\n- How-to retrieve cross-referenced properties\n\n## Additional properties / metadata\n\nVarious metadata properties may be retrieved with `Get{}` requests. They include:\n\nProperty | Description |\n-------- | ----------- |\n`id` | Object id |\n`vector` | Object vector |\n`generate` | Generative module outputs |\n`rerank` | Reranker module outputs |\n`creationTimeUnix` | Object creation time |\n`lastUpdateTimeUnix` | Object last updated time |\n`distance` | Vector distance to query (vector search only) |\n`certainty` | Vector distance to query, normalized to certainty (vector search only) |\n`score` | Search score (BM25 and hybrid only) |\n`explainScore` | Explanation of the score (BM25 and hybrid only) |\n`classification` | Classification outputs |\n`featureProjection` | Feature projection outputs |\n\nThey are returned through the `_additional` properties in the response.\n\nFor further information see:\n\n- References: GraphQL: Additional properties\n- How-to search: Specify fetched properties\n\n\n## Search operators\n\nThe following search operators are available.\n\n| Argument | Description | Required modules (at least one of) | Learn more |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `nearObject` | Vector search using a Weaviate object | *none* | Learn more |\n| `nearVector` | Vector search using a raw vector | *none* | Learn more |\n| `nearText` | Vector search using a text query | `text2vec-xxx` | Transformers, Contextionary, OpenAI, CLIP, Hugging Face, Cohere |\n| `nearImage` | Vector search using an image | `multi2vec-clip`, `img2vec-neural` | CLIP, Img2Vec |\n| `hybrid` | Combine vector and BM25 search results |   *none* | Learn more |\n| `bm25`   | Keyword search with BM25F ranking  | *none* | Learn more |\n\nFor further information see:\n\n- References: GraphQL: Search operators\n- How-to search: Similarity search\n- How-to search: Image search\n- How-to search: BM25 search\n- How-to search: Hybrid search\n\n## Conditional filters\n\n`Get{}` queries can be combined with a conditional filter.\n\nFor further information see:\n\n- References: GraphQL: Conditional Filters\n- How-to search: Filters\n\n\n## Additional operators\n\n`Get{}` queries can be combined with additional operators such as `limit`, `offset`, `autocut`, `after` or `sort`.\n\nFor further information see:\n\n- References: GraphQL: Additional Operators\n\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "graphql-get", "path": "developers/weaviate/api/graphql/get.md", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/api/graphql/get", "timestamp": "2023-11-13 10:40:05", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
