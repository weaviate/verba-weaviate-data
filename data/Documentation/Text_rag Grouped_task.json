{"text": "\nA 'grouped task' generation wil perform RAG queries on the set of retrieved objects. This is useful when you want to transform the set of objects as a whole, with one prompt.\n\n###  Code\n\nThis example finds entries in \"Movie\" whose vector best matches the query vector (for \"dystopian future\"). Then, instructs the large language model to find commonalities between them.\n\nEach of the results are then printed out to the console.\n\n\n\n##  Explain the code\n\nFor `grouped_task` queries, you simply pass on the prompt to the `grouped_task` parameter. This will instruct Weaviate to pass on the:\n- text properties from all retrieved objects, and\n- the prompt\n\nto the large language model.\n\n\n  Example results\n\n```text\nIn Time\nLooper\nI, Robot\nThe Matrix\nChildren of Men\nThese movies all involve futuristic settings and explore themes related to the manipulation of time, technology, and the potential consequences of advancements in society. They also touch on issues such as inequality, control, and the impact of human actions on the future of humanity.\n```\n\n\n\n###  Optional parameters\n\nYou can also pass on a list of properties to be used, as the `grouped_properties` parameter. This can be useful to reduce the amount of data passed on to the large language model and omit irrelevant properties.\n\n###  Response object\n\nA RAG query with the `grouped_task` parameter will return a response with an additional `generated` attribute. This attribute will contain the generated output for the set of objects.\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "Text_rag Grouped_task", "path": "developers/academy/py/starter_text_data/104_text_rag/30_grouped_task.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/py/starter_text_data/text_rag/grouped_task", "timestamp": "2024-05-08 10:48:19", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
