{"text": "\nCongratulations. You have successfully deployed Weaviate on your Kubernetes cluster, and scaled it to a multi-node setup. \ud83c\udf89\n\nYou can now explore the following resources to learn more about Weaviate and how to use it:\n\nWe have the following beginner courses available for Python:\n- [101T Work with: Text data](../../py/starter_text_data/index.md)\n- [101V Work with: Your own vectors](../../py/starter_custom_vectors/index.md)\n- [101T Work with: Multimodal data](../../py/starter_multimodal_data/index.md)\n\nAnd for TypeScript/JavaScript:\n- [Introduction to Weaviate with TypeScript](../../js/intro_weaviate_typescript/index.mdx)\n\nWhat you could explore, then, is how to adapt these examples to a multi-node case with replication and/or sharding.\n\n### Related documentation\n\nIf you are interested in the architecture behind replication and sharding, please check out the following resources:\n- [Replication](/developers/weaviate/concepts/replication-architecture/index.md)\n- [Horizontal scaling](/developers/weaviate/concepts/cluster.md)\n\nThen, check out the section on [resource planning](/developers/weaviate/concepts/resources.md) to estimate how much resources each node of a particular size might be able to handle, and how to plan your cluster accordingly.\n\nIf you have replication configured, you can apply [tunable consistency](/developers/weaviate/configuration/replication.md) concepts to read/write operations as well as queries.\n\n### Further reading\n\n- How-to guides\n    - [How-to: manage data](/developers/weaviate/manage-data/index.md): Code examples for *create*, *update* and *delete* operations.\n    - [How-to: search](/developers/weaviate/search/index.md): Code examples for all types of search operations.\n    - [How-to: configure Weaviate](/developers/weaviate/configuration/index.md): Guides for configuring Weaviate, such as [PQ](/developers/weaviate/configuration/pq-compression.md) and [BQ](/developers/weaviate/configuration/bq-compression.md) compression, [backups](/developers/weaviate/configuration/backups.md) and [replication](/developers/weaviate/configuration/replication.md).\n- [Concepts guides](/developers/weaviate/concepts/index.md): Guides for understanding Weaviate's architecture and concepts.\n- [API reference](/developers/weaviate/api/index.md): Detailed information about Weaviate's APIs.\n\n\n\nSee you soon! \ud83d\udc4b\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "K8s Next_steps", "path": "developers/academy/deployment/k8s/90_next_steps.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/deployment/k8s/next_steps", "timestamp": "2024-05-08 10:47:32", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
