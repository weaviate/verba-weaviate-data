{"text": "This page describes how to run Weaviate from source (git checkout / tarball) locally.\n\nYou can find the source code at the Weaviate repo.\n\nPrerequisites:\n* Go v1.20 or higher\n* (optional) Docker\n\n## Running from source\n\nThe fastest way to run Weaviate from source is to issue the command below:\n\n```bash\ntools/dev/run_dev_server.sh \n```\n\nWhere `` is _one_ of the server configuration (`$CONFIG`) values in `/tools/dev/run_dev_server.sh`. For example, you can run:\n```bash\ntools/dev/run_dev_server.sh local-openai\n```\n\nTo run the server locally with the OpenAI module.\n\nThe default configuration is `local-development` which will run the server locally with the `text2vec-contextionary` and `backup-filesystem` modules.\n\nYou can also create your own configuration. For instance, you can clone an entry (`local-all-openai-cohere-palm` is a good start) and add the required environment variables.\n\n\n## Running with Docker\n\nTo run with Docker, start up the Weaviate container and the container(s) for any additional services with\n\n```bash\ntools/dev/restart_dev_environment.sh [additional_services]\n```\n\nthen run the development server as described in the section above.\n\nFor example, the setup below uses Docker Compose to spin up Prometheus and Grafana instances. Those are pre-configured to scrape metrics from Weaviate. Using this setup, you can:\n- access Weaviate on port `8080`\n- access Grafana on port `3000` (Login: `weaviate`/`weaviate`)\n- if necessary for debugging -  access prometheus directly on port `9090`\n\n```bash\ntools/dev/restart_dev_environment.sh --prometheus && tools/dev/run_dev_server.sh local-no-modules\n```\n\nThis setup is for contributors to the Weaviate code base. If you are an end-user of Weaviate looking for a Prometheus-enabled example, please see this documentation page or this example.\n\nBelow are more examples of running Weaviate with Docker.\n\n### Transformers t2v only\n\n```bash\ntools/dev/restart_dev_environment.sh --transformers && ./tools/dev/run_dev_server.sh local-transformers\n```\n\n### Contextionary t2v & Transformers QnA\n\n```bash\ntools/dev/restart_dev_environment.sh --qna && ./tools/dev/run_dev_server.sh local-qna\n```\n\nThe above commands are subject to change as we add more modules and require specific combinations for local testing. You can always inspect restart_dev_environment.sh and run_dev_server.sh to see which options are available. The first option without any arguments is always guaranteed to work.\n\nTo make queries from a web interface, use the WCS console to connect to `localhost:8080`.\n\n\n## More Resources\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "weaviate-core-setup", "path": "developers/contributor-guide/weaviate-core/setup.md", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/contributor-guide/weaviate-core/setup", "timestamp": "2023-11-13 10:39:48", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
