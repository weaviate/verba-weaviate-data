{"text": "\n\n\nThis page illustrates various use cases for [vector databases](https://weaviate.io/blog/what-is-a-vector-database) by way of open-source demo projects. You can fork and modify any of them.\n\nIf you would like to contribute your own project to this page, please let us know by creating an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-io/issues).\n\n## Similarity search\n\nA vector databases enables fast, efficient similarity searches on and across any modalities, such as text or images, as well as their combinations. Vector database' similarity search capabilities can be used for other complex use cases, such as recommendation systems in classical machine learning applications.\n\n|Title | Description | Modality |

databases help to address some of large language models (LLMs) limitations, such as hallucinations, by helping to retrieve the relevant information to provide to the LLM as a part of its input.\n\n|Title | Description | Modality | Code |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Verba, the golden RAGtriever ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSt3sFT1i18 ),
