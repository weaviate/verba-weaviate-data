{"text": "\nWeaviate stores data in \"collections\". A collection is a set of objects that share the same data structure. In our movie database, we might have a collection of movies, a collection of actors, and a collection of reviews.\n\nHere we will create a collection of movies.\n\n##  Code\n\nThis example creates a collection for the movie data:\n\n\n\nEach collection definition must have a name. Then, you can define additional parameters like we've done in this example.\n\n##  Explain the code\n\n###  Properties\n\nProperties are the object attributes that you want to store in the collection. Each property has a name and a data type.\n\nIn our movie database, we have properties like `title`, `release_date` and `genre_ids`, with data types like `TEXT` (string), `DATE` (date), or `INT` (integer). It's also possible to have arrays of integers, like we have with `genre_ids`.\n\n#### Auto-schema\n\nWeaviate can automatically [infer the schema](/developers/weaviate/config-refs/schema/index.md#auto-schema) from the data. However, it's a good practice to define the properties explicitly, for better control and to avoid surprises.\n\n###  Vectorizer configuration\n\nIn this code example, we specify the vectorizer as `none`, as we will specify our own vectors.\n\n\n\n###  Generative configuration\n\nIf you wish to use your collection with a generative model (e.g. a large language model), you must specify the generative module.\n\nIn this code example, we specify the `openai` module (`generative-openai` is the full name) with default options.\n\n\n\n###  Python classes\n\nThe code example makes use of classes such as `Property`, `DataType` and `Configure`. They are defined in the `weaviate.classes.config` submodule and are used to define the collection.\n\nFor convenience, we import the submodule as `wc` and use classes from it.\n\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "Object_collections Create_collection", "path": "developers/academy/py/starter_custom_vectors/102_object_collections/20_create_collection.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/py/starter_custom_vectors/object_collections/create_collection", "timestamp": "2024-05-08 10:47:56", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
