In this section, we will delve deeper by reviewing the various vector search methods available in Weaviate, such as `nearVector`, `nearObject`, and `nearText`.\n\nAlong with vector search methods, you will also discover filters that can be employed to accompany search operators. For instance, you will learn how to search for data objects that exclude specific criteria.\n\nAs we examine these capabilities, we will simultaneously use them as a means to gain insight into the inner workings of Weaviate.\n\nUpon completing this unit, you will possess a thorough understanding of how to effectively query Weaviate to obtain desired results, as well as the underlying mechanisms that make it all possible.\n\n### &nbsp;&nbsp;Prerequisites\n\n- (**Required**) A Python (3) environment with `weaviate-client` installed.\n- (**Required**) Complete 101A Weaviate Academy Preparation\n- (*Recommended*) Complete Hello, Weaviate\n\n## &nbsp;&nbsp;Learning objectives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "zero_to_mvp-queries_1", "path": "developers/academy/zero_to_mvp/102_queries_1/index.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/academy/zero_to_mvp/queries_1", "timestamp": "2023-11-13 10:39:23", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
