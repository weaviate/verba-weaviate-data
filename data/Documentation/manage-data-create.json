See Manage data: multi-tenancy operations for details on how.\n\n### Object data vs collection definition\n\nCompared to the collection definition, the object data:\n- Can omit defined properties.\n- Can include new properties.\n\nAny new properties will be added to the collection definition during object creation with auto-schema.\n\n#### Example\n\nThis example shows how to create an object in the `JeopardyQuestion` collection, with:\n- An existing property (`question`),\n- A new property (`newProperty`), and\n- Omits an existing property (`answer`).\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n## Optional parameters\n\nOptionally, you can specify an id or a vector.\n\n### `id`\n\nYou can optionally specify an ID in UUID format. Otherwise, Weaviate will generate a random UUID.\n\n### `vector`\n\nYou can optionally specify a vector to represent each object. Otherwise, Weaviate will follow the relevant vectorizer setting.\n\n### Example\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n## Preventing duplicates\n\nIn Weaviate, the only unique field is the `id`. If you try to create an object with an existing id, Weaviate will throw an error. (In batch imports, Weaviate will overwrite the object if one exists.)\n\nTo prevent duplicates, we suggest:\n- Using a deterministic ID generation method, and\n- Checking if an object exists before creating it.\n\n### Generate deterministic ID\n\nYou can do so with the `generate_uuid5` function in the Python client, or the `generateUuid5` function in the TypeScript client.\n\n### Example\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n\n```java\n// This feature is under development\n```\n\n  \n\n  \n\n```go\n// This feature is under development\n```\n\n  \n\n\n### Check if an object exists\n\nYou can check if an object exists given its id.\n\nCollections and tenants each work like namespaces. So, it is possible to have the same id in different collections and/or tenants.\n\n## Validating before creation\n\nYou can validate an object against the collection definition before creating it.\n\nThis will confirm:\n- Whether the creation of an object will succeed, and\n- That it doesn't have any extra properties vs. the defined collection properties.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "type": "Documentation", "name": "manage-data-create", "path": "developers/weaviate/manage-data/create.mdx", "link": "https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/manage-data/create", "timestamp": "2023-11-13 10:40:50", "reader": "JSON", "meta": {}, "chunks": []}
