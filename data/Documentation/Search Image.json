{"text": "\n`Image` search uses an **image as a search input** to perform vector similarity search.\n\n\n  \n    Additional information\n  \n\n**Configure image search**\n\nTo use images as search inputs, configure an image vectorizer [module](../configuration/modules.md) for your collection.\n\nFor details, see the modules reference page:\n\n- [img2vec-neural](/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/img2vec-neural.md)\n- [multi2vec-clip](/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/multi2vec-clip.md)\n- [multi2vec-bind](/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/multi2vec-bind.md)\n\n\n\n## Named vectors\n\n\nAny vector-based search on collections with [named vectors](../config-refs/schema/multi-vector.md) configured must include a `target` vector name in the query. This allows Weaviate to find the correct vector to compare with the query vector.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n## By local image path\n\nUse the `Near Image` operator to execute image search.\nIf your query image is stored in a file, you can use the client library to search by its filename.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n\n  > Not available yet.
